# The Algorithm Remembers

## Part One: The Body in Freetown

The body lay in a corner of Christiania where the murals met the mud, face-up in the February drizzle. Twenty-eight years old, track marks still fresh on his left arm. To anyone else on the Copenhagen police force, it would have been open-and-shut. Just another overdose in Freetown, where the hash dealers and squatters had their own rules.

But Detective Sara Vestergaard knew better than to trust the obvious.

She stood under her umbrella, watching the tech team photograph the scene. Six years on the force. Five years sober. She'd learned to see the details that other detectives missed, the ones that didn't fit the comfortable narrative.

"Wallet's still here," said Henrik, her partner, crouching beside the body. "Phone too. Hundred kroner in cash."

"Not a robbery," Sara murmured. She pulled on gloves and knelt beside the victim. His jacket was expensive—Patagonia, barely worn. Clean fingernails. Recent haircut. She'd seen enough addicts to know the difference between someone in active use and someone who'd been taking care of themselves.

"ID says Mikkel Christensen," Henrik said, handing her the wallet. "Address in Nørrebro."

Sara pulled out her own phone and searched the name. LinkedIn profile came up immediately. Junior developer at a fintech startup. Smiling photo, professional background. Two years at the company.

Two years.

"Check his phone," she said.

Henrik raised an eyebrow but pulled out an evidence bag. The phone was unlocked—Face ID still worked, apparently, even on the dead. A few swipes and Henrik's expression changed.

"NA meeting reminder. Yesterday at 7 PM. And look at this—he's got a sobriety counter app. 784 days."

Sara felt something cold settle in her chest. Not the good kind of cold, the kind that came with winter rain and hot coffee after. The other kind. The kind that came with cases that didn't make sense.

"Two years, one month, and nineteen days," she said quietly. "That's a long time to stay clean."

"Maybe he relapsed." Henrik shrugged. "Happens, right?"

It did happen. Sara knew that better than anyone. She still went to meetings twice a week, still counted her days even though she'd stopped tracking them on apps after the first year. But something felt wrong.

"Bag everything," she said. "I want to see his digital footprint."

---

## Part Two: Pattern Recognition

Mikkel Christensen's apartment told a story of someone rebuilding their life. Plants on the windowsill, mostly alive. Bookshelf organized by color. Meal prep containers in the fridge. A yoga mat rolled up by the door.

Sara stood in his living room while the forensics team worked, scrolling through the preliminary phone data on her tablet. Henrik had sent it over from the station. With the victim's phone unlocked and next-of-kin permission pending, they'd done a quick data pull.

His calendar was meticulous. Gym sessions. Therapy appointments. Coffee with sponsors. Team meetings at work. No gaps, no missed obligations. Right up until three days ago, when the entries stopped.

But his app usage told a different story.

Sara pulled up the screen-time data. In the last week, Mikkel's phone use had spiked. Instagram, up 300%. Spotify, up 250%. TikTok, which he'd barely touched in months, suddenly showing two-hour sessions.

She opened Instagram. His posts were aspirational—gym selfies, nature photos from weekend hikes, motivational quotes about recovery. But his feed was different. The algorithm had served him something else entirely.

Photos of parties. Old friends from his using days, tagged in club check-ins. Throwback posts from his own timeline, resurfaced by the algorithm's "On This Day" feature. Ads for nightclubs in Vesterbro, cocktail bars in Meatpacking District. Sponsored posts for energy drinks that looked suspiciously like the ones he'd used to mix with vodka.

Sara felt her stomach tighten.

She switched to Spotify. His own playlists were full of lo-fi beats and ambient music. But his "Discover Weekly" and "Daily Mix" had taken a turn. Every song from 2019-2020. The soundtrack to his addiction, apparently. Songs he'd probably listened to while high, now served back to him with algorithmic precision.

Even Google Maps. She pulled up his location history. In his last week, the app had started suggesting routes that took him past Vesterbro Station, right through the streets where—according to his old arrest records—he used to score.

"Henrik," she called out. "Come look at this."

Her partner leaned over her shoulder, squinting at the screen. "What am I looking at?"

"His digital life. Look at what the algorithms were showing him in the last week."

Henrik scrolled through a few screens. "Lot of party stuff. Think he was using again?"

"Maybe. Or maybe something was pushing him toward it."

"Algorithms don't push, Sara. They respond. If he was searching for this stuff—"

"He wasn't." She pulled up his search history. "Look. No searches for clubs. No searches for alcohol. No searches for drugs. He was looking up hiking trails and meal prep recipes. But somehow, his feeds all shifted anyway."

Henrik frowned. "That's... weird."

"It's more than weird. It's targeted."

---

## Part Three: Four More Bodies

She found the pattern by accident.

Three days after Mikkel's body turned up, Sara was at her Tuesday morning meeting in a church basement in Frederiksberg. She'd been going to this group for four years. Knew most of the faces. Trusted the routine.

But this week, someone was missing.

"Anyone heard from Sofie?" asked the group leader, an older man named Jens.

Heads shook. Sara felt a prickle of unease.

After the meeting, she pulled Jens aside. "How long has Sofie been coming?"

"Two years, maybe? She was solid. Never missed a meeting." He rubbed his face. "I tried calling yesterday. No answer."

Sara got Sofie's last name and ran her through the system when she got back to the station. Sofie Andersen, 34, worked as a dental hygienist. No arrests, no outstanding warrants. But there was a flag on her medical records—an ER visit four days ago. Overdose. DOA.

Sara's hands went cold.

She pulled the case file. Different district, different detective. Ruled as accidental overdose. Routine. But Sara requested a data dump from Sofie's phone anyway, citing an ongoing investigation.

When the data came through, her pulse quickened.

Same pattern. App usage spike in the last week. Instagram feed full of triggering content. Spotify pushing songs from her using years. Even her YouTube recommendations had shifted—from cooking tutorials to party vlogs.

Sara started searching the database. Overdose deaths in Copenhagen in the last three months. Cross-referenced with recovery program attendance. Found two more.

Thomas Nielsen, 41. Nine months sober. Overdose in Sydhavn.

Marie Olsen, 29. Eighteen months sober. Overdose in her apartment in Østerbro.

She requested phone data for both. Waited through the bureaucratic delays, the digital forensics backlog, the jurisdictional red tape. Finally, a week later, she had what she needed.

Four victims. Four phones. Four identical patterns.

Someone was weaponizing the algorithms against people in recovery.

---

## Part Four: The Dark Web Marketplace

Henrik thought she was reaching.

"Correlation isn't causation, Sara. Maybe they all just... fell back into old patterns. Started searching for the wrong things. The algorithms picked up on it."

"Without any search history? Without any trigger?"

"People relapse. You know that."

She did know that. She'd seen sponsors fall off the wagon, friends from meetings disappear. Recovery was hard. Relapse was common. But this felt different.

"I want to check something," she said. "Come on."

They went to see Jakob in Digital Forensics, a twenty-six-year-old who'd helped her on three previous cases and had a habit of bending rules when he found something interesting.

"Can algorithms be manipulated?" Sara asked. "Like, from the outside?"

Jakob spun his chair around. "What do you mean?"

"Can someone intentionally change what a person sees on social media? Without hacking their account directly?"

"Theoretically?" Jakob leaned back. "Yeah. Algorithms are trained on patterns. If you can poison the training data or exploit how they learn, you could influence what they show specific users. But it would require serious resources. Coordinated activity across platforms."

"Is anyone doing it?"

Jakob's eyes narrowed. "Why do you ask?"

Sara showed him the data. Four victims, four pattern matches. Jakob went quiet, scrolling through the screen-time reports and feed histories.

"Holy shit," he murmured. "This is... this is sophisticated. Look at the timing. The content ramped up gradually. Not all at once—that would be obvious. Just a slow shift in what the algorithms prioritize."

"Can you trace it?"

"Maybe. If there's a service doing this, there'd be digital fingerprints. Let me check some places."

"What places?"

Jakob grinned. "You don't want to know."

---

Three hours later, Jakob called her back to his office. He looked pale.

"Found something. You're not going to like it."

He pulled up a Tor browser, navigated through a series of encrypted links. The page that loaded was sparse—black background, white text, cryptocurrency wallet addresses.

**INFLUENCE MARKET**

**Services:**
- Political persuasion packages
- Brand sentiment manipulation
- Behavioral modification targeting
- **Relapse acceleration (recovery subjects)**

Sara felt her blood turn to ice.

"There's a whole marketplace for this," Jakob said quietly. "You pay in crypto, provide someone's digital profile—social media handles, email, phone number—and they promise to shift the algorithms toward specific behaviors. They've got packages for everything. Making someone more politically extreme. Making them buy certain products. And this..."

He clicked on the relapse package. The description was clinical:

*"Target individuals in addiction recovery. Service employs coordinated data poisoning and engagement manipulation across minimum 4 platforms. Gradual feed optimization toward triggering content. Estimated 73% relapse rate within 14-21 days. Premium package includes geolocation manipulation for physical proximity to acquisition opportunities."*

Premium package. Like they were selling a subscription service.

"How does it work?" Sara asked, her voice hollow.

"A/B testing exploits, mostly. Social media platforms constantly test different content on users to see what drives engagement. These guys have figured out how to game those tests. They create fake accounts that interact with the target, signal-boost certain types of content, poison the recommendation systems. The algorithms think the user's preferences have naturally evolved. But it's artificial."

"Can we trace who's buying?"

"Cryptocurrency makes it hard. But there's one thing." Jakob switched tabs. "They advertise on dark web forums. And one of the forums has a vendor rating system. Someone left a review three months ago. Complained that a 'package' didn't work fast enough. Listed their username."

He showed her the screen. The username was in Danish. **GudenhjelpermigGT**.

"Mean anything to you?" Jakob asked.

Sara stared at it. "Guden hjelper mig. God helps me. GT..."

And then it clicked.

"Gotfred Thomsen."

"Who's that?"

"A dealer. Mid-level cartel operator. We arrested him two years ago on distribution charges, but he walked on a technicality." She was already pulling up his file. "He used to work Vesterbro and Nørrebro. Lost a lot of business when the city expanded its recovery programs."

Henrik, who'd been listening quietly, spoke up. "You think a dealer is buying these packages to win back old customers?"

"Not just one dealer. Look at the victims." Sara pulled up the map. "Four different neighborhoods. Four different dealers' territories. This isn't one guy. It's a coordinated strategy."

"Jesus," Henrik breathed.

Sara stood up. "We need to move on this. Get warrants, raid the—"

"Wait." Jakob held up a hand. "Before you do that, you should know something else. I checked the vendor's profile. They've completed over two hundred transactions in the last six months. And the relapse package is their most popular product."

Two hundred people. Two hundred recovering addicts, targeted by the very technology they used every day.

Sara felt sick.

---

## Part Five: The Investigation Stalls

Building a case turned out to be harder than finding the pattern.

Sara and Henrik brought their findings to their superintendent, a by-the-book career cop named Bergmann who'd been skeptical of Sara's "digital hunches" since day one.

"Let me get this straight," Bergmann said, leaning back in his chair. "You think a dark web service is manipulating social media algorithms to make addicts relapse, and this is somehow murder?"

"Four deaths, sir. All with the same pattern."

"Four overdoses. People in recovery relapse all the time, Detective Vestergaard. It's tragic, but it's not murder."

"They were targeted—"

"Allegedly. By an unverified service on the dark web that you accessed through questionable digital forensics." Bergmann shook his head. "Even if this service exists, how do you prove causation? How do you prove that seeing some Instagram posts *caused* someone to use again?"

Sara opened her mouth, closed it. He was right. The legal theory was a mess.

"And furthermore," Bergmann continued, "you want to go after the social media platforms themselves? Facebook, Instagram, Google? Do you have any idea what kind of legal resources they have? They'll bury us in proprietary system claims. We'll never get past their lawyers."

"So we do nothing?"

"I'm saying you don't have a case. Find me something concrete. Physical evidence. A suspect who'll talk. Until then, these are tragic accidents."

Sara left his office feeling hollow.

---

She tried anyway.

Sent formal requests to Meta, Google, TikTok, Spotify. Asked for internal data on algorithmic changes for the four victims. Requested details on how their recommendation systems worked. Whether they'd detected any unusual coordinated activity targeting these users.

The responses came back identical. Polite corporate language, vague promises of cooperation, and a wall of "proprietary systems" that they couldn't disclose. One company sent a statement that made her want to throw her phone:

*"Our algorithms are designed to show users content they're likely to engage with, based on their usage patterns. We take user safety seriously, but we cannot comment on individual cases or override user choice."*

User choice. As if Mikkel had chosen to see party photos. As if Sofie had opted into a feed full of triggers.

Henrik tried to help. He brought in the drug unit, got them to pick up Gotfred Thomsen for questioning. But Thomsen's lawyer shut down every question about the dark web marketplace. Without physical evidence linking him to the purchases, they had nothing.

Thomsen walked after eight hours.

Two days later, Sara was going through Mikkel's social media again when she noticed something new. A comment on one of his old photos, posted the day before his death.

*"Remember this night, bro? Good times. You still around?"*

The account belonged to someone named Kasper Lund. Sara pulled his profile. Hundreds of followers, but only a dozen posts. All generic. No personal information. And he'd only started commenting on Mikkel's photos in the last week of Mikkel's life.

She checked the other victims. Sofie had three similar accounts that had started interacting with her posts in her final week. Thomas had five. Marie had seven.

All fake accounts. All created within the last six months. All designed to look real enough to fool the algorithms.

This was how they did it. Coordinated fake engagement, pushing the algorithms toward specific content. Making the system think these people wanted to see their old lives again.

Sara documented everything. Built a timeline. Cross-referenced the fake accounts. Some of them had interacted with multiple victims.

But when she brought it to Bergmann again, he barely looked at the report.

"Even if these are fake accounts, so what? Creating a fake Instagram profile isn't illegal. And you still can't prove causation."

"Sir—"

"Drop it, Vestergaard. That's an order."

---

## Part Six: The Algorithm Turns

Sara didn't drop it.

She kept digging. Spent her evenings in the apartment she shared with her cat, going through data dumps and dark web forums. Henrik warned her she was getting obsessed. Her sponsor told her she was using the investigation to avoid dealing with other things.

Maybe they were right.

But then her own feeds started changing.

It was subtle at first. An old photo from 2019 popped up in her Facebook memories. Her and Jonas, her ex-boyfriend, at a wine bar in Vesterbro. She'd deleted most of their photos after the breakup, after he'd shown up drunk to her apartment and she'd realized she couldn't save him. But apparently the algorithm had kept this one.

She scrolled past it. Didn't think much about it.

Then Instagram started showing her ads. Wine bars. Craft cocktail places. A sponsored post for a "Copenhagen Nightlife Guide." She'd never seen these before. Her algorithm knew she was sober—she'd blocked alcohol ads years ago.

But now they were everywhere.

Spotify was next. Her Discover Weekly suddenly filled with songs from 2018-2019. The years when she and Jonas had been together, when she'd been drinking every night, when her life had been a blur of bars and hangovers and mornings she couldn't remember.

She tried to dismiss them. Told herself it was coincidence. Algorithms were weird sometimes.

Then Jonas himself showed up in her Instagram suggestions. "People You May Know."

She hadn't thought about him in four years. Had blocked his number, unfollowed him on everything, built a new life that didn't include the person she'd been when they were together.

But there he was. Profile photo showing him at some beach, grinning. The algorithm thought she might want to reconnect.

Sara put her phone down with shaking hands.

They knew. Whoever was running this operation, they knew she was investigating. And they were sending a message.

---

She called Jakob the next morning.

"My feeds are being manipulated."

"Are you sure?"

"Positive. Same pattern as the victims. Can you check my data?"

Jakob pulled her phone records, her app usage, her engagement metrics. When he called her back, his voice was grim.

"You're right. Someone's targeting you. Started three days ago. Coordinated fake accounts, engagement manipulation, the whole package."

Sara felt cold. "Can you stop it?"

"You'd have to delete everything. All your social media. Email. Even then, if they have your data, they could keep trying through other vectors."

"How do I find out who bought the package?"

"You can't. The marketplace is anonymous. Even if you could trace the crypto, it'd just lead to a wallet."

Sara hung up and stared at her apartment. Her phone sat on the table, screen dark. Every app was a potential weapon now. Every notification could be engineered.

She thought about Mikkel, scrolling through his Instagram in those final days. Seeing his old life reflected back at him, amplified, made seductive by the algorithms. Had he known what was happening? Had he tried to resist?

Or had he just thought his own mind was betraying him?

---

That night, she went to a meeting. Her regular Thursday group in Nørrebro. She needed the routine, the faces, the reminder that she wasn't alone in this.

But her phone buzzed during the opening readings. A text from a number she'd deleted years ago.

**Jonas:** Hey. Saw you in my suggested friends. How've you been?

She turned the phone off.

After the meeting, she talked to her sponsor, Anna, a tough woman in her sixties who'd been sober for twenty-three years.

"Someone's trying to make me relapse," Sara said. "Through my phone."

Anna didn't look surprised. "Screen addiction is real, kid. And if you're investigating something that threatens someone's business..."

"What do I do?"

Anna smiled faintly. "What did people do before smartphones?"

"I need my phone for work."

"Do you? Or do you need to *think* you need it?"

Sara thought about that on the walk home. Passed three bars, two liquor stores. Didn't look at her phone once. Felt the weight of it in her pocket like a loaded gun.

When she got home, she made a decision.

---

## Part Seven: Going Analog

The next morning, Sara walked into a phone store and bought a basic Nokia flip phone. No apps. No social media. Just calls and texts.

She transferred her number, then factory-reset her smartphone. Watching it wipe felt like breaking an addiction all over again. The same anxiety, the same sense of loss. But also relief.

Henrik stared at her new phone like she'd grown a second head.

"You're serious."

"Completely. I can't investigate this if they can manipulate what I see. I need to go offline."

"How are you going to work?"

"Paper files. Face-to-face interviews. Like we did before smartphones."

Henrik shook his head but didn't argue. Maybe he understood. Or maybe he just thought she'd gone off the deep end.

Sara didn't care. For the first time in a week, her mind felt clear.

She started rebuilding the case from scratch. Printed out everything—victim timelines, app usage data, screenshots of the fake accounts. Pinned them to a cork board in an unused conference room. Red string connecting the dots, like something out of a crime show.

It felt ridiculous and necessary at the same time.

She interviewed people in person. Friends of the victims. Family members. Recovery group leaders. Asked them about the last weeks of their loved ones' lives. Heard the same story repeated: they'd seemed different. Distracted. Spending more time on their phones. Pulling away from support systems.

One mother, Mikkel's mom, broke down in tears. "He told me the Instagram was making him sad. Said he kept seeing things he didn't want to see. I told him to just delete it." She sobbed. "I should have made him delete it."

Sara took notes by hand. Let the woman cry. Didn't tell her that deleting wouldn't have mattered. They would have found another vector.

She went back to the dark web marketplace with Jakob. Without her own phone to worry about, she could focus. They tracked vendor communications, analyzed the language patterns, cross-referenced with known cartel operations.

Slowly, a picture emerged.

The service was run by a small team, probably based in Eastern Europe. They sold to anyone, but their biggest clients were in Denmark, Sweden, and Norway. Drug dealers who'd been losing business to expanding recovery programs.

The relapse packages were marketed as "customer retention." Win back your users. Targeted, effective, untraceable.

Sara found a forum post from one satisfied customer: *"Three out of four came back within two weeks. ROI is insane. Best investment I've made."*

Three out of four. Like they were talking about marketing metrics, not human lives.

---

She traced the cryptocurrency payments with help from financial crimes. Found a pattern of transactions from Denmark to the vendor's wallet. Cross-referenced with known dealers. Built a network map.

Gotfred Thomsen was in the center, but he wasn't alone. Five other dealers. All coordinating. All buying packages.

They'd industrialized relapse.

Sara compiled everything into a physical report. Hundreds of pages. Printed, bound, annotated. She bypassed Bergmann and went straight to the prosecutor's office.

The prosecutor, a sharp woman named Rasmussen, listened to her presentation for two hours. Looked through the evidence. Asked pointed questions.

Finally, she leaned back. "This is innovative work, Detective. And disturbing. But I have the same problem your superintendent does. How do I prove causation in court?"

"The pattern is clear—"

"Patterns aren't proof. Defense will argue that these people relapsed of their own volition. That seeing triggering content isn't the same as being forced to use. That addiction is a disease, not a crime, and relapse is a symptom." Rasmussen sighed. "I believe you. But I need a case that'll hold up."

"What if we can get one of the dealers to flip?"

"Then bring me that."

---

Sara went after the weakest link. A low-level dealer named Emil Sørensen who'd bought only two packages. Young, scared, with a girlfriend who didn't know what he did for a living.

Henrik helped her set up the interrogation. They brought Emil in on an unrelated possession charge, then offered him a deal. Reduced sentence if he cooperated on the algorithmic targeting.

Emil's lawyer advised against it. But Emil was twenty-three and terrified. He broke after two hours.

"Gotfred told us about it," he said, voice shaking. "Said it was a new way to bring people back. More reliable than just waiting for them to relapse on their own. We'd give him their social media info, he'd handle the rest."

"Did he tell you how it worked?"

"No. Just that it was some dark web thing. Algorithms or whatever. I didn't really understand it. But it worked. People came back."

"And you didn't think that was wrong?"

Emil looked at her with red-rimmed eyes. "They were already addicts. We were just... reminding them."

Sara felt nauseous. But she kept her voice steady. "We need you to testify against Gotfred."

"He'll kill me."

"We can protect you."

Emil laughed bitterly. "You can't protect anyone. Not from this."

But eventually, he agreed.

---

## Part Eight: The Partner Falls

The case took three months to build. Sara worked it obsessively, running on coffee and determination. Henrik partnered with her every day, managing the digital side while she handled the analog. They made a good team.

But Henrik was struggling.

Sara noticed it slowly. He was spending more time on his phone. Seemed distracted during interviews. Started showing up late to briefings.

She didn't think much of it. Everyone had rough patches.

Then one morning, Henrik didn't show up at all.

Sara called his cell. No answer. Called his apartment. Nothing. Finally, she drove to his building in Frederiksberg and convinced the superintendent to let her in.

Henrik was on the couch. Unresponsive. Needle on the floor beside him.

Sara called emergency services, then performed CPR until the paramedics arrived. They administered Narcan. Henrik gasped back to consciousness, confused and ashamed.

In the ambulance, Sara held his hand while he cried.

"I'm sorry," he kept saying. "I'm so sorry."

"You're alive. That's what matters."

"I don't know what happened. I was fine, and then..." He trailed off.

Sara felt ice in her veins. "When did you start using?"

"I don't know. A few weeks ago? Everything just felt wrong. I kept seeing things on my phone, old photos, old friends. I thought I was just stressed about the case."

"Henrik, were you in recovery?"

He looked away. "Five years clean. I never told you."

"Jesus, Henrik."

"I thought I had it under control. But then my feeds started changing, and I just... I couldn't stop thinking about it. Using. How easy it would be."

Sara's blood turned to ice. She pulled out her Nokia, called Jakob.

"Pull Henrik's phone data," she said. "Everything from the last month."

Jakob called her back two hours later. His voice was hollow.

"Same pattern. He was targeted."

---

Henrik survived. Spent a week in the hospital, then checked himself into a residential treatment program.

Before he left, Sara visited him. Brought him magazines and fruit, the only things the facility allowed.

"They knew you were working the case," she said quietly. "They targeted you to send me a message."

Henrik looked pale. "Did it work?"

"What do you mean?"

"Are you dropping it?"

Sara thought about the cork board in the conference room. The red string connecting dealers to deaths. The printed pages documenting how algorithms could be weaponized. The months of work that had brought them close—so close—to making a case.

And she thought about Henrik on that couch. About Mikkel in the rain. About Sofie and Thomas and Marie and two hundred other people who'd been targeted by their own technology.

"No," she said. "I'm finishing it."

Henrik smiled weakly. "Good. Get those bastards."

---

## Part Nine: The Trial

The trial of Gotfred Thomsen and five co-conspirators became a media sensation. The first case in Denmark—maybe in the world—to prosecute algorithmic manipulation as a form of criminal assault.

The prosecution argued that the defendants had knowingly purchased services designed to manipulate vulnerable individuals into relapsing, which directly led to multiple overdose deaths. That this was premeditated, targeted, and as deliberate as poisoning someone's water supply.

The defense argued that the defendants had only purchased "social media engagement services," that they couldn't have known it would lead to deaths, and that in any case, the victims had made their own choices to use drugs.

Sara testified for three days. Walked the jury through the pattern recognition, the data analysis, the dark web marketplace. Explained how the algorithms had been turned into weapons.

Emil Sørensen testified, voice shaking, about how Gotfred had bragged about the "success rate." How they'd celebrated when former customers came back.

Jakob testified about the technical details. How the fake accounts worked. How the coordinated engagement manipulated recommendation systems.

Family members testified about the weeks before their loved ones died. The changes they'd noticed. The screen time that had spiked.

And Henrik testified from his hospital bed via video link. Told his story of being targeted. Of how the feeds had changed. Of how insidious it felt, like his own mind was betraying him.

The defense tried to poke holes. Argued that correlation wasn't causation. That people relapsed all the time. That you couldn't prove the algorithms had *caused* anything.

But the jury saw the pattern. Saw the two hundred transactions. Saw the vendor's own marketing materials promising "73% relapse rate."

After two weeks of deliberation, they came back with a verdict.

Guilty. All six defendants. Charges: involuntary manslaughter, conspiracy, distribution of controlled substances.

Gotfred Thomsen got fifteen years.

---

But the platforms were never charged.

Sara tried. Rasmussen tried. They brought the evidence to regulators, to tech policy experts, to anyone who would listen.

The companies released statements expressing concern. Promised to review their algorithms. Implemented new "safety features" that were really just PR moves.

Nothing fundamentally changed.

Because the architecture itself was the problem. Systems designed to maximize engagement, to keep users scrolling, to show them what they wanted to see—or what the algorithms *thought* they wanted to see. Systems that could be gamed, exploited, weaponized.

And as long as those systems were protected as "proprietary," as long as user choice was the shield against accountability, nothing would really change.

Sara knew that. Hated it. But she also knew she'd done what she could.

She'd stopped the dealers. Exposed the marketplace. Saved some lives, even if she couldn't save all of them.

It had to be enough.

---

## Epilogue: Five Years Later

Sara still used a flip phone.

People thought it was eccentric, or Luddite, or some kind of performance. She didn't care. She'd learned that digital abstinence was the only way she could trust her own thoughts.

She'd been promoted to detective inspector. Had a team now, young cops who'd grown up with smartphones and couldn't imagine life without them. She tried to teach them to be skeptical. To recognize when their feeds felt manipulative. To go analog sometimes.

Most of them didn't listen. But a few did.

Henrik was three years sober again. Working in digital forensics, teaching law enforcement about algorithmic manipulation. They still got coffee every Tuesday.

The dark web marketplace had been shut down, but Sara knew others had popped up. The model was too profitable. As long as there were vulnerable people and algorithms to exploit, someone would find a way.

But recovery programs had started teaching digital literacy. Sponsors warned newcomers about algorithmic triggers. Apps had been developed to block or randomize feeds, to prevent the kind of targeted manipulation Sara had uncovered.

It was something. Small progress. The kind measured in individual lives saved rather than systemic change.

Sara thought about that on her morning run along the harbor. Copenhagen was waking up around her. People on their phones, scrolling through feeds curated by invisible systems.

Most of them would be fine. Most algorithms were benign, just trying to sell sneakers or recommend music.

But some weren't. And some people were vulnerable in ways the algorithms could find and exploit.

Sara's job was to stand between them. To remember that technology was never neutral. That every system could be weaponized. That the algorithm remembered everything, even the things you wanted to forget.

She finished her run and headed home. Didn't check her phone—didn't need to.

The real world was enough.

**THE END**
