But there are conditions: humanity must show 'narrative development' - progress on self-destructive tendencies. The subscription includes 'viewership metrics' - the aliens will keep watching. If humanity trends boring or too destructive, cancellation can resume. It's not salvation, it's a reprieve. It's also deeply unsettling - existence contingent on cosmic audience approval. But it's survival. The call ends. The team is exhausted, relieved, disturbed. They're alive. Humanity gets another chance. But at what cost? They emerge from the communications room. Kowalski is gone - fled when he realized he lost. Security doesn't know whether to arrest them or thank them. News breaks: Earth renewed. Global celebrations. But Team knows the complicated truth.

Social movements debate whether to perform hope or authenticity. Philosophers argue about observer effect and free will. Life goes on, weirder. Terry returned to the call center one last time - it's being preserved as historical site. He reflects on everything. He's written a book, not commercial tell-all but honest account. He's found purpose again, but it's tempered by knowledge. Shanice opened her own business consulting on 'crisis management and first contact protocols' - using her skills, on her terms. Maya is in therapy but okay. Kevin works for international signal monitoring organization, still tracking. Angela leads global research initiative on observer-effect physics. Kowalski's company went bankrupt; he's writing his own book. The team gathers at Terry's apartment. Bundle calls (they have schedule now). Casual check-in. The cosmic becomes mundane. They chat with alien like customer service call it always was. The irony isn't lost on anyone. After call, they order pizza, watch TV, live their lives. They're being watched. They'll always be watched. But they're also living. The story continues. The subscription holds. For now. Final image: Terry at window, looking at stars, knowing something looks back. He waves. Somewhere, cosmic voyeurs watch. And maybe, that's okay. Maybe being seen, even by incomprehensible others, is better than cosmic loneliness. Or maybe it's horror he's learned to live with.
