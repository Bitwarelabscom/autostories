  "overall_assessment": "EXCELLENT - The five tentpole chapters form a coherent, compelling foundation for Book 1. Timeline is logical, character knowledge is consistent, planted elements pay off appropriately, world rules are never violated, and character arcs progress believably. The bridge chapters between tentpoles have clear purposes and will enhance rather than contradict the structure. No continuity errors found. Ready to proceed with either bridge chapter writing or moving to Book 2 tentpoles.",

    "Write bridge chapters 2-6, 8-11, 13-16, 18-19 to complete Book 1",
    "OR proceed to Book 2 tentpole planning if working on trilogy level",
    "Update character arc_position values in character JSON files to reflect Book 1 ending states",
    "Consider creating voice_samples.md with dialogue examples for character consistency in bridge chapters"
