# The Memory Vault Chronicles

A hard sci-fi thriller trilogy exploring consciousness transfer, identity, and what makes us human in a future where memories can be bought, sold, and stolen.

## Trilogy Structure

- **Book 1: The Vault Keeper** - Discovery and conspiracy
- **Book 2: Fractured Minds** - War and betrayal
- **Book 3: The Last Original** - Revolution and rebirth

## Setting

Neo-Singapore megacity, 2187. A sprawling urban landscape where memory is the ultimate currency and consciousness can be backed up, transferred, or stolen. Society is divided by memory class, and the line between authentic identity and constructed personality has become dangerously blurred.

## Core Themes

1. **Identity beyond memory** - What makes us "us" if our memories can be changed?
2. **The price of immortality** - Consciousness backup promises eternal life, but at what cost to authenticity?
3. **Class warfare through cognitive inequality** - Those with access to better memories lead better lives

## Getting Started

2. Create character files in `characters/` directory
3. Build story graph in `plot/story_graph.json`

### Phase 2: Write Tentpole Chapters
Generate the 5 key chapters that define the trilogy's structure

### Phase 3: Sequential Chapter Generation
Fill in bridge chapters between tentpoles

### Phase 4: Integration Pass
Continuity checking and polish

## World Rules (Immutable)

- Memory transfer degrades original consciousness by 0.3% per transfer
- Copenhagen Protocol: No consciousness can exist in two places simultaneously
- Memory manipulation leaves detectable quantum signatures (72-hour window)
- Black market memory trade is punishable by consciousness dissolution

## Technology Level

- Memory digitization and consciousness backup
- Neural implants (standard for citizens)
- No AGI (artificial general intelligence)
- No faster-than-light travel or communication
- Realistic near-future cyberpunk aesthetic

## Tone

Noir thriller with philosophical undertones. Fast-paced action balanced with moments of existential contemplation. Morally gray characters facing impossible choices in a world where identity itself is mutable.
