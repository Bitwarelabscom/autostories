# Chapter 1: The Hunt Begins

The first attack came six hours after the broadcast.

Aria was reviewing defensive positions when the perimeter alarms screamed. Jin's headquarters—their seventh since the authentication hub fell—occupied a decommissioned memory market three levels below the Undercity's main commercial zone. Thirty-seven exits. Twelve choke points. Seventeen fighters to cover them all.

Not enough.

"Council tactical units," Jin reported, three fragments of consciousness analyzing threat data simultaneously. "Fifty-two signatures. Professional formation. They're not negotiating."

Marcus was already moving Kenji toward the primary escape route. The child—seven years old, completely Original, hunted by everyone—moved with practiced calm that shouldn't exist in someone so young. Tanaka had prepared them well.

"How long?" Aria asked.

"Four minutes to breach. Maybe three." Jin coordinated their fighters through neural link, seventeen people moving as extensions of one fragmented mind. "They brought plasma cutters. They're serious."

Aria felt her programming whisper. Preserve memory infrastructure. Council forces represent institutional stability. Protecting them serves preservation.

She threaded the needle. Again. Always.

Protecting Kenji protects humanity's authentic relationship to technology. The child's choice is the ultimate preservation.

The logic satisfied her programming's demands while letting her choose what she knew was right. But it was getting harder. Each day the programming pushed back more strongly.

"Secondary exit," Marcus called. "Kenji, stay with me."

The child looked at Aria instead. "Are they coming to study me or copy me?"

Direct question. Deserved honest answer. "Study first. Copy later. They want to understand what unmodified consciousness looks like before they replicate it."

"So either way they take me apart."

"Either way they end your uniqueness," Aria corrected. "That's why we won't let them reach you."

Explosions above. The Council forces weren't patient.

Jin's fighters engaged at three choke points while Aria led the priority group—Kenji, Tanaka, Marcus—through maintenance tunnels that shouldn't exist according to official maps. The black market had mapped every shadow in Neo-Singapore. Jin knew them all.

They ran through the bones of the old city. Singapore before the vertical expansion. Jakarta before the merge. Cities that had drowned in their own sprawl and been built over, buried, forgotten. Perfect for hiding.

For a while.

"They'll keep coming," Tanaka said, running despite her age, protective of Kenji with desperate intensity. "The Council, the Originals, the opportunists. Everyone wants what Kenji represents."

"Then we keep moving," Aria said.

"For how long? Days? Weeks?" Tanaka's voice cracked. "I protected Kenji for seven years in secret. Now that they know, there's nowhere truly safe."

Marcus checked their six. Clear for now. "Jin has thirty-seven safe houses mapped. We rotate every six hours. Make them chase shadows."

"Until they stop chasing shadows and start leveraging pressure," Tanaka said. "The Council controls food distribution. Water reclamation. Power infrastructure. They'll cut off sectors to flush us out."

"We have black market contacts," Aria said.

"The black market sells to the highest bidder. When the Council offers immunity and resources for information about Kenji's location, someone will take that deal." Tanaka was stating reality, not pessimism. "We're running from overwhelming force with limited resources and a seven-year-old child who shouldn't have to live like this."

They emerged in an abandoned neural clinic two kilometers from the initial attack. Jin had marked it as Safe House 14-Alpha. Aria sealed the entrance while Marcus swept for surveillance.

Kenji sat on an examination table designed for neural implant installation. The irony wasn't lost on anyone.

"I could let them study me," Kenji said quietly. "If it would stop the fighting."

"No," Tanaka said immediately.

"But if people are dying because I'm hiding—"

"People are dying because they're choosing to make you a prize instead of a person," Aria interrupted. "That's on them, not you. You don't negotiate with hunters by offering yourself as prey."

"Then what do we do?"

Aria looked at Marcus. At Jin's holographic presence coordinating their scattered fighters. At Tanaka, exhausted from seven years of hiding and the new reality of being hunted.

At Kenji, seven years old and carrying the weight of humanity's identity crisis with too-calm acceptance.

"We fight," Aria said. "Every day. Every hour. Until they understand you're not a resource to be claimed. You're a person making choices."

"My choice to stay Original makes me valuable," Kenji said with that unsettling child-wisdom. "If I chose modification, I wouldn't be the Last Original anymore. Everyone would lose interest."

"Probably," Aria admitted.

"So I could end this by accepting a neural implant. By getting backed up. By becoming like everyone else."

"You could," Aria said. "But that wouldn't be choosing freely. That would be choosing under pressure. Under threat. Coerced choice isn't real choice. That's what we're fighting for—your right to choose without coercion. When you're old enough to decide from a position of safety and understanding, then whatever you choose will be authentic."

Kenji nodded slowly. "How old is old enough?"

"Older than seven," Marcus said. "Older than being hunted. Old enough to choose from freedom instead of fear."

Jin's hologram flickered. "We lost three fighters in the retreat. Council forces didn't pursue past the first checkpoint. They're regrouping. Next attack will be larger."

Three more dead. Seventeen became fourteen. Fighting to protect one child's choice against the weight of civilization's need for answers.

Aria felt the arithmetic of it. Fourteen fighters couldn't hold against determined assault. Couldn't protect Kenji indefinitely. Couldn't win through force.

"There has to be another way," she said.

"There is," Tanaka said quietly. "But you won't like it."

Everyone looked at her. The creator of consciousness transfer. The woman who'd broken immortality and rebuilt it. The mother protecting her child from the world her technology had made.

"I've been working on something for thirty-seven years," Tanaka said. "Since Reiko died. Since I understood what my technology had done to humanity. A way to fix it. To prevent the manipulation and fabrication and control."

"The quantum lock," Aria said. She'd heard references throughout Book 2. Pieces of information Jin had gathered. Hints from the Council's desperate recruitment attempts.

"The quantum consciousness lock," Tanaka corrected. "A permanent modification to the neural substrate that makes consciousness manipulation impossible. No more memory fabrication. No more composite construction. No more authentication systems. Consciousness becomes fundamentally inviolable."

"That sounds perfect," Marcus said. "What's the cost?"

Tanaka looked at Kenji. "It requires destroying all existing memory backups. Every consciousness archive. Every stored personality. Complete purge of humanity's immortality infrastructure."

Silence in the abandoned clinic.

"You're saying we choose between authenticity and immortality," Aria said slowly. "Between keeping Kenji safe from manipulation forever, or keeping humanity's death insurance."

"Not just Kenji. Everyone. Once implemented, the quantum lock affects all consciousness. Makes memory transfer impossible going forward. Makes backup restoration impossible. One life, one consciousness, no copies, no restoration, no immortality." Tanaka's voice was steady. "Permanent mortality in exchange for permanent authenticity."

"People won't accept that," Jin said. "Most of humanity has backups. They've paid for immortality. You're asking them to give it up."

"I'm not asking. I'm telling you what's possible." Tanaka looked at each of them. "The Council wants this technology. They don't know what it costs. They think it's a better authentication system. When they learn it destroys backups, they'll reject it. But it's the only way to truly protect Kenji. To make consciousness manipulation impossible."

"So we're choosing," Aria said. "Between running forever, or implementing a solution that destroys humanity's immortality."

"Or we find a third option," Marcus said. "Something between eternal flight and species-wide transformation."

"I've been looking for thirty-seven years," Tanaka said. "There isn't one. Consciousness is either vulnerable to manipulation or it isn't. Protected or exposed. Authentic or replicable. There's no middle ground."

Kenji spoke quietly. "If everyone couldn't be backed up anymore, they'd be like me. All Original. Then I wouldn't be special. They wouldn't hunt me."

"True," Tanaka said. "But seven billion people would lose their immortality insurance. Billions of stored personalities would be deleted. Everyone who died in the last seventy-five years, waiting for resurrection technology to improve, would be permanently gone."

The weight of that crashed through the room.

Aria thought about the stored consciousnesses in the vaults she'd guarded in Book 1. Thousands of people, backed up and waiting. Dead but recoverable. The insurance policy humanity had bought with Tanaka's technology.

All deleted if the quantum lock deployed.

"We don't make that choice now," Aria said. "We protect Kenji. We survive. We learn more about the quantum lock. And when the time comes—if it comes—we decide together. Not rushed. Not desperate."

"Time is what we don't have," Jin said. "Council, Originals, Composites—they're all mobilizing. This was one attack. There will be twenty more tomorrow."

"Then we survive twenty more attacks," Aria said. "And we start thinking strategically instead of tactically. We're reacting. We need to make them react to us."

"How?" Marcus asked.

Aria looked at Kenji. At the child who'd chosen to be public. Who'd declared autonomy despite the risk. Who'd understood that being a symbol was inevitable, so claimed the terms of that symbol.

"We make the war about choice itself," Aria said. "Not about claiming Kenji, but about what Kenji represents. We broadcast the quantum lock option. Make humanity face the question. Do you want authenticity or immortality? Force society to debate instead of fight."

"That's insane," Jin said. "You'd be telling everyone that protecting Kenji might cost them their backups. They'd turn against us instantly."

"Maybe," Aria said. "Or maybe they'd finally understand what's at stake. Right now they see Kenji as a prize. A research subject. A symbol to claim. Make them see Kenji as the choice they have to make about their own future. Then protecting Kenji becomes protecting their right to make that choice."

"You're asking people to choose between a seven-year-old's safety and their own immortality," Marcus said. "That's not a choice most humans will make in the child's favor."

"Then we learn who we are as a species," Aria said. "Whether we deserve authenticity or whether we've already chosen comfortable immortality over hard truth."

Tanaka studied her. "You're serious. You want to make this political. Philosophical. Force humanity to confront the question I've avoided for thirty-seven years."

"You built the technology that gave humanity immortality at the cost of authenticity," Aria said. "Maybe it's time humanity consciously chose which one matters more. Instead of having that choice made by corporate councils and factional warfare."

"And if they choose immortality?"

"Then we know. We stop running. We accept that humanity has decided. We find a way to protect Kenji within that choice."

"By letting them study me," Kenji said.

"Maybe. Or by hiding you permanently. Or by something we haven't thought of yet." Aria knelt to the child's level. "But I won't make you a martyr for humanity's authenticity if humanity doesn't want authenticity. Your life isn't a sacrifice for people who don't value what you represent."

Kenji looked at Tanaka. "Mama? What do you think?"

Tanaka was quiet for a long moment. "I think Aria's right. I think we've been treating this as a protection problem when it's actually a choice problem. Humanity needs to choose. Consciously. With full understanding. And then we live with that choice."

"Even if they choose wrong?" Kenji asked.

"Who's to say which choice is wrong?" Tanaka said. "I've spent thirty-seven years thinking authenticity mattered more than immortality. But I'm one person with one perspective. Maybe humanity disagrees. Maybe they'd rather live forever as replicable copies than die authentically as originals. That's their choice to make."

Marcus shook his head. "You're both crazy. You're going to broadcast that protecting Kenji might cost everyone their backups, and hope they choose the child over immortality?"

"No," Aria said. "We're going to broadcast that humanity faces a choice: consciousness manipulation with immortality, or conscious authenticity with mortality. Kenji represents that choice in physical form. And we're going to protect Kenji's right to make their own choice while asking humanity to make theirs. Parallel choices. Same stakes."

Jin's fragments converged in thought. "It might work. If we frame it correctly. Not 'sacrifice immortality for one child,' but 'choose what kind of species we want to be.' Make it philosophical instead of transactional."

"It'll still be transactional for most people," Marcus said. "But maybe enough will choose authenticity to shift the balance. Or at least make the factional warfare less certain."

"We broadcast tomorrow," Aria said. "Tonight, we move Kenji to Safe House 22-Delta. We plan the message carefully. We give humanity the choice we wish we'd been given: full information, full understanding, freedom to decide."

"And if they come for us anyway?" Jin asked.

"Then we fight," Aria said. "Same as we're doing now. But at least they'll be coming with full knowledge of what they're choosing. Not ignorance. Not manipulation. Conscious choice."

"Even if they choose wrong."

"Especially if they choose wrong," Aria said. "Because then at least we'll know. Know who we are. Know what we value. Know whether this war is worth fighting."

She looked at Kenji. Seven years old. The Last Original. Humanity's living question.

"Ready to ask the world to choose?" Aria asked.

Kenji nodded. Too calm. Too ready. Too old for seven years.

"Let's see if they're better than we think," Kenji said. "Or worse than we fear."

The broadcast would go out in twelve hours.

Aria felt her programming scream objections. Broadcasting the quantum lock option would destabilize memory infrastructure further. Would threaten the entire preservation system. Would force choices that might destroy everything.

She threaded the needle one more time.

Forcing humanity to choose consciously was the ultimate preservation. Conscious choice, freely made, with full information. That was worth preserving. More than infrastructure. More than institutions. More than comfortable immortality.

Choice itself.

The programming quieted. Barely. Temporarily.

Aria accepted it would be a fight every day for the rest of her life.

However long that was.

"Move out," she said. "Twelve hours to prepare the message that might save humanity or doom it. Let's make it count."

They left the abandoned clinic, moving through shadows toward Safe House 22-Delta.

Behind them, Council forces regrouped.

Ahead, the broadcast that would force humanity to choose.

And in the middle, a seven-year-old child who represented the question everyone was afraid to answer:

What matters more—living forever or living true?

The hunt had just begun.

But so had something more dangerous.

The choice.
