# Chapter 8: Waiting for the Vote

Sixteen days after the forum. Fourteen days until the referendum vote. Aria's programming won a battle.

She woke up with weapon in hand. No memory of acquiring it. No conscious choice. Just programming executing while consciousness slept.

Target: Kenji.

She fought. Managed to redirect. Fired into wall instead of child. Woke Marcus with the shot.

"I'm losing," she told him. "Programming's taking over during sleep. Can't fight unconscious. Can't win forever."

"We sedate you," Marcus proposed. "Medical unconsciousness. Can't act on programming if you're drugged."

"Can't protect Kenji if I'm sedated either. Can't function. Can't help."

"You're more danger than help right now."

Truth. Painful truth.

Jin took over primary Kenji protection while Aria fought herself. Fought programming every waking moment. Lost ground every day.

The referendum polling remained stable. 63% against implementation. 22% for. 15% undecided. Tanaka's presentation had clarified positions but not shifted them. People knew the choice. Made it consciously. Chose immortality over authenticity.

Chose wrong. But chose knowingly.

The Authenticists grew violent. If democracy wouldn't implement the lock, they'd force it. Attacks on backup facilities. Attacks on memory storage. Trying to destroy infrastructure to make lock implementation necessary.

Council responded with force. Dozens of Authenticists dissolved. Consciousness deleted. Permanent death as punishment for demanding permanent death.

Irony sharp enough to cut.

The Immortalists celebrated. Every Authenticist attack validated their position. Showed that lock advocates were extremists. Terrorists. People willing to destroy humanity for purity ideology.

Made the 22% pro-lock voters seem dangerous. Made fence-sitters flee toward backup preservation.

"We're losing political ground," Jin reported. "Every Authenticist attack pushes Undecided toward Immortalist camp. Poll shifted. 66% against now. 19% for. 15% undecided. Going wrong direction."

"Let it go wrong," Aria said. Fighting programming. Fighting exhaustion. Fighting losing battle. "People choose. Even wrong choices. That's the point. Not winning. Choosing consciously."

"Philosophy doesn't help if we lose the vote and Kenji stays hunted."

"Philosophy is all I have left. Programming's taking everything else."

Kenji turned eight in the safe house. Older. Wiser. Still carrying weight no child should bear.

"If the vote fails," Kenji asked Aria, "what happens to you?"

"I keep fighting programming. Keep protecting you. Keep choosing until I can't anymore."

"And then?"

"Then I become weapon again. Become what I was made to be. Become programming instead of person. You'll have to kill me. Or I'll kill you. One or the other."

"That's not fair."

"Consciousness isn't fair. It's real. Real is rarely fair."

Marcus organized fallback plans. If vote failed. If programming won. If Aria became threat. He was preparing to kill the woman he loved to protect the child they both swore to guard.

Preparing quietly. Efficiently. With love and grief intertwined.

Aria knew. Approved. Would have demanded it if he hadn't volunteered.

Because consciousness mattered more than survival.

Because choosing right mattered more than living.

Because some things were worth dying to protect.

Even if she'd rather live.

Fourteen days until humanity chose.

Aria wondered if she'd last fourteen days.

Chose to fight anyway.

Because choosing, even futilely, proved consciousness was real.

And real was all she had.
