# Chapter 6: The Forum

The public forum assembled ten thousand people in Neo-Singapore's largest civic space. Billions watching remotely. Every faction represented. Every position voiced.

Aria stood on stage with Tanaka, Marcus, Jin, and Kenji. Facing the Council representatives. The Authenticist leaders. The Immortalist spokespeople. The Undecided questioners.

Facing humanity deciding its future.

"We begin with verified facts," Tanaka said, activating the quantum demonstration equipment. "The quantum consciousness lock is real. Implementation is possible. Cost is exactly as described. Watch."

She ran live demonstrations. Showed quantum entanglement collapse. Showed manipulation becoming impossible. Showed cascade propagation. Let anyone with quantum physics background verify the math in real-time.

The Council's experts tried to argue. Found their alternative proposals publicly debunked by mathematics that didn't negotiate. Found their compromise positions revealed as physically impossible.

Truth demonstrated live. Undeniable.

The Immortalists presented next. Showed holographic testimonies from families of stored consciousness. Parents waiting for children. Children waiting for parents. Lovers waiting for resurrection. Made four billion deletions personal. Made the cost visible.

Powerful. Painful. Real.

The Authenticists countered. Showed victims of memory manipulation. Showed fabricated Composites like Aria who'd been created without consent. Showed consciousness edited by corporations. Made vulnerability visible. Made manipulation's cost real.

Also powerful. Also painful. Also real.

Kenji spoke when invited.

"I'm seven and a half," the child said to ten thousand people and billions watching. "Too young to decide about modification. Too young to choose backup. Too young for permanent consciousness decisions. But old enough to be hunted. Old enough to be called messianic by Authenticists and abomination by Originals. Old enough to carry weight I didn't ask for.

"I want the quantum lock. Want to not be special. Want to just be person who'll choose when I'm ready. But I don't want four billion people deleted for me. Don't want to carry that weight either.

"So I don't know. I'm seven. I'm honest about not knowing. Maybe adults should be honest too. Maybe admit this choice is impossibly hard. Maybe stop pretending your side is obviously right. Maybe choose knowing both options cost everything."

Silence after Kenji finished.

Then the Undecided philosopher stood.

"The child speaks truth. This IS impossibly hard. Both costs are terrible. Both benefits valuable. We're not choosing between good and evil. We're choosing between two different terrible futures. Between different costs we'll carry forever. That honesty is what this forum needed. Not faction warfare. Not political positioning. Just truth about impossible choices."

The Council made final appeal. Promised better backup security. Promised consciousness rights. Promised regulation preventing manipulation. Promised everything except the one thing that mattered: making manipulation impossible.

"You promise regulations," Aria said when her turn came. "Promise laws. Promise oversight. Promise that consciousness will be protected by institutions. But institutions failed. Are failing now. Have failed for seventy-five years. The quantum lock doesn't require trusting institutions. Doesn't require enforcing laws. Makes manipulation physically impossible. That's the difference. Trust versus physics. Which do you prefer?"

The forum continued for twelve hours. Every argument aired. Every position examined. Every faction heard.

No consensus reached. No decision made.

But consciousness achieved. Humanity confronted the choice. Wrestled with it. Chose to keep wrestling instead of accepting easy answers.

Progress.

Painful progress.

But progress.

The vote was scheduled. Thirty days from forum. Full referendum. Humanity choosing: quantum lock implementation or backup maintenance.

Binary. Real. Terrifying.

Aria left the forum exhausted. Programming whisper-screaming. Fighting harder. Losing ground.

"Did we win?" Marcus asked.

"We made them choose consciously," Aria said. "That's winning. Even if they choose wrong."

Thirty days until humanity decided.

Aria wondered if she'd survive thirty more days of programming warfare.

Wondered if it mattered.

Chose to keep fighting anyway.

Because fighting proved she was real.

And real was worth dying for.
