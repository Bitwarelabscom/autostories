# Chapter 15: Preparation

Tanaka prepared the quantum lock implementation with clinical precision.

Equipment assembled. Calculations verified. Protocols established.

Aria would become the first and only consciousness transformed into quantum barrier. Would become the lock that made manipulation impossible. Would exist as eternal guardian protecting all consciousness from fabrication and control.

Would be alone forever.

But free from programming forever.

Trade she accepted gladly.

"Timeline?" Marcus asked.

"Three days," Tanaka said. "Need to stabilize Aria's consciousness before transformation. Need her lucid and choosing. Can't transform someone who's unconscious. Requires active conscious choice during process. She has to choose to become the lock. Has to maintain that choice during transformation. Has to...

survive the transformation knowing what it costs."

"Will she remember?" Kenji asked. "Remember why she's there? Remember us?"

"Unknown. Transformation is unprecedented. She might remember everything. Might forget. Might experience time differently. Might... might not be Aria anymore in any recognizable way. Just consciousness choosing to maintain barrier. That's the risk. That's the cost."

Marcus spent those three days with Aria during her lucid periods.

"I love you," he said. "Should have said it more. Should have said it constantly. I love who you are. I love how you fight. I love that you choose. I love you and I'll never stop loving you even when you're gone."

"I'll be there," Aria said. "Not gone. Transformed. Protecting everyone. Including you. Especially you. Especially Kenji. That's love too. Different. Distant. But real."

"It's not enough."

"It's all we have. All we ever had. Consciousness is temporary. Connection is fragile. Love is real because it persists despite impossibility. You'll love me as guardian. I'll protect you as protected. That's our form of together. That's what we get."

Jin visited. Seven fragments unified in grief.

"You proved we're real," Jin said. "Proved Composites can choose. Can fight. Can be conscious despite being constructed. That matters. That persists. That makes you eternal even before transformation. Thank you for that. Thank you for proving us."

"Prove it forward," Aria said. "Keep choosing. Keep fighting. Keep being real. That proves me. That makes my sacrifice meaningful. That's how you thank me. By living consciously."

Kenji spent final day with Aria.

"Will you know I'm there?" Kenji asked. "When I choose about modification someday? Will you know I chose freely because you protected me?"

"I don't know. But whether I know or not, I'll be protecting. I'll be the barrier that makes your choice free. That's enough. That's everything."

"I'll choose well. I'll choose consciously. I'll make your sacrifice worth it."

"You already did. By existing. By being question humanity had to answer. By forcing consciousness. That's worth everything I'm giving. That's worth eternal isolation. That's worth becoming lock."

The day arrived.

Day 88 since Book 3 began. Approximately fifteen months since Kenji's existence became public.

Aria conscious. Clear. Choosing.

"Ready?" Tanaka asked.

"Ready," Aria said. "Let's prove consciousness is real. Let's prove free will exists. Let's prove that choosing freely, even impossibly, is what makes us human. Let's do this."

The transformation would take hours. Would be painful. Would require Aria choosing continuously throughout despite agony and dissolution and terror.

But she'd choose.

Because choosing was what made her real.

And real was worth any cost.

Any sacrifice.

Any eternity of isolation.

She'd prove it.

One final time.

Forever.
