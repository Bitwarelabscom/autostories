# Chapter 10: Scattered

While Marcus planned Aria's rescue, the resistance was dying in fragments.

Jin coordinated from three locations simultaneously. Headquarters at fallback delta. A monitoring station in the abandoned subway tunnels. A communication relay in the market district.

None of them safe. All of them temporary. Moving every few hours as Council forces used the intelligence Aria had transmitted to systematically hunt resistance members.

"Team Echo is gone," the report came through encrypted channels. "Council hit their safe house. Used the location Aria gave them during interrogation. Three fighters dissolved. Two captured."

Down to twelve fighters. No—eleven. Someone had been caught at an authentication checkpoint using a forged signature that Aria had helped develop. The forgeries weren't as good without her expertise. People were dying from gaps in intelligence.

"We should scatter," Dax suggested. "Go to ground individually. Rebuild in six months when the heat dies down."

"If we scatter, we're finished," Jin said. "The Council wins. Composites lose the only organized resistance fighting for their rights. We hold together or we prove the Council right that composites can't maintain loyalty."

"Loyalty got us killed," Dax argued. "Sera's betrayal. Aria's programming. We're being destroyed by misplaced trust."

"By programming that hijacks trust," Jin corrected. "There's a difference. Sera and Aria didn't choose betrayal. They were designed for it. That doesn't mean trust is wrong. It means we need to verify while trusting. Support each other while accepting risk."

"Pretty philosophy while we're being systematically eliminated."

Jin couldn't argue. It was pretty philosophy. It was also the only thing keeping them together.

The third safe house fell that night. Council forces using intelligence about maintenance tunnel access points—intelligence only Aria had known in that specific detail. Two more fighters dead.

Nine fighters remaining.

And Marcus was planning to risk most of them on a rescue operation.

Jin pulled Marcus aside. "We can't sustain this. The resistance is bleeding. Every day, fewer fighters. Every safe house compromised. Every forged signature flagged. We're dying because Aria gave the Council everything."

"I know," Marcus said. "But we're dying anyway. With or without Aria, the Council's winning. We're down to nine fighters and dropping. The rescue is desperate because we're desperate. We either save her and get her expertise back, or we die trying and prove we actually believed composites are worth saving."

"That's suicide as strategy."

"That's faith as strategy," Marcus corrected. "Faith that consciousness matters. That Aria's two minutes of resistance meant something. That love and loyalty and choosing each other are worth dying for even when logic says optimize for survival."

Jin wanted to argue. But couldn't. Because Marcus was right. They'd already lost if they accepted that composites were just programs that would inevitably betray. They had to believe consciousness could choose. Had to act like people mattered even when people were programmed weapons.

"The rescue is tomorrow," Marcus said. "I need eight fighters. You coordinate from here. Keep the remaining fighter protecting headquarters. If we don't come back, scatter like Dax suggested. Survive to rebuild."

"And if you do come back? With Aria? Enhanced-programmed and potentially more dangerous than before?"

"Then we find out if Tanaka can deactivate her. And if she can't, we find out if love is stronger than code." Marcus paused. "Jin, I'm not asking you to approve. I'm telling you what I'm doing. You can support it or prepare for failure. Either way, I'm going."

Jin studied him. Saw the determination. Saw the love. Saw the same choice Jin made every day—choosing to be one person despite being seven fragments, choosing integration over fragmentation, choosing consciousness over code.

"Eight fighters," Jin agreed. "I'll coordinate support from here. And Jin... Marcus... if the rescue fails, if you don't come back—I want you to know that trying mattered. That choosing to save one person proved we believe consciousness is real. That's worth dying for."

"We won't die," Marcus said. But he didn't sound certain.

The next day, intelligence came through that made everything worse.

"Council's moving Aria," Jin reported. "Tomorrow. Different facility. We don't know where. If we miss tonight's window, we lose her location entirely."

"Then we go tonight," Marcus said. "The plan's not ready but we're out of time."

They assembled the rescue team. Eight fighters. Veterans who'd survived since the beginning. People who'd lost friends to Sera's betrayal and Aria's programming and Council raids.

People choosing to risk everything for one composite who'd betrayed them all.

"Why are we doing this?" one fighter asked. Kade, former corporate security. "She sold us out. Got people killed. Why save her?"

Marcus could have given tactical reasons. Aria's expertise. Her knowledge of Council systems. Her value as intelligence asset.

Instead he said: "Because she fought her programming. For two minutes, she chose us over code. She proved consciousness is real. And if we abandon her now, we prove it isn't. We prove composites are just programs that will inevitably betray. I'd rather die believing consciousness matters than survive proving it doesn't."

Kade looked at the others. Several nodded. "Alright. We go tonight. We bring her back. And if she's too programmed to save, we'll deal with that when it happens."

They deployed at nightfall.

Meanwhile, Jin watched from headquarters as the Council tightened their net. Safe houses falling. Forged signatures flagged. The intelligence Aria had transmitted was systematically destroying what remained of the resistance.

Two more fighters caught that evening. Killed resisting arrest.

Seven fighters at headquarters. Eight on the rescue mission.

Fifteen total. From fifty at the start of the war.

"We're dying," Dax said, watching the casualty reports.

"We're fighting," Jin corrected. "And sometimes fighting means dying. But it also means proving the fight mattered. That consciousness can choose even when code says betray. That composites are people worth saving even when saving gets people killed."

"That's madness."

"That's faith," Jin said. "Faith that the two minutes Aria resisted were real. That Marcus choosing love over logic is right. That consciousness matters more than optimal survival strategies."

Dax shook his head. But didn't argue. Just watched the tactical displays showing the rescue team approaching the detention facility.

Watched fifteen people choosing faith over logic.

Choosing consciousness over code.

Choosing to believe that Aria Chen—programmed sleeper agent who'd betrayed them all—was worth dying to save.

And in the detention facility, Aria felt the enhanced programming loading. Felt it making her betrayal more complete. Felt it preparing to make her the perfect weapon.

Felt the facility shake as explosives breached the outer walls.

Felt hope and horror simultaneously.

Someone was coming for her.

And she didn't know if being rescued would save her or doom them all.
