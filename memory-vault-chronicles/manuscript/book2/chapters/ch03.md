# Chapter 3: Countdown

Jin's new headquarters was a water treatment facility. Abandoned for a decade, hidden in the Undercity's industrial bowels. The irony wasn't lost on Aria—they were planning revolution from literal sewers.

"Eighteen hours until authentication saturation," Jin announced to the assembled fighters. Thirty-two people. Down from fifty before Aria's betrayal. "Council's deploying scanner networks across all Undercity sectors. Once they go live, every composite signature gets flagged. Dissolution teams will follow within minutes."

"We evacuate," Sera said. Jin's composite lieutenant, strategic mind. "Scatter to surface districts. Blend with augmented populations until the sweep passes."

"They'll scan surface districts next," Echo countered. The tactical composite. "Systematic. Methodical. They're eliminating hiding spaces progressively. We run now, we're just delaying."

"Then we fight," another fighter said. "Hit the scanner deployment teams. Destroy the equipment before it goes live."

Aria listened to the debate. Felt the pressure in her head building. The programming wanting her to speak. Wanting her to contribute her expertise to—

To what? Help them? Or sabotage them?

She couldn't tell anymore.

Marcus noticed her silence. Squeezed her hand under the table. Grounding her. Reminding her she could choose.

"Aria," Jin said. "You know authentication systems. What's the vulnerability?"

Everyone looked at her. Thirty-two fighters who'd lost eighteen colleagues. Who knew she was a security risk. Who were desperate enough to ask anyway.

The programming supplied answers immediately. Technical vulnerabilities. Bypass protocols. Exactly how to disable the scanners without triggering alerts.

And underneath: the certainty that she should protect authentication infrastructure. That these people were terrorists. That—

"I can't," Aria said.

Silence.

"Can't help?" Sera's voice was hard. "Or won't?"

"Can't tell if my analysis is tactical advice or sabotage." Aria met Jin's eyes. "My programming is escalating. Every time I think about security systems, it activates. Gives me certainties I can't verify. I don't trust my own expertise anymore."

"Then you're useless to us," someone said. One of the newer fighters. Someone who'd lost friends in the raid.

"She's honest," Jin corrected. "Which is more valuable than expertise when you can't trust the expert." They turned to Aria. "What do you suggest?"

"Verify everything I say against independent sources. Assume my advice is compromised. Have someone who understands security systems check my work." Aria forced herself to continue. "Or don't use me at all. I'm a liability. You all know it."

"You're also proof composites can resist programming," Jin said. "You warned Marcus and me. Pushed past the limits. That matters more than perfect tactical advice."

"Does it matter to the people who died because I was programmed to betray them?"

No one answered that.

The planning continued without Aria's input. They decided to hit three scanner deployment sites simultaneously. Destroy the equipment. Buy themselves forty-eight more hours before Council deployed backups.

It would cost lives. Probably fail. But doing nothing meant certain dissolution for every composite in the Undercity.

Aria felt useless. Dangerous. A weapon that couldn't be safely aimed at any target.

After the meeting, Jin found her in one of the facility's abandoned monitoring rooms.

"You did the right thing," Jin said. "Admitting you can't trust yourself. Most people never get there."

"Most people aren't programmed sleeper agents."

"Most people are programmed by something. Trauma. Ideology. Fear. The code is just more literal for you." Jin sat beside her. "I've got seven people's programming fighting in my head every moment. The hacker says trust no one. The therapist says connect. The enforcer says pre-emptive violence. Maya's love says protect even when it's dangerous. I choose between them. Every decision. Every moment. That's consciousness."

"You were designed to integrate. I was designed to betray."

"You were designed to infiltrate. They didn't design you to care about the people you'd betray. Didn't design you to question. Didn't design you to push past programming limits to warn people." Jin's smile was sad. "They made a mistake. They made you too real. And now you're paying the price for their failure."

Aria felt tears on her face. "I'm scared. Of what I might do. Of not knowing when the programming will win."

"Then we watch you. Monitor you. Create systems that contain the damage if you're compromised." Jin took her hand. "You're family, Aria. Family doesn't abandon family just because they're dangerous. Family figures out how to keep each other safe."

That night, Marcus scanned her implant again. The programming was at ninety-five percent initialization. Nearly ready to fully activate.

"How long?" Aria asked.

"Days. Maybe hours. The progression isn't linear." He showed her the graphs. Neural pathways lighting up. Code warming up. "When it hits one hundred percent, it'll activate. You'll transmit to Council. You'll betray operations. You'll do everything you're programmed to do."

"Can you disable my transmitter? Before it happens?"

"Only by destroying your implant. Which would leave you unable to communicate. Unable to use any neural interface. Essentially disabled in a world built around consciousness tech."

"Better than being a weapon."

"Aria—"

"I mean it. If I'm about to betray everyone, destroy my ability to transmit. Cut me off. I'd rather be isolated than be used as a weapon against people I love."

He pulled her close. "We'll find another way. Tanaka might—"

"Tanaka's in hiding. We don't even know if she's still alive." Aria leaned against him. "Face it, Marcus. I'm a timebomb. The only question is whether I explode before you can defuse me."

"Then we'll watch the countdown together," he said. "And when it reaches zero, we'll figure out if you can choose against it. If consciousness can overcome code."

"And if I can't?"

"Then I'll make sure you can't hurt anyone. And I'll find a way to bring you back."

She wanted to believe him. Wanted to believe love and determination could overcome programming.

But the pressure in her head whispered otherwise.

Ninety-five percent.

Five percent from losing herself completely.

Five percent from finding out if free will was real or just another comfortable lie.
