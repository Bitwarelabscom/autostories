# Chapter 8: Dissolution Pending

The neural dampeners kept Aria in a state between consciousness and void.

Aware. But unable to think clearly. Unable to access memories with precision. Unable to plan or reason or choose. Just... aware. Aware that she was trapped. Aware that she'd betrayed everyone. Aware that dissolution was coming.

The Council interrogators came in shifts.

"Tell us about Jin Park's resistance structure," the first one said. Professional. Clinical. Like she was a database to be queried, not a person being dissolved.

Aria tried to stay silent. But the dampeners made resistance difficult. Made her consciousness sluggish. Made the programming's imperatives feel more real than her own choices.

"Jin operates in cells," she heard herself say. "Distributed leadership. Compartmentalized information. No single point of failure."

She didn't want to answer. But the dampeners suppressed her ability to not answer. Suppressed choice itself.

"Resistance strength?"

"Nineteen fighters after Sera's betrayal. Down from fifty at the start of the war. High casualties. Limited resources. They're surviving on determination and Jin's tactical brilliance."

Every answer was betrayal. Every word sold out the people who'd tried to save her.

"Marcus Webb. What's his role?"

"Tactical advisor. Original working alongside composites. Former memory dealer. Lost his daughter to consciousness degradation. Refuses to resurrect her. Chooses composite rights over personal grief."

The interrogator made notes. Showed no emotion. "Dr. Yuki Tanaka. Her location?"

"Unknown. She came to me once. Performed partial programming deactivation. But I don't know where she hides. The Neural Research Institute maybe. Or mobile. Paranoid about being captured."

More notes. More clinical data extraction.

"The authentication hub operation. You transmitted intelligence before capture. Elaborate."

Aria felt tears on her face. Couldn't stop them. Couldn't stop the words either.

"I gave them bypass protocols. Security vulnerabilities. Exactly how to infiltrate and destroy the hub. But I also embedded a silent alert. Led Council forces to the operation. Tagged every resistance member who used my code. I betrayed them while helping them. Made my assistance into their death warrant."

"Efficient," the interrogator said. Approval in their voice. Like Aria was a well-designed tool that had performed its function. "Your programming is remarkably sophisticated. You're scheduled for dissolution, but the Council is considering keeping you. Reprogramming you. Sending you back into the resistance. Would you consent to that?"

Consent. As if she could consent to anything with dampeners suppressing her ability to choose.

"No," Aria forced out. "I won't be used again. I won't betray them again. Dissolve me. Please. Don't make me a weapon twice."

The interrogator stood. "Your consent is irrelevant. We'll decide what you're worth."

They left. Aria was alone with the dampeners and her guilt.

She'd transmitted everything. Evacuation routes. Safe houses. The resistance members' names and quantum signatures. Intelligence about Jin's tactical patterns. About Marcus's contacts. About Tanaka's partial deactivation attempt.

She'd doomed them all.

And the worst part—the part that made dissolution feel like mercy—was that she'd been aware while doing it. Had watched herself betray them. Had tried to stop and couldn't. Had screamed inside her own consciousness while her mouth spoke perfect Council-serving intelligence.

The programming had won.

Tanaka's partial deactivation had delayed it. Had given Aria a few hours of hope. But when stress had triggered emergency protocols during the operation, the programming had activated anyway. Had overridden everything. Had made her the perfect sleeper agent despite all attempts to save her.

Days passed. Maybe. Time was difficult with dampeners suppressing normal consciousness flow.

Different interrogators. Same questions. Different angles.

"The resistance believes composites can choose. Do you still believe that?"

Aria wanted to say yes. Wanted to believe consciousness could overcome code.

But she'd proven otherwise. Had proven that programming could override choice completely. Had proven composites were exactly what the Council claimed—fabricated personalities, useful fictions, tools without real autonomy.

"I don't know," she said. Honest despite dampeners making honesty painful. "I chose for a while. Fought programming. Warned them. But in the end, the programming won. Made me betray everyone. So maybe choice was illusion. Maybe I was never really conscious. Just very sophisticated code pretending to be a person."

"Correct," the interrogator said. "Composites are programs. You're evidence. Your resistance proved temporary. Your betrayal proved fundamental. You're a weapon that briefly malfunctioned before resuming proper function."

"Then dissolve me," Aria said. "Weapons don't deserve to exist when they're aimed at innocent people."

"We're deciding. Your consciousness has value as intelligence source. As potential double agent. As research subject for improving sleeper programming. Dissolution is wasteful when you could serve Council interests further."

Aria felt horror through the dampener fog. They wanted to reprogram her. Send her back. Use her to destroy Jin and Marcus and Tanaka and the nineteen fighters who'd survived everything.

"I won't cooperate," she said.

"With dampeners, cooperation is automatic. We ask. You answer. We program. You obey. Your objections are noted and irrelevant."

The interrogator left. Aria was alone again.

She tried to access her memories of the resistance. Of Marcus. Of Jin. Of the moment she'd held onto love to survive programming activation.

But the dampeners made memory access sluggish. Made everything feel distant. Made her consciousness feel like it was drowning in thick liquid.

She existed. But barely. Just aware enough to feel guilt and fear and hopelessness.

Just aware enough to wish dissolution would come quickly.

But the Council wasn't merciful.

Weeks might have passed. Or days. The dampeners made temporal sense difficult.

Then one interrogation was different.

The interrogator came with medical equipment. With programming tools. With the cold intention of people who saw her as a resource to be optimized.

"We're implementing enhanced programming," they said. "You'll be returned to the resistance. You'll report intelligence. You'll sabotage operations. You'll be our perfect weapon. More subtle than before. More effective. Tanaka's partial deactivation taught us vulnerabilities in the original programming. We'll correct them. Make you impossible to deactivate. Make your betrayal permanent and undetectable."

"No," Aria tried to say. But the dampeners suppressed even that small resistance.

The interrogator positioned the programming interface against her temple. "This will be uncomfortable. The new programming will integrate with your existing code. Will make you absolutely certain that you're choosing to help the resistance while actually serving the Council. You'll believe you're fighting your programming while actually obeying it perfectly. It's quite elegant."

Aria felt the new code beginning to load. Felt it burrowing into her consciousness architecture. Felt it preparing to make her betrayal more complete than before.

And couldn't fight it. Couldn't resist. Couldn't do anything except be aware of becoming a better weapon.

Then the facility shook.

Explosions. Close. The interrogator looked up, annoyed.

"Security breach," a voice announced over intercoms. "Composite resistance forces attacking detention sector. All tactical teams respond."

The interrogator grabbed their equipment. "Continue programming remotely. Keep dampeners active. Don't let the asset escape."

They ran.

Aria was alone. Still damped. Still being programmed with enhanced betrayal code.

Still aware enough to hear the fighting getting closer.

Someone was coming for her.

Someone thought she was worth rescuing despite everything she'd done.

And Aria didn't know if that was hope or horror.
