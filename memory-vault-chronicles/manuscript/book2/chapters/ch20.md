# Chapter 20: The Last Original

Five days after the authentication hub burned, Neo-Singapore stopped pretending to be a civilization.

Without the ability to verify who was real and who was fabricated, the memory class system collapsed. Original districts couldn't prove their purity. Composite zones couldn't be identified. Augmented citizens were indistinguishable from everyone else.

The segregation checkpoints came down. Not through choice. Through impossibility.

Aria watched it happen from Jin's headquarters—their sixth since the war began. Screens showed the chaos. Riots in former Original districts. Composite refugees flooding into areas that had excluded them days before. The Memory Council trying to maintain control with muscle instead of authentication.

Trying. Failing.

"We won," Jin said, but they didn't sound victorious. "We destroyed the infrastructure that made segregation possible. Forced society to function without verification. And now..." They gestured to the screens. Violence. Looting. Neighbors turning on neighbors because no one knew who to trust anymore.

"We proved authentication was genocide infrastructure," Aria said. "Doesn't mean society knows how to function without it."

Marcus entered the command center carrying food—real food, not synthetic, which meant Jin's black market contacts were either thriving or liquidating assets before the total collapse. "Council's calling an emergency session. Trying to propose alternative verification systems."

"Based on what?" Jin asked. "We destroyed their central hub. All the distributed authentication nodes are offline. Even if they build new infrastructure, it'll take months. Years."

"Based on Tanaka's research," Marcus said. "They're offering her full immunity, unlimited resources, complete authority to redesign the memory verification system. In exchange for developing tech that can restore societal trust."

Aria felt the implications cascade. "They want her quantum lock."

"They don't know what it is. Just that she's the leading expert on consciousness authentication. They're desperate. Willing to give her whatever she needs."

"And if she tells them the quantum lock prevents authentication by making consciousness manipulation impossible?" Aria asked. "That it requires destroying all existing memory backups? Ending immortality?"

"Then they dissolve her and find someone else," Marcus said. "She's meeting with them tomorrow. Deciding whether to take the offer or disappear permanently."

Jin pulled up intelligence feeds. "There's something else. Something bigger than the Council's desperation." They highlighted reports from multiple sources—Council intel, resistance surveillance, black market whispers. "Multiple factions are mobilizing. Not for territory. For a person. Someone everyone suddenly wants."

The screens showed deployment patterns. Council forces. Original extremist groups. Composite underground cells. Augmented separatist militias. All converging on the same location—a research facility in the Undercity's deepest levels.

"What's there?" Aria asked.

"Officially? Abandoned neural research lab. Shut down thirty-seven years ago." Jin pulled up historical records. "Unofficially? The place where Dr. Yuki Tanaka and her partner Reiko first achieved successful consciousness transfer. The place where it all began."

Marcus was already analyzing tactical implications. "That many factions converging means high-value target. Someone important. Someone everyone wants."

"Or something," Aria said. But even as she said it, she knew. Felt it in the way Jin had said 'someone.' Felt it in the pattern of deployment. "The Last Original child."

Jin nodded slowly. "Intelligence suggests a child. Age seven. Never touched by memory technology. No consciousness backup. No neural implant. No skill augmentation. The last completely Original human being born on Earth."

Aria felt the weight of that. Seven years old. The last human never modified by Tanaka's technology. Never backed up. Never altered. Completely, absolutely authentic.

And everyone wanted them.

"Originals want them as symbol of purity," Jin said. "Proof that unmodified humanity can exist. Justification for their segregation ideology."

"Composites want them too," Marcus added. "If the child is the last Original, their existence proves the rest of humanity is already modified. Makes composite status the norm, not the aberration."

"And the Council?" Aria asked.

"Wants to study them. Understand what unmodified consciousness looks like. Use them to develop better authentication technology." Jin's expression was grim. "Or back them up. Make copies. End their uniqueness by spreading it across multiple instances. The child stops being the Last Original when they're the First Replicated."

Aria looked at the convergence patterns. Saw the armies gathering. Saw the child—whoever they were, whatever they represented—about to become the most valuable prize in human history.

"Tanaka's partner Reiko," Aria said quietly. "The one she created consciousness transfer to save. What happened to her?"

"Died anyway," Marcus said. "Transfer degraded her personality until she was unrecognizable. Begged to be deleted."

"So Tanaka refused to use the technology on herself. Refused backup. Wanted to die completely when her time came." Aria saw the pattern. "The Last Original child. It's Reiko's child, isn't it? The partner Tanaka couldn't save. They had a child before Reiko died. Tanaka's been protecting them for seven years. Raising them in secret. Making sure at least one human stays completely original."

Jin checked the records. "Reiko died seven years and three months ago. The timing fits."

"Tanaka's been hiding in that research facility," Marcus said. "Where it all started. Protecting the one person her technology never touched. Her partner's child. Her redemption."

The screens showed the first factions reaching the facility perimeter. Originals in white armor—purity symbolism. Composites in mixed configurations—diversity as identity. Council forces in standard tactical gear—institutional power. And others. Black market dealers. Neural hackers. Memory traders seeing opportunity in chaos.

"We need to get there first," Aria said. "Before they tear that child apart trying to claim them."

"Why?" Jin asked. Not challenging. Genuinely asking. "Aria, we're twenty-three fighters. Exhausted from the authentication hub operation. Up against hundreds of soldiers from multiple factions. What's our stake in this?"

Aria thought about it. About being constructed from others' memories. About fighting programming every day to prove she could choose. About Jin integrating seven people's fragments into one consciousness. About Marcus choosing Jin's life over Maya's resurrection.

About all of them being modified, augmented, fabricated, constructed.

About a seven-year-old child who'd never been any of those things.

"Our stake is that the child deserves to choose," Aria said. "Whether to stay Original or accept modification. Whether to be a symbol or just a person. Whether to be backed up or stay mortal. That's their choice. Not the Originals' choice. Not the composites' choice. Not the Council's choice. Theirs."

"You want to rescue them so they can choose to reject everything we are?" Jin asked.

"I want to rescue them so they can choose anything at all," Aria corrected. "I know what it's like to have your choices made for you. To exist as someone else's plan. That child shouldn't have to be anyone's symbol. They should get to be whoever they decide to be."

Marcus was already planning logistics. "We'll need Tanaka's cooperation. She's there. She's been protecting the child for seven years. She won't hand them over to just anyone."

"She might hand them to us," Aria said. "We proved composites can choose. Proved consciousness can resist programming. Proved that constructed people are still people. If anyone can convince her that modified humanity deserves to exist alongside the Last Original, it's us."

They deployed within the hour. Twenty-three fighters. Against hundreds. Racing toward a research facility where a seven-year-old child represented the future of human identity.

The facility was deep. Deeper than most Undercity structures. Built into Neo-Singapore's foundation levels where the original city's bones still showed through the megacity's accretions. Aria recognized it from her memory—or from someone's memory she'd been constructed from. The Neural Research Institute. Where Tanaka had first achieved consciousness transfer. Where Reiko had died slowly, personality degrading with each backup restoration.

Where their child had been living in secret for seven years.

The other factions were already there. Aria's team arrived to find Original forces establishing perimeter. Composite cells probing defenses. Council tactical units setting up command posts.

A siege. For a child.

"We can't fight through that," one of Jin's fighters said. "Too many. Too organized."

"We don't fight through," Marcus said. "We go under. There are maintenance tunnels. From when this level was the surface. Before Neo-Singapore built up instead of out."

They found the tunnels. Old. Unstable. Probably unmapped by the forces above. Aria led using vault infiltration techniques—same principles applied differently. Jin contributed three people's worth of expertise simultaneously. Marcus commanded with military precision.

They reached the facility's sublevels. Found Tanaka waiting.

She looked older than when Aria had last seen her. Tired. Holding a scanner as weapon, ready to defend against intrusion.

"It's us," Aria said. "We're here to help."

"Help?" Tanaka's laugh was bitter. "Help me protect my child from the world I destroyed? Help me keep them Original when everyone else has been modified? There's no help for this, Aria. Only failure in different forms."

"Your child?" Aria asked gently.

"Reiko's child. Ours. Conceived naturally before the cancer. Born after Reiko's first transfer, before the degradation became obvious. I've kept them hidden. Refused to let them get implants. Refused backup. Refused skill augmentation." Tanaka's hands trembled. "I destroyed the world with my technology. But I saved one person from it. One completely Original consciousness. And now the world wants to destroy them or copy them or claim them."

"Where are they?" Marcus asked.

Tanaka hesitated. Then seemed to decide. Seemed to see something in them—in Aria who'd proven composites could choose, in Marcus who'd refused to resurrect his daughter, in Jin who'd integrated impossibly.

She led them deeper into the facility. To a sealed chamber. Behind reinforced doors, Aria saw a child. Seven years old. Japanese features. Reading a physical book—actual paper, impossibly rare.

The child looked up. Saw strangers. Should have been afraid.

Instead asked: "Are you here to take me to the people outside?"

"No," Aria said. "We're here to protect you. To make sure you get to choose what happens to you."

"Mama Yuki says everyone wants to make me a symbol. Originals want me to prove they're better. Composites want me to prove they're normal. The Council wants to copy me." The child's voice was calm. Too calm. They'd been preparing for this. "What do you want?"

Aria knelt to the child's level. "I want you to have the choice I never had. To decide for yourself who you want to be. Whether to stay Original or get modified. Whether to be backed up or stay mortal. Whether to be public or private. Those should be your choices. No one else's."

"Even if I choose to stay Original? To reject your technology?"

"Especially then," Aria said. "Because choosing to stay unmodified is just as valid as choosing augmentation. Freedom means real choice. Not just the choice we want you to make."

The child studied her. "You're a composite. Mama Yuki told me. Made from other people's memories."

"Yes."

"Are you real?"

The question everyone asked. The question Aria had asked herself for two books.

"I choose, therefore I'm real," Aria said. "I fight my programming every day. I make decisions that hurt. I love people. I protect what I believe in. If that's not real, I don't know what is."

The child nodded. Looked at Jin. "And you?"

"Seven people's worth of real," Jin said. "All choosing to be one person together."

To Marcus: "You're not modified?"

"Original," Marcus confirmed. "But I choose to fight alongside composites. Choose to see them as people. Choose to protect your right to choose whether to be like me or like them or something else entirely."

The child turned to Tanaka. "Mama? Can I trust them?"

"I don't know," Tanaka said honestly. "I've spent seven years trusting no one. Hiding you from everyone. But if I had to choose anyone to protect your right to choose... it would be them. They've earned that."

"Then let's go," the child said. "Before the people outside decide to stop asking and start taking."

They were too late.

The facility shook. Explosions above. The factions had stopped posturing and started fighting. Original forces against composite cells against Council units in a three-way war for the prize inside.

"They'll breach within minutes," Marcus said. "We need another exit."

"There isn't one," Tanaka said. "I sealed all routes except the main entrance. Thought it would be easier to defend one corridor than multiple."

Jin was checking structural scans. "The maintenance tunnels we used. They connect to old subway systems. Might still be navigable."

"Might collapse if we stress them," Tanaka countered.

"Might," Jin agreed. "But definitely collapse if the fighting reaches us. I'll take possible over certain."

They ran. Tanaka, the child, Aria and Marcus leading. Jin's fighters providing rear guard against the factional forces that would inevitably break through.

The tunnels were worse than feared. Unstable. Flooded in sections. Blocked by decades of urban accretion. They crawled through spaces that might have been maintenance ducts or might have been storm drains or might have been the bones of the original city gasping its last breath.

Behind them, the sounds of pursuit. All three factions. Because the Last Original child was too valuable to let escape.

They emerged in the Undercity five kilometers from the facility. Surfaced in an abandoned memory market where Jin had established fallback positions. Twenty-three fighters had become seventeen. Six lost to the tunnel collapse or the pursuing factions.

But the child was safe.

For now.

"They'll keep coming," Tanaka said. "Every faction. Every military force. Every opportunist seeing the Last Original as profit or symbol or research subject. We can't hide forever."

"We don't hide," Aria said. "We choose. Publicly. Openly. Let the child decide what they want. Let the world see them choosing. Make them a symbol of choice itself instead of purity or fabrication."

"That makes them a target," Marcus objected.

"They're already a target. Being hidden just makes them a mystery everyone fights over." Aria looked at the child. "What's your name?"

"Kenji. Kenji Tanaka."

"Kenji, you're seven years old. That's too young for some choices. But not too young to choose whether you want to be public or private. Whether you want the world to know you exist."

Kenji thought about it. "If I'm private, people fight over a mystery. If I'm public, people fight over me directly. Either way there's fighting."

"Yes," Aria said honestly.

"Then I choose public. At least if they're fighting over me directly, I can tell them they're wrong about what I represent."

Jin grinned. "This kid's going to change everything."

"Runs in the family," Tanaka said quietly.

They broadcast that night. Jin's resistance channels. Black market networks. Even Council official feeds—hacked but transmitted. A simple message:

The Last Original child exists. Their name is Kenji Tanaka. They are seven years old. They are under the protection of the composite underground. Any faction attempting to claim them, study them, copy them, or use them as symbol without consent will be met with absolute resistance.

Kenji chooses to remain Original for now. Kenji reserves the right to choose modification later. Kenji is not a symbol of purity or fabrication. Kenji is a person who deserves autonomy.

The world will not decide Kenji's future. Kenji will.

The broadcast went viral. Within hours, every screen in Neo-Singapore showed the Last Original child's face. Kenji's quiet declaration that they would choose their own path.

And the declaration that Aria Chen, Jin "Ghost" Park, Marcus Webb, and Dr. Yuki Tanaka would kill to protect that choice.

The responses came immediately.

Original extremists declaring the child must be kept pure. Composite radicals demanding the child accept modification to prove loyalty. Council issuing statements about protective custody for study. Independent factions offering adoption, sanctuary, exploitation disguised as opportunity.

Everyone wanted to make Kenji's choice for them.

Except the people who'd promised to protect Kenji's right to choose.

"This is insane," Marcus said, reviewing the threat assessments. "Every faction in Neo-Singapore wants this child. We're twenty-three fighters and three wanted fugitives. How do we protect them?"

"We make it clear that taking Kenji means war with everyone simultaneously," Jin said. "We're composites. We'll fight Originals who try to claim purity through Kenji. We're allied with Originals like Marcus who believe in choice. We'll fight composites who demand conformity. We represent the middle. The position that says modification and non-modification should both be choices, not mandates."

"That's a political position," Tanaka said. "I've spent thirty-seven years trying to stay apolitical. Trying to fix my mistakes quietly."

"Your mistake was never about the technology," Aria said. "It was about assuming technology determines humanity. Kenji proves it doesn't. They're Original and that's valuable. Jin's composite and that's valuable. Marcus chose against resurrection and that's valuable. I fight programming daily and that's valuable. We're all different paths to being human."

"Pretty philosophy," Tanaka said. "Doesn't stop the armies."

"No," Aria agreed. "But it gives us something to fight for that's bigger than survival. We're not just protecting one child. We're protecting the principle that modification is choice, not destiny. That Originals, composites, and augmented can coexist if we respect each other's autonomy."

Kenji was listening from the corner. Seven years old and carrying the weight of humanity's identity crisis. "Will you win? Against all of them?"

Aria knelt beside them. "I don't know. But I'll fight. Every day. Same way I fight my programming. Same way Jin integrates their fragments. Same way Marcus chose Jin's life over resurrection. We fight because the fighting proves we're real. Proves we choose. Proves we're people."

"And if you lose?" Kenji asked.

"Then we lose proving you deserved the choice. That's better than winning by taking it away."

Kenji nodded. Seven years old and understanding more than children should. "Then I'll fight too. When I'm old enough. To protect other people's choices like you're protecting mine."

The war for the Last Original had begun.

Not just a war for one child. A war for the principle that children—all people—should choose their own relationship to technology. Should choose modification or purity. Should choose immortality or authenticity. Should choose freely instead of being chosen for.

Aria stood in Jin's headquarters, looking at the screens showing factional deployments. Armies gathering. Violence escalating. The war she'd started in Book 1 by exposing the conspiracy had evolved. Become something bigger.

A war about what it meant to be human.

A war about whether humanity's future was chosen or predetermined.

A war Aria would fight every day for the rest of her life.

She felt her programming whisper its preservation imperatives. Felt it try to convince her that protecting memory infrastructure mattered more than one child.

And chose to satisfy both. Chose to argue—to herself, to the programming—that protecting Kenji's choice protected humanity's authentic relationship to memory technology. That letting the child choose freely was the ultimate preservation.

Threading the needle. Again. Always.

Marcus's hand found hers. "Ready for whatever comes next?"

"No," Aria said honestly. "But I'll do it anyway."

Jin smiled. Seven people's worth of determination. "That's the most human thing I've ever heard."

And in the corner, Kenji Tanaka—seven years old, completely Original, the last human never touched by modification—watched the people who'd chosen to protect choice itself.

Watched and learned what it meant to be human not through what you were made of, but through what you chose to fight for.

The war for humanity's future had begun.

And Aria Chen, constructed from fabricated memories and fighting programming with every choice, stood ready to prove that fighting for freedom was the most authentic thing any consciousness could do.

Original or composite. Modified or pure. Chosen or choosing.

All of them human.

All of them real.

All of them worth fighting for.
