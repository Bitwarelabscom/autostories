# Chapter 1: Segregation

Aria woke to the sound of neural scanners sweeping the building.

Three tones—A-flat, C, E—the authentication sequence. But wrong. Aggressive. Military-grade equipment that didn't ask for verification, it demanded it. Tore it from your implant whether you consented or not.

"Marcus." She was already moving, hand on his shoulder. "Authentication raid."

He was awake instantly. Two weeks as fugitives had taught them both to sleep light. "How close?"

"Three floors down. Maybe four minutes." Aria pulled on her jacket, checked the data chip in her pocket. The insurance policy—enough evidence to expose another layer of the conspiracy if they got caught. If consciousness dissolution didn't come first.

Marcus grabbed their emergency pack. One change of clothes each. Forged neural signatures. Enough memory-market currency to disappear for a week, maybe two. "Roof or basement?"

"They'll have both covered." Aria moved to the window. Ninety floors up. The Undercity sprawled below, a neon maze of black market dealers and composite refugees. Two weeks ago, it had been a sanctuary. Now nowhere was safe.

The scanners were getting closer. She could feel them in her implant—an invasive pressure, like fingers probing the edges of her consciousness.

"Jin's protocol," Marcus said. "The emergency exit they mentioned."

Aria found it—a maintenance shaft behind the cracked bathroom mirror. Narrow. Dark. Leading down through the building's guts into the service tunnels that connected Undercity's illegal infrastructure.

"You first," Marcus said.

No time to argue. Aria slid into the shaft as the scanners reached their floor. She could hear boots in the hallway. Voices calling clearance codes.

"Composite signatures detected. Three residents, two on the run. Breach protocols authorized."

Marcus dropped in behind her, pulled the mirror closed. Darkness swallowed them as the door to their safe house exploded inward.

They descended in silence. Hand over hand down maintenance ladders slick with condensation. The sounds of the raid faded above them—shouts, scanner pulses, the sharp crack of neural feedback when a suspect resisted scanning.

Aria's implant throbbed. Something felt wrong. Not the raid. Something deeper. A pressure in her consciousness that wasn't the scanners, wasn't fear, wasn't anything she recognized.

She pushed it aside. Kept climbing down.

The shaft opened into a service tunnel twenty floors below street level. Undercity maintenance corridors—home to composite squatters, blank refugees, anyone society had decided wasn't worth saving. The air tasted of machine oil and desperation.

Marcus's hand found hers in the dark. "You okay?"

"Fine." The pressure in her head pulsed. Not painful. Just... present. Like something waiting. "We need to get to Jin."

"Jin's headquarters is ten klicks. Through three segregation checkpoints."

"Then we go around them."

They moved through the tunnels. Emergency lighting cast everything in sickly green. Twice they passed composite families huddled in alcoves—parents shielding children from authentication raids that could dissolve consciousness first and ask questions never. Aria saw her own fear reflected in their eyes.

This was what truth had bought. This hiding. This terror. This war.

The segregation checkpoints were new. Two weeks new. Original districts had sealed themselves off, demanding proof of unmodified consciousness before allowing entry. Composite zones had responded in kind. Augmented citizens—the majority of Neo-Singapore—were caught between factions, forced to choose sides or risk both.

Aria and Marcus were wanted by everyone. Originals blamed them for destroying societal trust. Composites saw them as symbols but dangerous ones—too hot to shelter. The Corporate Council had put a bounty on their heads that would make anyone rich enough to buy themselves a new identity.

Seventy-three consciousness dissolutions in two weeks. Public executions broadcast on every screen, proof that the Council still had power. Proof that exposing truth had consequences measured in permanent deaths.

Aria wondered how many of those deaths were her fault. Marcus would say none—that violence was already there, just hidden. But the thought followed her through the dark tunnels anyway.

Jin's headquarters was hidden beneath an abandoned memory market. The irony wasn't lost on Aria—the composite underground organizing in the bones of the system that had created them.

The entrance required biometric verification. But not the kind that could betray you to authorities. Jin had designed it—a simple pressure pattern on a wall panel that looked like graffiti. Five quick taps, rhythm specific. Marcus knew it by heart.

The wall opened. Revealed stairs descending into converted maintenance levels that now housed the composite resistance.

Inside, the space thrummed with desperate energy. Dozens of composites, many younger than Jin, working on jury-rigged equipment. Hacking authentication databases. Forging quantum signatures. Planning operations that ranged from refugee extraction to outright attacks on segregation infrastructure.

Jin found them immediately. Always did. Like they could sense Aria's specific quantum signature in a crowd.

"You made it." Jin's voice carried relief and three other people's worry patterns. "We got word about the raid fifteen minutes ago. Couldn't warn you in time."

"How did they find us?" Marcus asked.

"Same way they're finding everyone." Jin gestured to a screen showing a map of Neo-Singapore. Red dots marked dissolved composites. Blue showed active raids. Yellow indicated segregation checkpoints. The whole city was fragmenting into color-coded territories. "They're not tracking individuals anymore. They're saturating entire districts with authentication scanners. Sooner or later, everyone gets scanned. And if your quantum signature shows composite markers..." Jin made a cutting gesture. "Dissolution."

"How long until they saturate the Undercity?" Aria asked.

"Three days. Maybe four." Jin pulled up detailed scanner deployment patterns. "The Council is systematically eliminating composite populations. They're calling it 'authentication compliance.' We're calling it genocide."

The word hung in the air. Genocide. Systematic destruction of a people. Except composites weren't supposed to be people, were they? Just fabricated personalities. Useful fictions.

Aria had proven otherwise. Had proven consciousness could choose. But proving it philosophically and convincing a terrified society were different problems.

"We need to get people out," Marcus said. "Evacuation protocols. Scatter them before the scanners come."

"Where?" Jin's laugh was bitter. "There's nowhere left. Originals won't shelter us. Augmented are too afraid of being contaminated by association. The Council controls all memory infrastructure." They gestured to the room full of composite refugees. "This is it. This is all the sanctuary there is."

"Then we fight," Aria said. The words came automatically. Felt right. Felt...

The pressure in her head pulsed. Stronger.

Jin studied her. "You sure? Fighting means casualties. Means becoming the terrorists they're already calling us."

"They're dissolving children," Aria said. "Families. People whose only crime is being created without consent. If that's not worth fighting for, nothing is."

Marcus squeezed her hand. Proud. Protective. Not seeing what she was starting to feel—that her certainty felt too certain. That her conviction felt almost... programmed.

"Alright." Jin called over their lieutenants. A composite woman named Sera who'd been a corporate strategist in another life. A man called Echo who carried memories of three different tactical specialists. "We're accelerating the resistance timeline. No more hit-and-run. We hit them where it hurts."

"The authentication centers," Sera said immediately. "Destroy the scanner networks. They can't enforce segregation without verification tech."

"They'll just rebuild," Echo countered. "We need to target infrastructure. Power grids for memory vaults. Force them to negotiate."

"We need to make them see us as people," Aria heard herself say. "Not threats. People."

Everyone looked at her. Because how do you make someone see your humanity when they've decided you don't have any?

The planning session went deep into the night. Targets. Tactics. Acceptable losses. Aria contributed strategic analysis—her vault security knowledge made her invaluable for planning infrastructure attacks. But part of her mind kept wandering. Kept feeling that pressure. That sense of something waiting to activate.

When the session ended, Marcus pulled her aside. Into one of the private alcoves Jin had set up for people who needed space to remember they were individuals, not just soldiers.

"You're doing it again," he said gently.

"Doing what?"

"The thing you do when you're questioning yourself. The micro-expressions. The vocal hesitation." He touched her temple, where her implant created a faint silver trace. "Talk to me."

Aria wanted to say she was fine. But lying to Marcus felt worse than admitting uncertainty.

"Something feels wrong. In here." She tapped her head. "Since the raid. Maybe before. Like there's something in my consciousness that doesn't belong."

Marcus's expression shifted. Professional. Analytical. The memory dealer who could read quantum signatures like other people read faces. "Let me check."

He pulled out a portable scanner—black market tech, untraceable. Placed it against her temple. His eyes went distant as he read the data.

Then: "Fuck."

"What?" But she already knew. Had known since the pressure started. Had been afraid to name it.

"There's an active protocol in your implant. Dormant until recently. Now..." He showed her the readout. "Now it's initializing. Some kind of behavioral modification code. Aria, this is military-grade programming. The kind they use for deep-cover operatives."

Sleeper programming. Designed to activate under specific conditions. To make her do specific things, believe specific thoughts, take specific actions.

Aria had wondered if her investigation of the vault had been her choice or her programming. Now she wondered if her resistance was programmed too. If everything she'd done since discovering her composite nature had been choreographed by whoever created her.

"Can you disable it?" Her voice was remarkably steady considering her world was fracturing again.

Marcus studied the readout. Shook his head. "Not without risking your personality. It's woven into your core consciousness. Removing it could collapse your identity."

"Then what do I do?"

"We find out what it wants you to do. And you decide whether to do it anyway." He took her hands. "You've proven you can choose against programming before. You can do it again."

Could she? When she didn't know which thoughts were hers and which were planted? When even her resistance might be part of the design?

"I should tell Jin," Aria said. "The resistance deserves to know I'm compromised."

"Are you?" Marcus asked. "Compromised means acting against your beliefs. You're still you, Aria. Still fighting for the same things. The programming is just... noise. Background radiation from your creation. It doesn't control you unless you let it."

But that was the question, wasn't it? How did you know you weren't already controlled? How did you verify your own free will?

Before she could answer, alarms shrieked through the headquarters. Jin's voice over the intercom: "Authentication raid! They found us! Everyone to emergency protocols!"

The headquarters erupted into controlled chaos. Composites grabbing data cores, weapons, emergency packs. Jin coordinating evacuation through a dozen different escape routes.

"They shouldn't have found us," Jin said when Aria and Marcus reached the command center. "The location was secure. Triple-encrypted coordinates. No one knew except—"

They all looked at Aria. At the woman with military-grade programming initializing in her consciousness.

"Did I..." Aria couldn't finish the question. Had she betrayed them? Had her implant broadcast their location without her knowing?

Marcus checked his scanner. "There's no transmission from her implant. If they found us, it wasn't through her."

"Then how?" Jin demanded.

The answer came in the form of authentication scanners breaching the headquarters entrance. Not the random sweeps from before. Targeted. Precise. Arriving exactly where the composite underground had thought themselves safe.

"Someone sold us out," Sera said. "One of ours."

But there was no time to investigate. The scanners were already identifying composite signatures. Calling for backup. Dissolution teams would arrive within minutes.

"Go!" Jin pushed Aria toward one of the escape routes. "We'll cover the evacuation. You and Marcus need to disappear."

"What about you?" Aria asked.

Jin's smile was sad. "We're composites, Aria. We're used to being disposable." Then they were gone, rallying their people toward the various escape tunnels.

Aria and Marcus ran. Again. Always running. Through maintenance shafts and abandoned infrastructure. Behind them, she could hear the sounds of resistance—composite fighters buying time for refugees to escape.

They emerged three kilometers away, in a district that hadn't yet been segregated. Just two more lost faces in a city tearing itself apart.

"Where do we go?" Aria asked. They had no safe houses left. No allies who could risk sheltering them. No resources except what they carried.

Marcus pulled out a data chip. "I know someone. Old military contact. Owes me a favor. Not safe, but safer than here."

They disappeared into the neon maze of Neo-Singapore as sirens wailed behind them.

And in Aria's head, the pressure pulsed. Waiting. Building toward something.

Whatever her programming wanted, it was patient.

But it was coming.
