# Chapter 9: Grieving

Marcus hadn't slept since the operation.

Three weeks. Seventy-two hours of planning, eighteen days of hunting for Tanaka, six days of planning the rescue. No sleep. Just guilt and determination and the certainty that he couldn't leave Aria in Council custody.

"You need rest," Jin said, finding him in the makeshift command center. Fallback delta now—their seventh headquarters since the war began. Fourteen fighters remaining. Five lost in the authentication hub operation when Aria's betrayal had led Council forces directly to them.

"I'll rest after we get her back," Marcus said.

"If we get her back. The Council detention facility is maximum security. We lost half our fighters last time we hit a Council stronghold. We're fourteen people against institutional power." Jin pulled up the facility schematics. "I'm not saying don't try. I'm saying acknowledge the reality. This might kill all of us. And we might fail anyway."

"Then we fail trying," Marcus said. "Because the alternative is abandoning her to dissolution. Abandoning her to being used as a weapon again. She fought her programming. She warned us. She tried. I won't give up on her because trying is hard."

Jin studied him. "This isn't just about proving composites deserve rescue. This is about her specifically. You love her."

"Yes," Marcus admitted. No point denying it. "I love someone I might have to kill if her programming activates again. I love someone who betrayed me. Who got people killed. Who might be better off dissolved than reprogrammed and sent back. I love her anyway."

"That's not logical."

"Love isn't," Marcus said. "If it was logical, I'd have let you extract Maya's consciousness from your integrated mind. I'd have resurrected my daughter and let you die. Logic said Maya mattered more—she was my actual child. You're seven strangers wearing her memories. But I chose you anyway. Because logic doesn't account for who people become. Who they choose to be. You chose to be a person. Aria chose to fight her programming. Those choices matter more than logical optimization."

Jin sat beside him. "I miss her too. She's... she proved something I needed to see. That composites can resist programming even at ninety-eight percent. That consciousness is real even when constructed. When she warned us before her activation, when she fought it for those two minutes—that mattered. Proved we're not just code."

"Then help me save her," Marcus said. "Not because it's logical. Because she's family and family fights for each other."

"I am helping. I've got twelve fighters committed to the rescue. We're planning the operation. Coordinating with Tanaka. But Marcus, you need to face reality. Even if we rescue her, she might be more compromised now. Three weeks of Council interrogation. Programming reinforcement. Neural dampeners breaking down her resistance. We might rescue someone who's more weapon than person."

"Then we help her fight it again. Tanaka deactivates what she can. We monitor her. We give her chance after chance until she proves she can't choose. But we don't assume she's lost until she proves it."

Jin nodded slowly. "Alright. But you need to sleep. Four hours minimum. Because the rescue is in two days and you'll be leading the infiltration team. You're useless if you collapse from exhaustion."

Marcus wanted to argue. But Jin was right. "Four hours. Then we finalize the operation."

"Four hours," Jin agreed. "I'll watch the intelligence feeds. If anything changes, I'll wake you."

Marcus made it to his quarters. Lay down. Tried to sleep.

But all he could see was Aria's face when she'd realized the programming was activating. The terror. The awareness that she was betraying everyone while unable to stop.

The moment she'd told them to run before she could transmit their location.

Two minutes of resistance. Two minutes of choosing consciousness over code. Two minutes that proved she was a person worth saving.

He must have slept eventually. Because Jin was shaking him awake.

"What happened?" Marcus was alert immediately.

"Intelligence update. Aria's scheduled for enhanced programming. They're not dissolving her. They're making her worse. More subtle. Then sending her back to us." Jin showed him the intercepted Council communications. "We have forty-eight hours before the programming is complete. After that, she becomes the perfect undetectable weapon."

Marcus felt cold. "Then we move up the rescue. We go tomorrow night."

"We're not ready. The plan needs another three days minimum."

"We don't have three days. We have one." Marcus pulled up the operation timeline. Started cutting corners. Making it faster, riskier, more desperate. "We strip out the safety margins. We go light and fast. We get in, grab her, get out."

"That's suicide."

"It's necessity," Marcus corrected. "Enhanced programming means Tanaka might not be able to deactivate her at all. Means we'd be rescuing someone who'd destroy us more effectively than before. We go now while there's still a chance to save her."

Jin looked at the modified plan. Looked at Marcus. "You're willing to risk fourteen fighters for a chance?"

"I'm willing to lead the mission myself. Anyone who volunteers comes. Anyone who thinks it's suicide stays. I won't order people to die for my choice."

"It's not just your choice," Jin said quietly. "It's what Aria would want us to do. She'd want us to risk saving her. Because that's what proving composites are people means—acting like people matter even when it's dangerous."

They called the fighters together. Laid out the situation. The forty-eight hour deadline. The enhanced programming. The risks.

"Who's willing to try?" Jin asked.

Twelve hands went up.

Two fighters stayed out—new recruits, barely trained. Jin nodded. "You two stay. Guard headquarters. If we don't return, scatter. Survive. Tell people what happened here."

The two fighters looked relieved and guilty. But they nodded.

"The rest of us plan the rescue," Jin said. "We go tomorrow night. We bring Aria home. And if the enhanced programming makes her a threat, we deal with it. But we don't abandon her to the Council's use."

They spent the next twenty-four hours planning. Stripping away safety margins. Accepting risks that made the authentication hub operation look cautious.

Tanaka arrived twelve hours before the operation. Looked at the plan. Shook her head.

"This will get people killed," she said.

"Probably," Marcus agreed. "But it's the only chance to save Aria before enhanced programming makes her unsavable."

"What if she's already unsavable? What if three weeks of dampeners and interrogation have broken her consciousness beyond repair?"

"Then we learn that when we rescue her. But we don't assume it in advance." Marcus met Tanaka's eyes. "You said consciousness can choose. That constructed consciousness is real. Aria proved it. Now prove you believe it by helping us save her."

Tanaka pulled out her equipment. "I'll need at least twelve hours of surgery. Probably more if they've layered enhanced programming on top of her existing code. And the success rate drops significantly with each programming iteration. First deactivation was sixty-forty. This might be thirty-seventy. Against her."

"Noted," Marcus said. "Can you be ready?"

"I'm ready now. The question is whether you are. Because if the rescue succeeds and the surgery fails, you'll have to decide whether to keep her conscious knowing she's been programmed to destroy you. Whether love is worth that risk."

Marcus thought about it. About loving someone who might be weaponized against him. About choosing her anyway because consciousness and choice mattered more than safety.

"Yes," he said. "Love is worth that risk. Because the alternative is proving the Council right—that composites are just tools. That programming determines everything. That consciousness doesn't matter. I'd rather die proving consciousness matters than survive proving it doesn't."

Tanaka smiled sadly. "My partner Reiko said something similar. Before the degradation. Before consciousness transfer killed who she was. She said love was choosing someone's personhood over your own safety. I didn't understand then. I understand now."

"Then help us save Aria," Marcus said. "Help us prove Reiko was right."

"I will," Tanaka promised. "And when we rescue her, I'll do everything I can to deactivate the enhanced programming. Sixty-forty odds or thirty-seventy—we'll fight for every percentage point."

The operation launched the next night.

Twelve fighters. One Original. One scientist carrying salvaged equipment.

Against the Memory Council's maximum security detention facility.

For one composite who'd betrayed them all and deserved rescue anyway.

Because that's what family meant.

That's what choosing consciousness over code meant.

That's what Marcus chose.

And in thirty-six hours, he'd know if choosing love over logic had been wisdom or fatal mistake.
