# Chapter 2: Old Debts

Marcus's military contact lived in the industrial sector, three zones away from the latest authentication raids. The building looked abandoned—intentionally. Perfect cover for someone who wanted to stay off Council radar.

"Alvarez," Marcus said when the door opened. "I'm calling in the favor."

The woman who answered was mid-forties, military posture, neural implants that marked her as augmented but not composite. She studied Marcus, then Aria, with the assessment of someone trained to identify threats.

"Webb. Didn't think you'd ever cash that chip." Alvarez stepped aside. "Come in. Quickly."

The safe house was sparse. Functional. Military-efficient. Aria recognized the setup—defensive positions, multiple exits, surveillance equipment monitoring the streets below.

"This is Aria Chen," Marcus said.

"I know who she is." Alvarez's expression was unreadable. "Everyone knows. The composite who exposed the conspiracy. The weapon who chose truth. You're either a hero or a terrorist depending on who's asking."

"Which one do you think?" Aria asked.

"I think you made the Memory Council very angry. And very scared. That's worth something." Alvarez pulled up security feeds. "You've got maybe forty-eight hours here. After that, my position gets compromised. Council's running systematic sweeps. Sooner or later they'll check every augmented veteran with connections to black market dealers."

"Two days is enough," Marcus said. "We just need to regroup. Figure out our next move."

Aria felt the pressure in her head pulse. The programming, still there. Still waiting. She'd been monitoring it obsessively since Marcus's scanner had revealed it. Every moment wondering when it would activate fully.

"You okay?" Alvarez asked, noticing her wince.

"Fine. Just... headache." Not a lie. The programming felt like a headache. Like something pressing against her consciousness from the inside.

Alvarez didn't look convinced but didn't push. "I've got rations. Basic medical supplies. And information, if you want it. Word on the street is Jin's underground lost fifteen people in the raid you escaped. Council dissolved them. Public executions to send a message."

Fifteen dead. Because she existed. Because whoever had created her had built a weapon that betrayed anyone trying to help.

"Did Jin survive?" Marcus asked.

"Yeah. They're rebuilding. Slower. More cautious. But still fighting." Alvarez paused. "They're saying you two are still committed to the resistance. That true?"

"Yes," Aria said. Before Marcus could answer. "We're committed."

"Even though you're a walking security risk?" Alvarez gestured at Aria. "Marcus told me about your programming. That you don't know when it'll activate. How do you fight for freedom when you can't trust your own mind?"

It was the question Aria had been asking herself. The question that made the pressure worse, made her wonder if even her desire to resist was programmed.

"I fight anyway," she said. "Because the alternative is letting the programming win. Letting someone else's design determine who I am."

Alvarez studied her for a long moment. Then nodded. "Alright. You can stay. But I'm monitoring you. And if I see any sign you're compromised, I'm putting you down before you can betray anyone else. Clear?"

"Clear," Aria agreed. Because it was fair. Because she'd do the same.

They spent two days in Alvarez's safe house. Marcus coordinated with Jin remotely—encrypted channels, careful protocols. Jin was rebuilding the resistance but needed time. Needed to verify loyalties after someone had betrayed their headquarters location.

"They think it was me," Aria said on the second night. She and Marcus were alone, reviewing intelligence reports. "Jin's people. They think I transmitted the location."

"Your implant didn't transmit," Marcus reminded her. "We verified."

"But someone did. And I'm the convenient explanation. The composite with programming. Easy to blame."

"Jin doesn't blame you."

"Jin's compassionate. The others aren't required to be." Aria felt the pressure spike again. Stronger this time. Like the programming was testing boundaries. "Marcus, what if they're right? What if I did betray them and don't remember? What if the programming can make me do things without me knowing?"

He put down the reports. Took her hands. "Then we deal with it. We find a way to disable it or contain it or fight it. But we don't assume you're guilty of things you haven't done."

"How do you have that much faith in me?"

"Because I've seen you choose. Repeatedly. Against your own interest. Against your own survival. You chose to investigate the vault when it would have been safer to stay ignorant. Chose to help me when you could have turned me in. Chose to expose the conspiracy when it meant becoming a fugitive." He squeezed her hands. "Programming or no programming, those choices were real. Were yours."

The pressure in her head pulsed. Whispered that preservation of memory infrastructure mattered. That she was making mistakes. That she should—

She pushed it down. Chose to ignore it. Chose Marcus's faith over the programming's certainty.

For now, it worked.

On the third day, Jin sent a message. Council was accelerating authentication saturation. The Undercity sweeps would begin within twenty-four hours. Everyone needed to evacuate or go even deeper underground.

"Time to move," Marcus said.

Alvarez helped them with supplies. Forged authentication signatures that might buy them a few hours if they were scanned. Contact information for other sympathetic augmented veterans who might provide temporary shelter.

"You're going to get yourself killed," Alvarez said to Marcus at the door. "Staying with her. Fighting for composites. The smart play is to cut your losses."

"Smart play doesn't mean right play," Marcus said.

"No. It means you survive." But Alvarez was smiling slightly. "Good luck, Webb. Try not to die for another two weeks. I've got a bet running on how long you last."

They left at nightfall. Disappeared into the Undercity's depths. Toward Jin's new temporary headquarters. Toward a resistance that was smaller, scared, but still fighting.

And Aria felt the programming pulse with every step. Counting down toward activation. Waiting for the perfect moment to betray everything she was trying to protect.

She just had to keep choosing against it. Keep fighting her own certainty. Keep proving that consciousness could resist even when the odds said it shouldn't.

One choice at a time.

For as long as she could.
