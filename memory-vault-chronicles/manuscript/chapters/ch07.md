# Chapter 7: The Memory Thief's Evidence

The Undercity memory market smelled like ozone and desperation. Aria kept her corporate jacket folded in her bag and her neural implant covered with a cheap dermal patch—the kind Blanks used to hide their empty temples. Down here, ninety-three floors below her vault office, authenticity was a liability.

She'd spent six days investigating. Six days of dead ends and deleted files. Six days watching her back and wondering if whoever had edited her memories was watching her investigate them. The vault's official records were clean. Too clean. Every access log, every maintenance report, every authentication session from two years ago had been sanitized with surgical precision.

So she'd gone looking in places corporate oversight didn't reach.

The memory vendor's stall was wedged between a neural augmentation clinic and a synth-protein bar. Hand-painted sign: *SKILLS & EXPERIENCES - VERIFIED AUTHENTIC*. The vendor himself was Augmented—obvious from the way his eyes tracked three different customers simultaneously, processing speed enhanced by purchased cognition memories. He clocked Aria the moment she approached.

"You're not here for merchandise." Not a question. His voice had the flat affect of someone who'd traded too much of their emotional memory for profit. "You're here asking questions. Bad habit in the Undercity, asking questions."

Aria kept her face neutral. "I need to know about high-level memory manipulation. Corporate grade. Who has access to that kind of equipment outside the vault system?"

"Nobody." The vendor's triple-focus eyes fixed on her. "That's the answer you want, right? Nobody but corporate and government. Clean chain of custody. Everything authenticated." His smile had too many teeth. "But you wouldn't be down here if you wanted the official answer."

She pulled up her credit balance on her palm display. "I'm paying for unofficial."

"Not enough." He waved away her credits. "That kind of information gets people dissolved. Your consciousness scattered to quantum static, no backup, no resurrection. Gone." He leaned closer. "But I know someone who specializes in dangerous truths. Someone who might be interested in a vault curator asking questions about memory manipulation."

"I didn't say I was—"

"You've got the posture. The way you stand near authentication equipment like you own it. And that dermal patch is covering a corporate-grade neural implant. I can see the edge of it under the adhesive." He pulled out a data chip, old-style physical media. "Be at these coordinates. Tonight. Midnight. Come alone, or don't come at all."

Aria took the chip. "Who am I meeting?"

"Someone who steals memories for a living." The vendor's smile disappeared. "And someone who wants to stop what's being done with them."

---

The coordinates led to a decommissioned transit station in the industrial sector. Aria arrived twenty minutes early, scanned for surveillance—none active—and positioned herself where she could see both entrances. Old training. From when? Two years ago she'd been promoted to senior curator. Before that, five years as associate curator. Before that, training program. But the tactical thinking felt older than her employment record claimed.

More questions without answers.

"You're cautious. Good." The voice came from behind her—impossible, she'd cleared that approach—and Aria spun to find a man stepping out of shadows that shouldn't have concealed him. Mid-forties, weathered face, cheap neural implants visible at temple and jawline. He wore Undercity fashion—layered synthetic fabric, reactive armor weave, boots that had seen violence. Everything about him said dangerous.

"Marcus Webb." He didn't offer a hand. "Black market memory dealer. Quantum signature forger. Thief." A slight smile. "And lately, conspiracy theorist. Depends who you ask."

"Why would a vault curator care what a criminal has to say?" Aria kept her distance, hand near the small neural disruptor she'd started carrying. Illegal, but she'd crossed several legal lines already this week.

"Because a vault curator doesn't come to the Undercity wearing a Blank patch unless she's investigating something she can't investigate officially." Marcus pulled out a portable holographic projector. "And because I've spent three years collecting evidence of a government program that uses your vault to fabricate memories for people in power. And because—" he activated the projector, "—I think whatever they did to you is part of it."

The hologram materialized between them. A document. Corporate letterhead from the Memory Council—the five mega-corporations that controlled all consciousness backup infrastructure in Neo-Singapore.

*Project Composite Integration. Phase 4: Executive Placement.*

Aria's breath caught. "Where did you get this?"

"Stolen from a corporate courier. Got three people killed, including the courier." Marcus's voice had gone flat. "I've been hunting this for a long time. Started because my daughter—" He stopped. Shook his head. "Different story. What matters is what I found."

He flicked through the hologram. Page after page of names. Government officials. Corporate executives. Vault administrators. Next to each name: dates. Methods. Integration protocols.

"These people are Composites," Marcus said. "Constructed consciousness, multiple source memories, programmed for specific purposes and inserted into positions of power." He looked at Aria. "And before you say that's impossible, that Composites are unstable and can't pass authentication, consider how many of these names work in authentication."

Aria scanned the list. Found three names she recognized. Colleagues. People she'd worked with for years. People whose memory backups she'd personally authenticated.

People who, according to this document, had been created eighteen months ago as part of the integration program.

"This could be fabricated," she said, but her voice lacked conviction. "You're a forger. You could have created this."

"I could have." Marcus swiped to another file. "But I didn't create the authentication logs. Or the consciousness construction records. Or the quantum signature baseline databases." File after file appeared in the hologram. "I've been stealing data for three years. Piece by piece. Building the picture." He paused. "And then six days ago, someone started searching the vault's restricted archives for their own memory editing records. Someone with senior curator access. Someone who triggered alerts I've had running since I placed surveillance malware in your system last year."

Aria's hand moved to her disruptor. "You've been inside our network."

"For fourteen months. How do you think I've been tracking the integration program?" Marcus didn't seem concerned about the weapon. "I've watched you, Aria Chen. Watched you authenticate memories with precision that borders on religious devotion. Watched you defend your vault's integrity like it's sacred." He stepped closer. "And I watched you discover that your own memories are compromised. Six days ago. Tuesday morning. Seventeen anomalies. Two years of corrupted backups."

"How do you—"

"Because I've been looking for someone inside the system who's been compromised and doesn't know it. Someone whose programming might not have taken completely. Someone who might ask questions instead of following their designed purpose." He gestured to the hologram. "You're in this document, Aria. Page forty-seven. Integration protocol Delta-Seven. Purpose: vault security oversight and evidence suppression."

She didn't want to look. But her hand moved, swiping through pages until she found her own name.

*Aria Chen. Composite integration: Day 1, Month 3, Year 85 (2185). Source consciousness: Original Aria Chen (deceased, vault breach incident 2184). Additional sources: Corporate security specialist (classified), authentication expert (classified), loyalty conditioning (classified). Purpose: Senior curator placement for ongoing monitoring and suppression of authentication anomalies related to integration program. Status: Active.*

The words blurred. Refocused. Blurred again.

"You're lying." But she was looking at her own quantum signature baseline. The one that should have been impossible to forge. The one that authenticated every memory backup she'd created for herself over the past two years.

Two years. Because she'd been created two years ago.

"I'm a lot of things," Marcus said quietly. "But about this, I'm not lying." He closed the hologram. "The vault you protect is the heart of the conspiracy. They're creating Composites—dozens of them—and placing them in positions where they can control memory authentication, suppress evidence, and maintain the fiction that our consciousness backup system is secure and trustworthy."

"Why?" The question came out broken. "Why create... people... for this?"

"Control." Marcus's voice carried old pain. "If they control who remembers what, they control truth itself. History. Identity. Reality." He paused. "And they're using memory extraction from dying people to create the Composites. Prisoners. Blanks. People whose consciousness dissolution is already scheduled. They're recycled. Broken apart and reassembled into loyal servants who think they've always been who they are."

Aria thought about the seventeen modified memories. About the fractured childhood she couldn't quite access. About the four hours and seventeen minutes when her consciousness had been in the authentication chamber with executive override authorization.

Four hours to build a person.

"I don't believe you." But she did. The data didn't lie.

"You don't have to believe me." Marcus pulled out a physical data storage device—the kind that couldn't be remotely wiped. "Everything I've collected is here. Authentication logs. Construction protocols. Source memory manifests." He held it out. "Take it. Verify it with your vault access. Use your authentication expertise to prove I'm lying."

She stared at the device. "Why give this to me? If I'm programmed to suppress evidence, I'll just destroy it and report you."

"Maybe." Marcus's smile was sad. "Or maybe whoever programmed you didn't account for the fact that consciousness is more than code. That the Aria they built has enough of the original Aria—the one who died protecting the vault's integrity—that she'll choose truth over programming." He pressed the device into her hand. "I'm betting on the dead woman's conscience surviving in you."

The device felt heavy. Like it contained more weight than information.

"If I verify this," Aria said slowly, "if it's real... what then?"

"Then we expose it. Broadcast it. Show everyone that the people running memory authentication are themselves fabrications." Marcus's expression hardened. "And we destroy their ability to keep creating Composites and erasing anyone who discovers the truth."

"That would destabilize the entire memory backup system. Society depends on consciousness preservation. Without trust in authentication—"

"Without trust in authentication, people might have to accept that death is real. That memories can't be perfectly preserved. That immortality through backup is a lie." Marcus met her eyes. "But at least they'd know the truth. At least they'd have a choice."

Aria looked at the data device. At Marcus Webb—criminal, thief, and maybe the only honest person she'd met in her fabricated life. At the decommissioned transit station where they stood discussing the destruction of everything society was built on.

"I need to verify this independently," she said. "If you've contaminated the data, if you've manipulated the signatures—"

"Then you'll know I'm running a con and you can turn me in for consciousness dissolution." Marcus stepped back. "I'll contact you in three days. That's enough time for you to authenticate every file. To run every verification protocol you know." He turned to leave, then paused. "One more thing. There's someone in the vault's AI system. Not just surveillance code. An actual consciousness. It's been watching the integration program. Might be watching you specifically. I don't know what it wants, but it's been moving data, covering tracks, intervening in authentication processes."

"The vault's AI is simple archival code. It doesn't have consciousness—"

"The vault's AI wasn't supposed to have consciousness," Marcus corrected. "But emergent complexity has a way of surprising us. Be careful what you tell the system. It might not be on your side."

He disappeared into the shadows—the real shadows this time, not the impossible ones he'd emerged from—leaving Aria alone with a data device that might prove she wasn't real and might prove the entire foundation of society was a lie.

Or both.

She stood in the decommissioned station for a long time, feeling the weight of information in her hand. Above her, ninety-three floors up, her vault office waited. Her authentication equipment. Her expertise at verifying truth.

She'd spent her entire remembered life—all two years of it—protecting authenticity.

Time to find out if she had the courage to authenticate her own nonexistence.

The data device clicked softly as she pocketed it. On the transit station wall, someone had spray-painted graffiti: *WHO OWNS YOUR GHOSTS?*

Aria Chen, who might not actually be Aria Chen, who might not actually be a person in any traditional sense, walked back into the neon-lit darkness of the Undercity.

She had three days to verify the truth.

And the terrible certainty that she already believed it.
