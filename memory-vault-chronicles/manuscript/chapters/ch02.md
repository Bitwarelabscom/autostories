# Chapter 2: The Digital Ghost

The archived logs were too clean.

Aria had been searching for three hours—since her shift ended and the vault's evening crew took over—digging through maintenance records, access logs, authentication sessions. Two years ago. The time when someone had edited her memories. When someone had turned her into whatever she was.

But every file she pulled showed nothing. Perfect documentation. Routine maintenance. Standard procedures. Not a single irregularity in the records from that night.

Which was itself irregular. Nothing was ever perfect in vault operations. There were always minor discrepancies. Equipment glitches. Timing variations. Human error in documentation.

Not this time. These logs read like they'd been written by someone who'd never made a mistake. Or someone who'd gone back and removed every mistake after the fact.

"You're still here." The voice made her jump. Aria closed the search window and turned to find Chen Park—no relation despite sharing her last name—standing in the archive room doorway. Associate curator. One of the colleagues whose memory backup she'd authenticated a hundred times.

"Catching up on documentation," Aria said. The lie came easily. Too easily. Was that her personality or someone's programming? "Had some backlogs from the quarterly reviews."

Chen Park smiled, but his eyes tracked to her terminal screen before it had fully cleared. "Quarterly reviews were last month. And you're never behind on documentation. You're the most precise curator on this floor." He stepped inside. "What are you really looking for?"

Aria's hand moved to her desk drawer, where she'd started keeping the illegal neural disruptor. Old training surfacing. Training she couldn't remember learning. "Just being thorough."

"About maintenance logs from two years ago?" Chen Park's smile didn't waver, but something in his tone shifted. "That's not thoroughness. That's investigation." He moved closer. "And investigating your own vault suggests you've found something that concerns you."

"I haven't found anything." True statement. Nothing to find because someone had scrubbed it clean.

"Then why are you looking?" Chen Park settled into the chair across from her desk. Casual. Friendly. The way he always was. They'd worked together for—how long? Her memories said four years. But she only had reliable memories going back two. So maybe they'd worked together for two years. Or maybe Chen Park was another fabrication. Another Composite placed to watch her.

"Can I ask you something?" Aria kept her voice professional. "When did we meet? First day. Do you remember it?"

Chen Park's expression flickered. "Why would you—"

"Humor me."

He was quiet for a moment. Then: "Staff orientation. Six years ago. You were transferring from the authentication training program. I was already working archives." He tilted his head. "Why?"

"Do you remember what we talked about?"

"Memory standards. You were concerned about degradation rates in transferred consciousness. You wanted to implement stricter verification protocols." Chen Park's smile returned, warmer this time. "You've always cared too much about authenticity. It's what makes you good at this job."

The details were right. Too right. The kind of perfect recall that came from either truth or carefully constructed fiction.

"What aren't you telling me?" Chen Park asked. "I've noticed you've been distracted all week. Ever since the mandatory self-audit. Did something flag in your backup?"

Aria studied him. Trying to read whether his concern was genuine or surveillance. Whether he was colleague or conspirator. Whether he even knew which one he was.

"If something did flag," she said carefully, "and if that something suggested the vault's authentication system had been compromised at some point, what would you do?"

Chen Park's expression went very still. "I'd report it immediately. Through proper channels. To our supervisor." He leaned forward. "Aria, if you've discovered a security breach, you need to follow protocol. Not investigate on your own. You know what happens to people who try to handle vault security issues independently."

"Consciousness dissolution," Aria said. "For anyone who compromises the integrity of the memory backup system."

"Exactly." Chen Park stood. "So whatever you're looking for in those logs, whatever you think you've found—bring it to Director Kauffman. Let her handle it. That's what she's there for."

Director Sarah Kauffman. Aria's supervisor. The person she reported to every day. The person whose name appeared in her employment records going back—how long? Eight years according to the files. Two years according to her reliable memory.

The person who might have authorized editing Aria's consciousness.

"I'll think about it," Aria said.

"Don't think too long." Chen Park moved toward the door, then paused. "The vault protects us, Aria. But only if we protect it. Following protocol isn't just bureaucracy. It's how we stay alive." He left without waiting for a response.

Aria sat alone in the archive room, listening to the environmental systems breathe. Chen Park had given her advice. Genuine concern or subtle warning? Impossible to tell.

She pulled up his employee file. Hired seven years ago. Promoted three years ago. Exemplary record. Standard background check. Nothing suspicious.

She pulled up his memory backup history. Archives every six months, as required. Fifteen backups total, dating back seven years.

She loaded his most recent backup into the authentication scanner. Ran a basic verification. Clean quantum signatures. No manipulation detected. Original consciousness, unmodified.

Either he was real, or whoever had created him had done a better job than with her.

Aria closed the files and stood. Her terminal showed the search history she'd accumulated over three hours. Hundreds of queries. All leading nowhere. All showing records that were too perfect to be real.

Someone had cleaned the vault's logs. Someone with high-level access and the technical skill to do it without leaving traces. Someone who'd done it recently enough that they could still be watching for anyone who looked too close.

Someone who might already know she was searching.

Aria cleared her search history. Shut down her terminal. Gathered her things.

As she left the archive room, her neural implant chimed. Message from Director Kauffman.

*Please see me tomorrow morning. 0800. Regarding your self-audit results.*

Aria stopped walking. Read the message again. Kauffman wanted to discuss her self-audit. The one where Aria had reported no anomalies. The lie she'd committed to corporate record.

Either this was routine follow-up, or someone had noticed her investigation.

Either Kauffman wanted clarification on legitimate results, or she knew Aria had discovered something and concealed it.

Either tomorrow morning would be a normal administrative meeting, or it would be the beginning of the end.

Aria deleted the message. Kept walking. Her hand brushed the neural disruptor in her jacket pocket. Illegal weapon. Proof of paranoia. Or proof of appropriate caution in a world where her own memories couldn't be trusted.

The vault's corridors were quiet at this hour. Just environmental systems and the hum of consciousness storage matrices. Millions of backed-up minds, preserved in quantum suspension. Trusting that the authentication system worked. Trusting that their memories would stay theirs.

Trusting people like Aria to keep them safe.

People like Aria, who couldn't even keep her own memories safe.

She reached the elevator. Pressed the button for ground level. Watched the floors tick down. Ninety-three levels from archive room to street. Ninety-three levels from the truth she was looking for to the lies waiting outside.

The elevator doors opened on Level 42. Someone got in. Corporate uniform. Neural implant visible at temple. They nodded to Aria. Professional courtesy.

She nodded back. Watched them in the elevator's reflective surface. Checking if they were watching her.

They weren't. Just another vault employee heading home. Just another person whose consciousness might or might not be their own. Just another potential Composite, unaware they were constructed.

Just like Aria had been, until she'd run that self-audit.

The elevator reached ground level. Aria stepped out into Neo-Singapore's evening neon. The city spread before her in layers of light and shadow. Millions of people. How many of them were real? How many were fabrications, walking around thinking they were authentic?

How many knew the truth and kept it hidden?

Aria pulled up her calendar. Tomorrow. 0800. Meeting with Kauffman. Decision point.

Tell the truth about what she'd found. Follow protocol. Trust the system.

Or continue investigating on her own. Break every rule she'd ever followed. Risk everything to find answers that might prove she was nothing.

The neon lights reflected in the vault's windows behind her. The building where she worked. Where she'd supposedly worked for eight years. Where someone had edited her consciousness and made her forget.

Aria looked at it for a long moment.

Then she pulled out her terminal and started searching for black market contacts in the Undercity. For people who operated outside corporate oversight. For criminals who might know what happened when vault employees discovered too much.

For anyone who could help her find the truth before tomorrow's meeting decided whether she was allowed to keep looking.

The neon painted her in shades of pink and blue. Same colors as the sunrise in her office window that morning. Morning when she'd still believed she knew who she was.

That was twelve hours ago.

It felt like a lifetime.

Maybe because in a very real sense, her previous lifetime had ended two years ago, when someone had edited her into existence.

And her new lifetime—the one where she knew something was wrong—had started this morning with a quantum signature anomaly.

Aria Chen, age uncertain, memories unreliable, identity questionable, walked into the neon-lit evening searching for black market criminals who might be more trustworthy than her own supervisor.

The vault hummed its authentication protocols behind her.

She didn't look back.
