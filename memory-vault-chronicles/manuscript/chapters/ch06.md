# Chapter 6: The Day Before

Day 6. Saturday. The vault was always quieter on weekends. Skeleton crew. Minimal oversight. Perfect time for someone to disappear into restricted archives without raising questions.

Perfect time for Aria to make one last search before everything changed.

She'd told herself she wouldn't go back. Wouldn't risk it. Would wait for tonight's meeting with Marcus Webb and make decisions based on what he revealed.

But at 0600 she found herself standing outside the vault anyway. Her credentials still worked. Security nodded her through. No questions about her extended personal leave. Either Kauffman's authorization was legitimate, or no one cared enough to verify.

The archive room on Level 93 was empty. Just her and the consciousness storage matrices humming their preservation protocols. Five million minds backed up and waiting. Trusting the system. Trusting people like Aria to keep them safe.

People like Aria, who might not be people at all.

She pulled up the vault's personnel files. Not the official ones. The deep records. The ones that showed when consciousness backups were actually created versus when employment records claimed.

Chen Park: Backup history matches employment. Seven years. Consistent. Original.

Associate Curator Williams: Backup history matches. Twelve years. Consistent. Original.

Senior Curator Martinez: Backup history starts four years ago. Employment record claims eight years. Discrepancy. Possible Composite.

She ran the analysis across all vault personnel. Forty-three employees. Eight showed discrepancies between backup history and employment records. Eight possible Composites placed in key positions.

Including her.

Including Director Kauffman.

Kauffman's backup history started twelve years ago. Perfect match with her claimed employment. But the quantum signatures on her oldest backups showed integration markers. Subtle. Almost invisible. The kind only someone with Aria's expertise would detect.

Kauffman was Composite. Had been for twelve years. Longer than almost anyone else in the vault.

Which meant the conversation they'd had—the recruitment, the shared investigation, the data chip with evidence—all of it came from someone who was part of the conspiracy. Someone created to manage it.

Or someone created to run it who'd gone independent. Who'd exceeded their programming the same way Aria was exceeding hers.

No way to know. No way to verify.

Aria downloaded the personnel analysis. Encrypted it. Prepared to bring it to Marcus tonight as evidence.

Then she saw the security alert.

Someone else accessing the same files. Same timestamp. Same query parameters.

Someone mirroring her search in real-time.

She pulled the source. Authorization code: Director Sarah Kauffman.

Either Kauffman was checking what Aria was looking for, or someone was using Kauffman's credentials to monitor Aria's investigation.

Or the system was designed to alert supervisors when employees accessed restricted files, and Kauffman was simply doing her job.

Three possibilities. No way to determine which.

Aria closed the search. Cleared her history. Left the archive room.

In the hallway, she nearly collided with Chen Park.

"Aria." He looked surprised. Concerned. "Thought you were on leave. Family emergency?"

"Needed to check something for work. Couldn't wait."

Chen Park studied her face. "You look exhausted. When's the last time you slept?"

"I'm fine."

"You're not." He moved closer, lowering his voice. "I've known you four years. You've never looked like this. Stressed, paranoid, checking over your shoulder." He paused. "Whatever's going on, you can tell me. We're colleagues. Friends. I can help."

Were they friends? Aria's memories said yes. But memories could be fabricated. Friendships could be programmed. Everything could be designed to make her feel supported while actually surveilling her.

"There's nothing going on," she said.

"Then why are you in the vault on Saturday when you're supposed to be on personal leave? Why are you accessing restricted personnel files? Why do you keep looking at me like you're trying to determine if I'm real?"

Because she was. Because she'd been doing authentication analysis on every person she encountered. Because trust was impossible when existence itself was questionable.

"I have to go," Aria said.

"Wait." Chen Park pulled out his terminal. "I was going to message you this, but since you're here... Director Kauffman asked me to give you something. Said you'd understand."

He transferred a file to Aria's device. Small. Encrypted. Timestamp from ten minutes ago.

Right after Kauffman had detected Aria's restricted file access.

"What is it?" Aria asked.

"Don't know. Above my clearance." Chen Park smiled, but worry showed in his eyes. "Are you in trouble? Because if you need help—"

"I'm fine." Aria pocketed her terminal. "Thank you for the file."

She left before he could ask more questions. Before she had to lie more convincingly. Before her paranoia made her run authentication on a colleague who'd shown nothing but genuine concern.

Outside the vault, she opened Kauffman's file.

A single line of text: *They know you're investigating. Meeting tonight is compromised. Dead-drop location Beta-7 has alternative coordinates. Use those instead. - K*

Aria pulled up the dead-drop protocols Kauffman had shown her. Located Beta-7. Found a physical data chip waiting in a maintenance shaft on Level 42.

The chip contained new coordinates. Different transit station. Different time. 2300 instead of midnight.

Which meant either Kauffman was protecting her from a trap, or Kauffman was redirecting her into a different trap.

Either the original midnight coordinates from Marcus were compromised, or Kauffman was trying to prevent Aria from meeting him.

Either way, Aria had two sets of coordinates now. Two potential meetings. Two choices.

She checked her terminal. 0800. Fifteen hours until the Kauffman meeting. Sixteen hours until the Marcus meeting.

Enough time to prepare for either. Or both. Or neither.

Enough time to disappear completely if she wanted. Leave Neo-Singapore. Abandon the investigation. Accept that she was Composite and live with the comfortable lie.

But Aria knew she wouldn't. The investigation wasn't programming. The need to know wasn't designed behavior. Whatever she was—malfunctioning Composite or authentic consciousness—the choice to seek truth was the only thing that felt entirely hers.

She went home. Packed essentials. Neural disruptor. Both data chips. The personnel analysis. Encrypted copies of everything she'd discovered.

Wrote a message to Chen Park: *If I disappear, check the dead-drop protocols. Everything I found is there. Tell whoever you trust. Make sure the truth gets out.*

She scheduled it to send tomorrow at noon. Insurance. Legacy. Proof she'd existed even if she didn't survive.

The afternoon passed. Aria tried to sleep. Couldn't. Tried to eat. Couldn't. Tried to think of anything except the meetings waiting in darkness.

Couldn't.

At 2000, her terminal chimed. Message from Marcus.

*Kauffman gave you alternative coordinates. Don't trust them. She's part of the conspiracy. Come to original location. Midnight. I'll prove everything.*

At 2015, message from Kauffman.

*Marcus Webb is manipulating you. His evidence is fabricated. Come to Beta-7 location. 2300. I'll prove everything.*

Two messages. Two claims. Two people calling the other compromised.

Both could be lying. Both could be telling truth. Both could be pawns in a larger game neither understood.

Aria sat in her apartment watching the sun set on Neo-Singapore. Neon lights flickering on. The city transforming from day lies to night lies. Same lies. Different illumination.

At 2100, she left her apartment.

At 2200, she took a transport to the industrial sector.

At 2245, she stood between two locations. Kauffman's coordinates five blocks west. Marcus's coordinates three blocks east.

She had fifteen minutes to decide.

Go west to Kauffman at 2300. Trust her supervisor. Trust the system. Trust that there were good people inside the conspiracy trying to fix it.

Go east to Marcus at midnight. Trust a criminal. Trust the black market. Trust that outsiders had clearer truth than insiders.

Or go neither direction. Walk away. Disappear into the Undercity. Become someone new. Let the conspiracy burn without her.

The city hummed around her. Millions of people living in the memory economy. Buying and selling consciousness. Trusting that their backups would preserve them. Trusting that authentication worked. Trusting that people in power were real.

Trusting lies.

Aria made her choice.

She started walking.

The neon lights painted her path in shades of question and answer.

In shades of truth and fabrication.

In shades of who she'd been and who she was choosing to become.

The vault hummed in the distance.

She didn't look back.

Because whatever happened in the next hour would prove whether she was real enough to matter.

Whether consciousness constructed from pieces could still make authentic choices.

Whether Aria Chen—Composite or corrupted or something impossibly between—could choose truth over safety and survive what came next.

The city breathed.

Aria walked.

And in the darkness ahead, someone waited with answers.

Or lies.

Or something more terrifying than either.

The truth.
