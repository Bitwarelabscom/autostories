# Chapter 13: Planning Destruction

Day 11. The day after discovering she was Composite. The day after committing to exposure. The day Marcus Webb taught her how to break into the vault she'd spent two years protecting.

They met in an abandoned warehouse. Industrial sector. Level -5. Deep enough that corporate surveillance didn't bother. Close enough to surface that escape routes existed.

Marcus had brought equipment. Technical specs. Schematics. Three years of stolen intel about vault security systems.

"The restricted archive is here." He projected a hologram. Vault Level 47. "Maximum security. Biometric locks. Quantum encryption. Neural signature verification at every checkpoint."

"I know. I've worked there." Aria studied the layout. "These schematics are two years old. They've upgraded since."

"How much?"

"Enough to make your plan inadequate." She pulled up current security protocols from her access. "Three additional checkpoints. Rotating quantum keys. Real-time authentication validation."

Marcus grinned. "That's why I need you. You have current access. Current knowledge. You can walk us through like legitimate maintenance."

"Us?"

"You and me. Two-person operation. You handle authentication. I handle technical bypass for anything your credentials can't access." He pulled equipment from bags. "Consciousness extraction rig. Portable. Military spec. Can copy terabytes in thirty minutes."

"Where did you get military equipment?"

"Black market has its advantages. Someone steals from corporate. Someone sells to me. Circle of life." Marcus assembled the rig. "This will copy everything in the restricted archive. Every Composite creation record. Every integration protocol. Every authorization chain. Everything we need to prove the conspiracy."

Aria examined the equipment. "It won't pass security scans. They'll detect it."

"Not if we hide it in legitimate equipment. I've got a clean extraction rig we'll show guards. This one goes in quantum-shielded pocket." He demonstrated. "Sensors can't penetrate the shielding."

"That's illegal."

Marcus laughed. "We're planning to break into a classified vault, steal government secrets, and broadcast proof of systematic consciousness manipulation. Illegal equipment is the least of our crimes."

He was right. They were past laws. Past protocol. Past everything except the choice to reveal truth regardless of cost.

"When?" Aria asked.

"Seven days. Gives us time to prepare. To practice. To make sure we can execute without getting killed." Marcus pulled up a timeline. "Day 17. Night shift. Minimal personnel. Maximum opportunity."

"Why night?"

"Because Dr. Tanaka—The Archivist—has less active presence during low-traffic hours. Her processing is distributed across vault operations. Night shift means fewer simultaneous tasks. Means she's less likely to notice our intrusion until we're already extracting data."

Aria studied the plan. The timing. The equipment. The risks.

"If she notices us, she'll seal the vault. Trap us inside. Dissolve our consciousness."

"Yes." Marcus met her eyes. "This is suicide mission with optimistic technical specifications. We probably die. The question is whether dying matters if we get the broadcast out first."

"You're willing to die for this?"

"I've been willing to die since my daughter's consciousness was sold to pay my debts. Since I realized the system I participated in was destroying people. Since I understood that someone had to stop it even if stopping it meant ending." He paused. "You deleted your backup. You're already committed to dying if this fails. I'm just catching up."

They spent hours refining the plan. Entry protocols. Checkpoint timing. Data extraction procedures. Escape routes if things went wrong. Broadcast activation if they couldn't escape.

Aria showed him vault layouts. Current authentication procedures. Guard rotation schedules. Everything she knew from two years inside.

Everything she'd been created to protect.

Now she was weaponizing it. Using her designed purpose to destroy what she was built to preserve.

Either profound malfunction or profound free will.

No way to know which.

"There's something else," Marcus said. "Your supervisor. Director Kauffman. She's going to notice you missing. Going to investigate. We need to handle her."

"Handle how?"

"Incapacitate. Detain. Something that keeps her from interfering without killing her." Marcus pulled up Kauffman's schedule. "She'll be in her office Day 17. Standard evening work. We could lock her in. Cut communications. Keep her contained until after the broadcast."

Aria shook her head. "She's Composite. Twelve years of integration. She might be part of Tanaka's plan."

"Or she might be like you. Created for purpose but thinking independently. You don't know which."

"Exactly. Can't trust her. Can't risk her stopping us."

"So what do we do?"

Aria considered. "We don't tell her. We don't involve her. If she's loyal to Tanaka, we avoid alerting the enemy. If she's independent, we protect her from consequences. Either way, she stays out of it."

Marcus nodded. "Isolation strategy. Smart. We go in alone. Extract alone. Broadcast alone. No one else gets implicated."

"No one else can betray us."

"That too."

They packed the equipment. Encrypted the plans. Set up dead-drop coordination for the next six days.

"One more thing," Marcus said. "Your colleague. Chen Park. He's been asking about you. Concerned. He might investigate if you disappear for a week."

"I'll message him. Family emergency. Extended leave. Something plausible."

"Will he buy it?"

"Doesn't matter. By Day 17, truth goes public. Whether he believes my excuse until then is irrelevant." Aria paused. "Though if we die in the attempt, he'll find the insurance message I left him. He'll know what happened."

They separated. Different exits. Different routes home. No surveillance trail connecting them.

Aria walked through Undercity back to her apartment. Day 11. Six days until the vault breach. Six days to prepare for death or transcendence or whatever came after choosing truth over safety.

Her terminal chimed. Kauffman.

*Haven't heard from you in days. Concerned. Are you safe? Can we talk? -K*

Aria deleted the message. Kauffman represented everything uncertain. Potential ally. Potential enemy. Potential both simultaneously.

Better to exclude her. Better to move forward without variables she couldn't verify.

Another message. Unknown sender.

*We know you are planning something. We know Marcus Webb is involved. We know you believe you have six days. You do not. We will move against you sooner. The timeline has accelerated. Be ready.* - The Archivist / Dr. Tanaka

Aria stopped breathing.

Tanaka knew. Knew about the plan. Knew about Marcus. Knew they had days.

And she was moving the timeline up.

Aria sent emergency message to Marcus. *She knows. Timeline compromised. We move sooner.*

Response immediate. *How soon?*

*As soon as we're ready. Three days maximum. Day 14.*

*That's not enough prep time.*

*It's what we have. Either we move fast or she moves first.*

Pause. Then: *Day 14. Night shift. We'll make it work.*

Aria looked out at Neo-Singapore. Neon lights painting the city in colors of question and answer. Colors of truth and lies. Colors of authentic versus constructed.

Day 11. Three days to prepare. Three days to finalize the plan that would expose everything or kill them trying.

Three days until she proved whether consciousness built from pieces could still make choices that mattered.

Whether being real enough was the same as being real.

The vault hummed in the distance.

The Archivist watched.

And the clock counted down.
