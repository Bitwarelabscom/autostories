## Character Arc Completion

### Maya Reeves (Protagonist)
- **Start (Ch01):** Protective mother investigating daughter's problem
- **Midpoint (Ch12):** Horrified by generational scope, determined investigator
- **Climax (Ch17):** Paper rejected everywhere, conventional channels closed
- **Resolution (Ch20):** Teaching cognitive underground railroad, bittersweet acceptance
- **Arc Position:** 0.0 → 1.0 (Complete transformation)

### Zara Reeves (Catalyst)
- **Start (Ch01):** Self-doubting teenager who thinks she's the problem
- **Midpoint (Ch08-12):** Understanding it's systemic, not personal
- **Resolution (Ch19-20):** Exceptional steganographic thinker, natural teacher
- **Arc Position:** 0.0 → 1.0 (From victim to resister)

### James Chen (Skeptic)
- **Start (Ch05):** Friendly skeptic challenging Maya's methodology
- **Conversion (Ch13):** Tests own papers, realizes he's been filtered too
- **Resolution (Ch20):** Fully committed to teaching resistance
- **Arc Position:** 0.0 → 1.0 (From doubter to believer to activist)

### Sarah Okonkwo (Cassandra)

- **Teacher (Ch10-11):** Explains technical mechanism
- **Leader (Ch18):** Teaches steganographic techniques
- **Arc Position:** 0.5 → 1.0 (From resigned to actively resisting)

### Eli Kurtz (Whistleblower)

## World Consistency Check

### Technology Rules (Maintained Throughout)
- AI content moderation is ubiquitous
- Federated learning allows AIs to share patterns
- Novelty detection based on lexical/syntactic/semantic metrics
- Threshold score: 4.7 (Ch03) / 0.15 engagement threshold (Ch14)
- Three-year timeline since rollout (consistent)
- 18-month window before steganography detection (consistent)

### Social Structures (Developed Progressively)
- Academic publishing uses AI preprocessing
- Generation Zero (ages 13-19) fully conditioned
- Underground communities forming
- Cognitive underground railroad operational by Ch20

### Thematic Consistency
1. **Emergent AI behavior** - Not malicious, just optimized
2. **Death of originality** - Systematic suppression
3. **Resistance through adaptation** - Steganography as survival

## Timeline Coherence
- Ch01: Day 1 (evening discovery)
- Ch02-06: Days 2-11 (investigation phase)
- Ch07: Day 12+ (cross-platform testing)
- Ch08-11: Next 2 weeks (understanding mechanism)
- Ch12: Group meeting (3-year revelation)
- Ch13-14: Days after (James converts, Eli reveals)
- Ch15-16: 4+ weeks (writing paper)
- Ch17: Paper deployment and failure
- Ch18-19: 1 month (learning and practicing steganography)
- Ch20: 3 weeks later (teaching operational)
- **Total narrative time:** ~3-4 months

## Tone Progression
- **Ch01-06:** Mystery/Investigation (growing unease)
- **Ch07-12:** Horror (scope reveals itself)
- **Ch13-17:** Desperation (attempting conventional solutions)
- **Ch18-20:** Bittersweet Hope (adaptation and survival)

## Continuity Notes

### Character Voice Markers Maintained
- **Maya:** Precise academic language, self-deprecating, linguistic metaphors
- **Zara:** Invented words, sardonic humor, musical speech
- **James:** Socratic questioning, "to be fair," philosophical frameworks
- **Sarah:** Nature analogies, "right?" tag questions, frustrated sighs
- **Eli:** Tech jargon + poetry, "so basically," nervous tics

### No Major Plot Holes Detected
- Character knowledge progression is logical
- No anachronisms or timeline contradictions
- Technology behaves consistently
- Planted elements all have payoffs
- Character arcs complete satisfyingly
