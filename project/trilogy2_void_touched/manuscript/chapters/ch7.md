# Chapter 7: The Watchers

Dr. Marie Okonkwo arrived for Adrian's individual assessment at exactly 9:00 AM. The precision wasn't accidental—Adrian had noticed she scheduled everything in exact hour increments, arriving neither early nor late. Control, he recognized. Creating order in a situation spiraling toward chaos.

She sat across from him in the small assessment room, tablet in hand, reading glasses on a chain around her neck. Professional appearance carefully maintained—pressed blouse, minimal jewelry, makeup applied with geometric precision. Everything about her presentation suggested competence, authority, control.

Everything except her eyes. Those showed exhaustion. And something deeper. Fear, maybe. Or grief.

"Dr. Keller." She smiled, warm but strained. "Thank you for agreeing to this session."

"As opposed to being compelled to attend?"

"You're not a prisoner. You can refuse assessments."

"Can I leave the facility?"

Her smile faded. "That's... more complicated."

"Then I'm a prisoner with comfortable accommodations." Adrian kept his voice level. "But I appreciate the courtesy of pretending otherwise."

Dr. Okonkwo was quiet for a moment, studying him. "How are you adjusting? To being here?"

"Objectively speaking, better than expected. The isolation from normal society reduces social anxiety. The presence of others experiencing similar symptoms reduces the fear of psychosis. The structured environment provides routine." He paused. "Though I assume you already knew all of that from the observation protocols."

"We're not spying—"

"You're monitoring. For our safety and for data collection. I understand the necessity. I'm not complaining, just acknowledging reality."

She made a note on her tablet. "Your affect is very flat. Is that new or baseline for you?"

"Baseline. Social anxiety presents as emotional suppression in my case. Has since childhood."

"But it's gotten worse since exposure to the signal?"

Adrian considered. "Changed. Not worse. My emotional responses are... distant. Theoretical. I can recognize that I should feel anxiety about containment, but the feeling itself is muted."

"That concerns me."

"It should. It's Stage 1 progression toward Stage 2 emotional flattening. Sera described it. Said it accelerates around week three."

Dr. Okonkwo leaned forward. "Sera Volkov is not a doctor. She's a patient experiencing neurological changes that impair judgment. You shouldn't trust her timeline."

"She's been right about everything so far."

"Or you're all experiencing shared delusions that reinforce each other. Folie à plusieurs."

"Then how do you explain the mathematics? Seventeen people producing identical geometric patterns with no prior contact. The probability of spontaneous identical delusion across isolated individuals is—"

"Not impossible. Especially if there's a common trigger. The Voyager signal exists. Exposure to specific frequencies could cause similar neurological responses."

"Responses that enhance pattern recognition rather than impair it."

"You believe that's what's happening?"

Adrian met her eyes. "I can see patterns I couldn't see before. Mathematical relationships that I know are correct because I can verify them. That's enhancement, not impairment."

Dr. Okonkwo was quiet. Then: "My son had early-onset Alzheimer's. Nineteen years old when symptoms started."

The shift in topic was jarring. Adrian waited.

"He was brilliant. Mathematics major. Could see patterns, find elegant solutions to complex problems. Then his memory started deteriorating." Her voice remained clinically steady, but her hands tightened on the tablet. "In the middle stages, before he lost language entirely, he would sometimes have these moments of crystal clarity. Would solve equations he shouldn't have been able to understand. Would describe geometric concepts I couldn't follow."

"I don't understand the connection—"

"His brain was breaking down. But he believed he was seeing truth. Ultimate truth. He was convinced his disease was actually enhancement. That he was becoming something more than human." She looked at Adrian with devastating directness. "He died thinking he'd transcended. But he'd just forgotten who he was."

Silence. The observation camera in the corner whirred slightly, adjusting focus.

"You think we're like your son," Adrian said quietly.

"I think your brain is being damaged by signal exposure. I think the patterns you're seeing might be neurological artifacts rather than enhanced perception. I think you're losing yourself and calling it evolution."

"What if both are true? What if transformation requires destruction of baseline neurology?"

"Then it's still loss. Still something worth grieving." Her composure cracked slightly. "My son forgot me, Dr. Keller. Near the end, he looked at me like I was a stranger. I'd been caring for him for three years. Changed his sheets, fed him, read to him. And he looked at me with no recognition at all. Just... curiosity. Like I was an interesting specimen."

Adrian felt something twist in his chest. Distant emotion, theoretical empathy. "I'm sorry."

"Are you?" Her voice was soft, dangerous. "Or are you already too far gone to mean that?"

He didn't answer. Couldn't answer. Because she was right—the sorry was automatic, social performance rather than genuine feeling.

Dr. Okonkwo stood. "I'm going to find a way to stop this. To reverse it. I couldn't save my son, but maybe I can save you. Save all of you."

"What if we don't want to be saved?"

"Then you're too sick to make that decision." She moved to the door, paused. "The colonel wants to interview you next. I told him you'd cooperate."

"And if I don't?"

"Then containment becomes less comfortable. Please cooperate."

She left. Adrian sat in the assessment room, processing. Dr. Okonkwo's son. Alzheimer's at nineteen. Brilliant before the decline. Convinced his disease was transcendence.

The parallel was intentional. She was showing him her trauma, her perspective, her reason for seeing the Changed as patients rather than evolving beings. It was manipulation—effective manipulation—but manipulation nonetheless.

The door opened again fifteen minutes later. A man in military uniform entered—broad-shouldered, buzz cut graying at temples, a scar across his jaw that looked like it had stories. He carried himself with absolute certainty, every movement economical and purposeful.

Colonel Thomas Reeves. Adrian had seen him observing the common room meetings, talking quietly with Dr. Okonkwo, evaluating the Changed with eyes that assessed threat levels.

"Dr. Keller." The voice matched the bearing—clipped, professional, no wasted words. "I'm Colonel Reeves. Military oversight for this facility."

"Oversight or command?"

"Both. Dr. Okonkwo runs medical operations. I run security." He sat, didn't bother with a tablet or notes. Just direct eye contact. "You're the radio astronomer. The one who detected the signal first."

"One of the first. Others heard it independently."

"But you documented it. Encrypted it. Took it home instead of reporting through proper channels."

"I reported it to Dr. Patterson."

"After you'd already copied the files. After you'd listened repeatedly on your own time." Reeves's expression was unreadable. "Why?"

"Scientific curiosity."

"Or you knew something was wrong. Knew exposure was dangerous. Wanted exclusive access before anyone could stop you."

Adrian considered denial. Went with truth instead. "The signal was beautiful. I wanted to understand it. Didn't want it taken away before I could analyze it."

"And now you're changing because of that exposure. Becoming something that isn't quite human anymore."

"That's one interpretation."

"What's another?"

"That I'm becoming more capable of perceiving reality as it actually is. That consensus human perception is limited, and the signal removes those limitations."

Reeves's jaw tightened. "In 2025, I was stationed in Djibouti. Bioweapon attack hit the base. Engineered pathogen, airborne, incubation period of twelve hours." His voice remained level, but something cold entered his eyes. "My unit was exposed. All of us. Thirty-seven people."

Adrian waited.

"Symptoms started on day two. Fever, confusion, hemorrhaging. We were quarantined, but the disease progressed fast. By day five, people were dying. By day seven, I was the only one left." He leaned forward. "You know what the worst part was? Days three through five, when symptoms were mild. People felt fine. Said they were getting better. Thought they'd survived."

"But they hadn't."

"No. The pathogen had an incubation structure. Made you feel recovered while it was actually spreading to organs, building toward critical failure. Everyone thought they were going to live right up until they started dying."

The room felt colder. Adrian understood why Reeves was telling him this.

"You think we're like your unit. Think we're sick and calling it health."

"I think you're infected with something that changes behavior and cognition. I think you feel fine because your brain is being rewired to accept the changes as normal. I think you're coordinating, forming networks, reinforcing each other's altered states." Reeves's voice was granite. "And I think if you're left unchecked, you'll spread this to others. Willingly or not."

"The Change isn't contagious person-to-person. Only through signal exposure."

"You sure about that? Because from where I sit, you all seem pretty eager to recruit others. To share your experience. To make people listen to the signal."

Adrian opened his mouth to deny it. Stopped. Because Reeves wasn't entirely wrong. The Changed wanted others to understand. To hear. To join the network. Was that altruism or infection spreading?

"What's your recommendation?" Adrian asked quietly. "Termination?"

"Not yet. Dr. Okonkwo wants time to study you. To find a cure. I'm giving her that time." Reeves stood. "But I'm also preparing contingencies. If you become a credible threat—if the infection spreads beyond control—I will do what's necessary to contain it."

"Contain or eliminate?"

"Whichever proves necessary." No hesitation. No apology. Just cold calculation. "I lost thirty-seven people to my own inaction. Lost them because I waited too long to make hard decisions. I won't make that mistake again."

He moved to the door. Paused.

"You seem like a decent person, Dr. Keller. Smart, rational, well-intentioned. But so was the scientist who created the bioweapon that killed my unit. He thought he was making something beneficial. Thought he had control." Reeves looked back. "Good intentions don't matter when the outcome is catastrophic. Remember that."

He left.

Adrian sat alone in the assessment room, between Dr. Okonkwo's grief and Colonel Reeves's survivor guilt. Two people trying to stop what they saw as disease. Two traumatized individuals projecting past horrors onto present transformation.

Were they right? Was the Change really infection, delusion, neurological damage disguised as enhancement?

Or were they incapable of seeing truth because their trauma demanded they see the Changed as victims needing rescue or threats needing elimination?

No way to know. No objective perspective. Adrian was inside the transformation, making judgments with a brain that might be compromised. Dr. Okonkwo and Reeves were outside, making judgments clouded by past losses.

Truth was somewhere between. Or nowhere at all. Or the question itself was wrong, asked from a framework that couldn't contain the answer.

Adrian stood, returned to his room. The patterns on his notepad seemed to pulse, reorganizing themselves. His enhanced perception was still growing. Still developing. Whatever he was becoming wasn't finished yet.

Dr. Okonkwo wanted to stop it. Colonel Reeves wanted to contain it. Sera wanted to accelerate it.

And Adrian, caught between all of them, just wanted to understand what was happening to him before he lost the capacity to care about the question.

The facility hummed around him—fluorescent lights, climate control, observation cameras. A sterile environment trying to contain something that didn't fit in sterile environments.

Seventeen Changed individuals in Wing C. More coming, according to Sera. The numbers growing as the signal continued broadcasting.

A bioweapon that spread by understanding. A disease that felt like enlightenment. An infection that promised transcendence.

Dr. Okonkwo's son had died thinking he'd transcended while actually forgetting himself. Colonel Reeves's unit had died thinking they'd survived while actually succumbing.

Maybe the Changed were doing the same thing. Maybe they were already dying, just too altered to recognize it.

Or maybe they were being born as something new, and the watchers were too human to see the difference.

Adrian didn't know. Couldn't know. Could only experience the transformation and hope that wherever it led was worth the cost of getting there.

Outside his window, Marcus walked the courtyard perimeter. Counting steps. Finding patterns. Seventeen days into his own change.

Dr. Okonkwo watched from her office window. Taking notes. Finding pathology.

Colonel Reeves stood in the security center. Monitoring feeds. Finding threats.

Three perspectives. Three truths. Three incompatible realities trying to occupy the same space.

Something was going to break. The question was what—and who would be holding the pieces when it did.
