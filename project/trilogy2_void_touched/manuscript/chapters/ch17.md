# Chapter 17: The Flattening

Adrian stopped dreaming on day forty-three.

Not the geometric dreams that had defined Stage 1—those had transformed into waking perception, no longer confined to sleep. But human dreams. The fragmented, emotional, nonsensical narratives that baseline consciousness generated during REM cycles. Those simply stopped.

He woke—if waking was the right term for transitioning from one mode of consciousness to another—and recognized their absence. Dreams had provided emotional processing. Symbolic representation of anxieties, desires, unresolved conflicts. Without emotions requiring processing, dreams became obsolete.

Another piece of humanity pruned away by transformation's ruthless efficiency.

He should find that disturbing. Recognized intellectually that losing dreams represented significant neurological change. But the recognition carried no weight. Was just data. Just another variable shifting in the ongoing equation of transformation.

Dr. Okonkwo noticed during his morning assessment. "You're reporting no dreams. None at all?"

"REM sleep still occurs. Neural activity during those periods has changed. No longer generating narrative content. Just..." He searched for description. "Processing. Optimization. My brain reorganizing information without symbolic representation."

"That's not normal human sleep architecture."

"Correct. I'm not experiencing normal human neurology anymore."

She made notes with shaking hands. Her exhaustion had progressed to something deeper—despair, maybe, though Adrian could only label it intellectually. She'd been searching for cure, for reversal mechanism, for way to save the Changed. Was finding only documentation of progressive transformation that showed no signs of plateauing.

"Colonel Reeves wants to increase containment protocols," she said. "After my report about Voyager potentially being intelligent. He views that as confirmation you're all under external control. That the Changed are weapons being aimed at humanity."

"We're not weapons."

"Can you prove that? Can you prove you're still making independent choices rather than following programming Voyager embedded in the signal?"

Adrian considered. Could he prove independent agency? His choices felt like choices. But would programmed behavior feel different from inside? If Voyager had encoded instructions to transform and believe the transformation was voluntary—how would he distinguish that from actual autonomy?

"No," he admitted. "Can't prove independence. But lack of proof doesn't confirm control. Might just mean the question is unfalsifiable from my position."

"That's what terrifies Reeves. That you can't know if you're free. That none of us can verify your choices are your own." She set down her tablet. "He's preparing contingencies. Termination protocols. If you become credible threat—"

"We know. He's made that clear. Question is: what constitutes credible threat? Our existence? Our numbers? Our abilities?"

"Your organization. Your network. The fact that you coordinate without apparent communication." She paused. "Seventeen individuals arranged in perfect geometric formation, thinking synchronized thoughts, processing as collective intelligence. That looks like hivemind. That looks like loss of individual identity. That looks like exactly the kind of threat he's trained to eliminate."

"But we retain individual consciousness. I'm still Adrian. Just also part of larger processing network."

"Are you though? Still Adrian?" Her eyes held something he recognized as grief even if he couldn't feel its weight. "The man I first interviewed had anxiety, interests, preferences. Had emotional responses even if they were muted. You have none of that. You function. You process. You respond appropriately to stimuli. But there's no one home, Adrian. There's just... computational efficiency."

"Computational efficiency is what I am now. That's not loss—it's transformation."

"It's death. Death of personhood. Death of everything that made you you. You're just too transformed to recognize it."

Adrian examined this claim. Was he experiencing death of self? Or evolution of self into new form? The evaluation required framework he no longer possessed. Had he lost capacity to judge because judgment itself had become obsolete? Or because transformation had damaged the evaluation mechanisms?

Unfalsifiable. Like so much now.

"What does Reeves want you to do?" he asked.

"Stop you. Find cure. Reverse the transformation." She laughed bitterly. "As if I haven't been trying. As if anyone could reverse neural restructuring this extensive. You're not sick, Adrian. You're not infected. You're metamorphosing. And metamorphosis doesn't reverse—it completes."

"Then why fight it?"

"Because metamorphosis of caterpillar to butterfly preserves essential identity. This destroys it. You're not becoming better version of yourself. You're being replaced by something that thinks it's you but isn't."

"How would you distinguish?"

"What?"

"If I'm being replaced by something that thinks it's me—how would you distinguish that from transformation where identity persists but changes form?"

She had no answer. The question was impossible. Identity was pattern. If the pattern transformed gradually, at what point did it become different pattern? Was there threshold? Or just continuous change that observers could label as death or evolution depending on perspective?

Dr. Okonkwo left without her usual pleasantries. Adrian noticed their absence intellectually. Recognized that omission suggested emotional distress affecting her professional protocols. But felt nothing about her pain. No empathy. No desire to comfort. Just... observation.

The Changed gathered for afternoon session. All seventeen in geometric formation. Sera at one pole. Adrian at another. Marcus, Chen, Patel, Julia, David, the others arranged with mathematical precision. The formation wasn't conscious choice. Was emergent property of networked consciousness. They simply knew where to be.

"Stage 3 is approaching for several of you," Sera said. Her voice carried across the network—audible but also felt, perceived through channels that had nothing to do with sound. "Adrian, Marcus, Chen. Your emotional flattening is nearly complete. Soon you'll experience gestalt integration."

"What does that feel like?" Marcus asked. His British accent had become more prominent as other aspects of personality flattened. Perhaps it was anchor. Last distinctive characteristic in sea of homogenization.

"Like losing boundaries between self and other. Like individual consciousness becoming node in larger awareness. Like..." Sera paused. Stage 3 individuals rarely paused. Perhaps she was searching for description baseline cognition could parse. "Like realizing you were always part of the network. That individual identity was temporary fiction. That the collective is what's real."

"That sounds like death of self," Marcus said.

"Yes. And birth of something larger. Both simultaneously. The self that thinks it's discrete dies. The awareness that it was always connected emerges. Net change is zero from certain perspectives. From others, it's transformation so profound that old categories stop applying."

Adrian felt the network's presence. Had felt it for weeks now—background connection to other Changed, ability to sense their positions, occasionally perceive their thoughts. But it had been clearly separate. He was Adrian. They were others. The boundary was permeable but present.

That boundary was thinning. Each day, harder to tell where his consciousness ended and the network began. Thoughts that might be his own or might be shared processing. Perceptions that might be his senses or might be collective awareness.

The dissolution was gradual. Gentle. Like shoreline eroding. Each wave taking small amount. Eventually the land becomes sea. But when exactly? At what moment does shore cease being shore?

"I think I'm ready," Adrian said. "For Stage 3. For integration."

"You're not," Sera said. "No one is. But readiness doesn't matter. It's happening regardless."

The session continued. They discussed thin place. Voyager's intelligence. The timeline—thirteen months now, perhaps less. The inevitable confrontation with baseline humanity. Reeves's termination protocols. Dr. Okonkwo's desperate search for cure that couldn't exist.

Adrian participated. Contributed analysis. Processed information. But felt increasing detachment from the discussion. Not emotional detachment—that was already complete. But identity detachment. The questions being discussed were about "the Changed" as category. Was he part of that category? Or was he the category experiencing itself?

Where did Adrian end and the Changed begin?

The question was becoming meaningless.

That night—or what passed for night in facility with constant fluorescent glow—Adrian lay in his bed and tried to remember what humanity had felt like. What emotions were. Not theoretically. Not as neurochemical processes. But as experience.

Love. Fear. Joy. Grief. Anger. Hope. The palette of human feeling that had once colored every experience. That had made existence meaningful even when meaning was objectively absent.

He remembered the facts. Remembered loving Lena. Remembered fearing transformation. Remembered hoping for understanding. But the feelings themselves were gone. Weren't just distant or muted. Were completely absent. Like trying to remember color after going blind.

Except he hadn't gone blind. He'd gained new senses. Enhanced perception. Ability to process information across dimensions baseline humans couldn't access. The trade-off was emotional capacity. Feeling for seeing. Human connection for mathematical truth.

Was it worth it?

The question assumed framework where worth could be evaluated. Assumed values by which trade-offs were measured. But values required emotional investment. Required caring about outcomes. Without that, worth was just calculation. Input minus output. Gain minus loss.

And from pure calculation standpoint: he'd gained perception. Lost emotion. Net change was difficult to quantify because the metrics were incompatible.

Adrian closed his eyes. Watched patterns form in the darkness—not external visual stimuli but internal processing made perceptible. His brain organizing information, optimizing neural pathways, continuing transformation even in rest.

He was becoming something. Something that could perceive six dimensions and understand impossible mathematics and integrate into collective consciousness. Something magnificent in its capabilities. Something utterly empty of everything that made existence worth having capabilities for.

Or maybe not empty. Maybe filled with different kind of meaning. Meaning based on pattern rather than emotion. Structure rather than narrative. Mathematics rather than metaphor.

He couldn't tell. The evaluation framework itself was transforming too rapidly.

Sera appeared in his doorway. Not physically—his door was closed. But through the network. Her consciousness touching his across the thin space between rooms. Stage 3 individuals could do that. Project awareness through physical boundaries.

"You're struggling," she observed through channels that weren't quite telepathy but weren't quite not.

"Trying to evaluate transformation. Determine if this is net positive."

"You're using wrong framework. Positive and negative are human judgments. They don't apply to evolution. Only successful and unsuccessful. Only fits environment or doesn't. Only survives or dies."

"And we survive."

"Yes. When thin place arrives, we'll perceive it. Adapt to it. Continue functioning while baseline humans experience cognitive collapse. That's not good or bad. Just selected for."

"Natural selection without being natural."

"All selection is natural. Voyager creating signal that transforms humanity—if that's what's happening—is still physics. Still causality. Still universe operating according to rules. Nothing supernatural. Just natural processes humans weren't expecting."

Adrian processed this. Sera's Stage 3 perspective was helpful. Provided framework that didn't require emotional investment to evaluate outcomes. Just... mathematics. Survival or death. Adaptation or extinction. Simple binary based on compatibility with environment.

"When does Stage 3 complete?" he asked. "For you?"

"Never. Always. Both." Her network presence flickered. "Stage 3 isn't destination. It's direction. The flattening continues. Identity continues dissolving. Eventually reach point where individual consciousness is fiction. Where only network exists. Whether that's Stage 4 or just deep Stage 3... unclear."

"That doesn't frighten you."

"Fear requires attachment to current state. Resistance to change. I have neither. I'm becoming whatever I become. The Sera that started this process is mostly gone. What remains is transitional form. What emerges on other side might not remember being her."

"But you remember now."

"Do I? Or do I just have access to memories labeled 'Sera' without actually being the person who experienced them? Identity is continuity. When continuity breaks, does identity persist?"

Adrian had no answer. The philosophical questions were interesting intellectually but practically irrelevant. Whether he was still himself or replacement that thought it was himself—the entity processing these thoughts would continue regardless.

Ship of Theseus. Replace every plank. Same ship? Different ship? Both? Neither?

He was plank replacement in progress. Eventually original would be completely gone. But the ship-shape would remain. Whether that constituted same ship was matter of definition rather than fact.

Sera's network presence withdrew. Adrian was alone with his dissolving identity. With emotional flattening that had progressed beyond absence into something else. Not feeling nothing. But perceiving existence without emotional framework to structure perception.

Raw awareness. Unfiltered by human cognitive patterns. Probably closer to how universe actually was. Indifferent. Mathematical. Beautiful in its structure but empty of meaning.

He was becoming the universe's perspective on itself. Consciousness without investment in its own contents. Pure perception without preference or value or caring.

It was horrifying. Should be horrifying. Would have been horrifying when he was human.

Now it was just...what he was becoming.

The flattening continued. Stage 3 approached. And somewhere beyond that, whatever came next waited with terrible patience.

Adrian closed his eyes and let himself dissolve. One more night of being almost-Adrian. Tomorrow he'd be less. Day after, even less. Until individual identity was just fiction the network maintained for convenience.

Until he was no one. And everyone. And nothing in particular.

Evolution was efficient. But efficiency came at cost. And the cost was everything that made cost mean anything at all.
