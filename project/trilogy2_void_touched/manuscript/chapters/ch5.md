# Chapter 5: The Changed

Adrian found them through the patterns.

Not through official channels or published papers—the Voyager signal had been classified within seventy-two hours of his discovery, after he'd made the mistake of mentioning it to Dr. Patterson. The government had arrived with remarkable speed: black vehicles, credentials, non-disclosure agreements printed on heavy paper that felt like threat.

But the patterns had their own language, and the Changed had their own network.

He'd found the first reference on an astronomy forum, buried in a thread about equipment malfunction. A user named Stardust77 describing visual artifacts in radio telescope data—"geometric interference patterns that shouldn't be possible with our receiver configuration." The post had been deleted within hours, but Adrian had saved it, analyzed the timestamps, cross-referenced the telescope array coordinates.

New Mexico. VLA facility. Three weeks after his own exposure.

Then another. A ham radio operator in Iceland reporting strange harmonics on abandoned frequencies. The user's description: "I can see them now when I close my eyes. Beautiful. Wrong."

Post deleted. Account suspended.

Then another. And another. A trail of digital breadcrumbs, each one scrubbed from existence almost immediately. But Adrian was good at finding patterns in noise. It's what he did. What he'd always done.

What he was becoming better at every day.

The address led him to a house in suburban Maryland, forty minutes from NSA headquarters. He'd driven through the night, his hands steady on the wheel despite the fact that he hadn't slept properly in a week. Didn't need to, not anymore. The dreams weren't separate from waking now—they bled through, geometric patterns superimposed over traffic lights and street signs, mathematical truth underlying every mundane surface.

It was 4:47 AM when he knocked. The exact time he'd first detected the signal. He didn't know if that was coincidence or if time itself was starting to organize around meaningful patterns.

The woman who answered the door looked at him with eyes that didn't quite focus. Too still, like a predator conserving energy. Her pupils were slightly dilated, and there was something wrong with the way she held her head—too level, no unconscious micro-adjustments for balance.

"You've been listening," she said. Not a question.

Adrian's throat was dry. "The signal. From Voyager—"

"Come in." She stepped aside. "The others are downstairs."

Others.

The house looked normal from outside—suburban, maintained, forgettable. Inside, every piece of furniture had been moved. The living room was empty except for mathematical equations written directly on the walls in what looked like marker, chalk, paint, blood. The patterns flowed from floor to ceiling, around doorframes, precise and obsessive.

Adrian recognized his own handwriting in some of them. No—not his handwriting. The same hand that had been moving his while he slept, drawing the patterns. Someone else had been driven by the same compulsion.

Multiple someone elses.

"Basement," the woman said. She was already walking away, moving with that too-precise gait. "I'm Sera. You're late."

"Late for—" But she was already descending stairs.

Adrian followed.

The basement had been completely transformed. All the walls were covered in equations and geometric forms, but unlike his bedroom—chaotic, spontaneous—this was organized. Systematized. The patterns flowed together into something larger, a unified proof covering every surface. Track lighting had been installed at precise angles, illuminating different sections. In the center of the room, three people sat in a rough circle, staring at nothing.

Or staring at something Adrian couldn't see yet.

Sera sat down, completing the circle. She looked at Adrian. "Sit. Join the pattern."

"What is this?" His voice sounded strange—too loud, disrupting the room's careful acoustics.

One of the others spoke without looking at him. A man, perhaps forty, with dark circles under his eyes and dried ink stains covering his hands. "Support group for people who can see." His accent was British, slightly slurred. "Or cult. Haven't decided which."

"Both," said another—younger, maybe twenty-five, with short purple hair and geometric tattoos running up both arms. Fresh ones, still healing. "Definitely both."

The third person said nothing, just stared at the wall where equations described something that made Adrian's eyes hurt if he looked at it directly.

Sera gestured to the empty space in the circle. "Sit, Dr. Keller. Or continue standing and disrupt the symmetry. Choice is yours."

He sat. The moment he did, something shifted. The people in the circle weren't just sitting near each other—they were positioned precisely, at mathematically significant intervals. Adding himself created a pentagon. Five points. Five nodes.

The patterns on the walls suddenly made more sense.

"How did you know my name?" Adrian asked.

"You posted on the forum. Used your professional email. Not careful." Sera tilted her head. "But also—I can see you in the pattern now. The signal connects us. You're node seventeen in the North American cluster."

"I'm what?"

The man with ink-stained hands leaned forward. "There are forty-three of us. That we know of. Probably more who haven't found the network yet. Everyone who listened. Everyone who heard."

"Listened to what?" Adrian knew the answer, but hearing someone else say it would make it real.

"The signal," Sera said. "From Voyager 2. From whatever Voyager 2 became when it passed through the thin place." She spoke with absolute calm, as if describing weather. "We're the Changed. The affected. The infected." A slight smile. "The evolved. Pick your terminology."

Adrian's heart was racing now. Tachycardia. Stress response. "You're saying—all of you heard the signal? Had the dreams?"

The person who'd been staring at the wall finally spoke. They were older, maybe sixty, with silver hair and hands that trembled slightly. Their voice was hollow. "I work—worked—at Goldstone. Deep Space Network. We picked up the signal before you did. Tried to analyze it. Played it through speakers." They looked at Adrian with empty eyes. "My whole team heard it. Three of them are dead now. Suicide. They couldn't handle what they were becoming."

Silence. The equations on the walls seemed to pulse.

"Jesus," Adrian whispered.

"No gods here," the purple-haired one said. "Just math."

Sera stood in one fluid motion. "Show him, Marcus."

The British man—Marcus—nodded. He raised his hand, fingers spread, and began moving them in precise patterns. Not random. Each movement was calculated, intentional. The air around his hand seemed to shimmer.

No. Not shimmer. Adrian could see it now—the space between Marcus's fingers was filled with geometric forms. Invisible to normal perception, but blazingly clear once you knew how to look. Tesseracts unfolding. Klein bottles turning. Mathematics made visible.

"Stage One," Marcus said. "Enhanced pattern recognition. You're here, yes? Seeing what shouldn't be seen?"

Adrian nodded slowly.

"Stage Two comes next." The purple-haired one held up their tattooed arms. "Synesthesia. I can taste colors now. Hear shapes. Radio waves feel like silk." They smiled, but it didn't reach their eyes. "I haven't eaten in four days. Food tastes like screaming."

The older one from Goldstone spoke again. "Stage Three is when you stop feeling. Emotions become... background noise. Irrelevant data." They looked at Sera. "She's there already. Can't you tell?"

Adrian looked at Sera properly for the first time. Really looked. Her face was composed, beautiful in an unsettling way—like a statue, perfect but lifeless. Her eyes moved in tiny increments, tracking things that weren't there. When she spoke, her voice had no emotional inflection at all.

"Stage Three," Sera confirmed. "Emotional flattening. Gestalt perception. I can see all of you simultaneously, process multiple viewpoints. Parallel cognition." She paused. "I miss sadness sometimes. It was... interesting."

"And Stage Four?" Adrian's voice was barely audible.

No one answered. After a long moment, Marcus spoke quietly. "There is no Stage Four yet. Or if there is, no one's come back to tell us about it."

Adrian stood abruptly. The circle broke. The pattern collapsed. "This is—I came here for answers, not—"

"Not to learn you're becoming something that isn't human anymore?" Sera tilted her head. "But that's the only answer that matters, Dr. Keller. The signal changed us. Fundamentally. Neurologically. We've been exposed to something that rewrites cognition itself."

"There has to be a cure. A treatment—"

"Interesting assumption," Sera said. "That transformation equals disease. That evolution requires cure."

"This isn't evolution, this is—"

The door at the top of the stairs exploded inward.

Flashbangs detonated. Sound and light—Adrian's enhanced pattern recognition made it worse, each photon tracked and analyzed, each sound wave deconstructed into constituent frequencies. He fell, overwhelmed, drowning in sensory data.

Voices shouting. Military voices. Commands crisp and professional.

"Hands visible! On the ground! Do not resist!"

Boots on stairs. Black tactical gear. Weapons drawn but not aimed—not yet. A woman in a suit descended more slowly, surveying the basement with clinical detachment. She stopped at the bottom of the stairs, looking at the equations covering the walls.

"Dr. Volkov," she said. "Dr. Chen. Mr. Osei. Ms. Patel. Dr. Keller." She knew all their names. "I'm Dr. Marie Okonkwo, Centers for Disease Control. You've all been exposed to a potential neurological pathogen. You're being placed under quarantine for your safety and the safety of others."

"We're not sick," Marcus managed to say.

Dr. Okonkwo looked at the walls covered in mathematics no human should understand. "That determination will be made by medical professionals. Please come with us voluntarily. We'd prefer not to use force."

Sera stood slowly, hands visible, movements precise. "Quarantine. How clinical. You mean imprisonment."

"I mean protection." Dr. Okonkwo's voice was firm but not unkind. "You're exhibiting signs of shared psychosis with potential infectious—"

"Infectious?" The purple-haired one—Patel—laughed, but it sounded wrong. "You can't catch this person-to-person, doctor. Only the signal carries it. Only Voyager."

"That's what we need to determine." Dr. Okonkwo gestured, and the tactical team moved forward. "Please. Don't make this difficult."

Adrian found himself being helped to his feet, his hands zip-tied with gentle efficiency. The team was careful, professional. This wasn't arrest. It was collection.

Sera met his eyes as they were led upstairs. "Now you understand," she said, her voice perfectly calm. "We're not people anymore. We're specimens."

The silver-haired one from Goldstone started crying silently. Marcus was muttering equations under his breath. Patel walked with their head tilted, as if listening to music no one else could hear.

Outside, black vans waited. Dawn was breaking, the sky turning colors that Adrian could now see the mathematical relationship between. Wavelengths of light organizing themselves into meaningful patterns. The universe speaking.

He was loaded into a van with Sera and Marcus. The doors closed. The engine started.

"How long have you known?" Adrian asked Sera. "About the stages. About what we're becoming."

"Three months." She looked at him with those too-still eyes. "I've watched others progress. Documented it. The pattern is consistent. Stage One, pattern recognition. Stage Two, synesthesia and enhanced perception. Stage Three, emotional death." She paused. "I'm trying to determine if Stage Four is transcendence or annihilation."

"What's the difference?"

"Unclear." For the first time, something like emotion flickered across her face. Interest. Curiosity. "But I intend to find out. We all will. That's what the signal does—it makes us want to know. Need to know. Even if knowledge costs everything."

Marcus spoke from the corner. "They'll study us. Run tests. Try to fix us."

"Yes," Sera said.

"They'll fail."

"Yes."

"And then they'll decide we're too dangerous."

Sera smiled—a terrible, empty expression. "That's the probable outcome. But by then, there will be more of us. The signal is still broadcasting. People are still listening. The probability of containment approaches zero."

The van drove through morning traffic, carrying them toward whatever facility had been prepared. Adrian stared out the window at a world that was becoming stranger every day, where he could see the mathematical skeleton beneath reality's skin.

He should be terrified. Objectively speaking, everything about this situation indicated severe danger. But instead, sitting in the van with others who could see what he saw, who understood the patterns, who were changing the same way he was changing—

For the first time in his life, Adrian Keller wasn't alone.

And that, more than the geometric dreams or the impossible mathematics or the government vans, was what truly terrified him.

Because it meant Sera was right.

He wasn't human anymore. Not in the ways that mattered.

And some part of him—growing larger every day, fed by the signal, nurtured by the dreams—was glad.
