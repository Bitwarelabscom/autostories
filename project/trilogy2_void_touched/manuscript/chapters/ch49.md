# Chapter 49: The Soldier's Logic

Colonel Thomas Reeves stood in the Project Threshold command center and watched humanity die in real-time.

The screens showed fracture zones spreading across the globe like cancer. Red zones where physics failed. Where humans went mad. Where eight million had died in Jakarta alone, with billions more projected. Cities evacuating. Infrastructure collapsing. Civilization retreating underground while monsters thrived in impossible conditions on the surface.

The Changed had done this.

Not directly. Reeves understood the mechanics—Voyager's approach was causing the fractures, the Changed were just first wave, harbingers, symptoms of larger phenomenon.

But symptoms could be treated. Sometimes treating symptoms saved the patient while you searched for cure.

"Status on weapon systems?" he asked.

Lieutenant Chen—human, unChanged, loyal—reported: "Six nuclear-tipped missiles ready for deployment. Electromagnetic pulse weapons online. Conventional explosives as backup. We have enough firepower to destroy anything in near-Earth orbit."

"And the thin place around Voyager?"

"Simulations show weapons will pass through unstable space-time. Uncertain if they'll detonate properly. Physics in fracture zones doesn't follow normal rules."

"Then we fire everything. Redundancy. If one weapon system fails, others compensate." Reeves pulled up trajectories. "Launch window is in four weeks. Voyager will be close enough to target but not so close the thin place engulfs our launch platforms."

"Sir, the Changed have sent seventeen warnings. They claim destroying Voyager won't stop the fractures. That thin places are property of space-time itself, not controlled by the probe."

"The Changed lie. Manipulate. They want us to do nothing while their transformation claims humanity." Reeves had seen the pattern. The Changed coordinating their escape. Building settlements in fracture zones. Thriving while humans died. "They're replacing us. Can't let that happen."

"Sir... what if they're right? What if the attack fails and you die trying?"

Reeves turned to face Chen. Young. Idealistic. Hadn't seen what Reeves had seen in Tehran when the bioweapon turned human soldiers into screaming vectors of contagion. Hadn't watched friends die while containment protocols failed. Hadn't learned that sometimes the only response to existential threat was overwhelming force.

"Then I die trying," Reeves said simply. "Better than doing nothing while humanity goes extinct."

"The scientists say—"

"The scientists said the Changed were safe to study. Said quarantine would hold. Said the transformation wasn't contagious." Reeves pulled up footage of Jakarta's collapse. Eight million dead in minutes. "The scientists are wrong. Have been wrong from the beginning. This is military problem now. Requires military solution."

He'd been refining Project Threshold for months. Ever since the Changed escaped, ever since fractures started forming, ever since it became clear diplomatic solutions wouldn't work. The plan was elegant: six simultaneous strikes on Voyager, multiple weapon systems, redundant targeting, enough destructive force to vaporize the probe and collapse the thin place around it.

The Changed said it wouldn't work. That Voyager was doorway, not cause. That destroying the probe would change nothing.

But the Changed were the enemy. Their words were suspect. Their warnings were psychological warfare designed to prevent effective response.

Reeves had learned to trust action over words.

"Dr. Okonkwo is still requesting meeting," Chen reported. "Wants to discuss your attack plans before you launch."

"Okonkwo destroyed the cure. Condemned billions to die or transform. She's discredited herself. Has no credibility."

"She says the Changed would respect voluntary cure use. That destroying the cure prevented government coercion, not individual choice."

"She's rationalizing mass murder." Reeves pulled up casualty projections. Three billion dead by Voyager arrival. Two billion underground. Two billion transformed or dying. "The cure could have saved them. She eliminated that option. That's genocide."

"Or it's preserving free choice—"

"Lieutenant, I need you focused. Can you execute mission or do I need different personnel?"

Chen hesitated. Then: "I can execute, sir."

"Good. Because in four weeks, we end this. Destroy Voyager. Collapse the thin places. Save what's left of humanity before the Changed replace us entirely."

The logic was clean. Military. Based on threat assessment and resource allocation and acceptable casualty rates. The Changed were enemy force occupying territory. Voyager was their supply line. Cut the supply line, enemy forces failed.

Simple.

Except.

In quiet moments—rare, because Reeves avoided quiet moments—doubt crept in.

What if the Changed were right? What if destroying Voyager changed nothing? What if this was evolution, not invasion, and resistance was futile?

What if he was attacking solution because he couldn't comprehend the problem?

Reeves crushed the doubt. Had learned in Tehran that hesitation killed. That second-guessing paralyzed. That sometimes you had to act on incomplete information because waiting for perfect intelligence meant everyone died while you deliberated.

The Changed were threat. Voyager was target. Launch was in four weeks.

Everything else was noise.

"Sir, incoming transmission. From the Changed network. They're broadcasting on all military frequencies."

"Ignore it."

"Sir, it's... they're showing us what they see. The attack. Your attack. They're showing it failing. Showing you dying."

Reeves pulled up the transmission. Saw himself on screen—or computer-generated approximation, or Changed hallucination, or temporal perception, depending on who you believed.

Saw his ships approaching Voyager. Saw the thin place around the probe tearing his fleet apart. Saw weapons firing, passing through the probe without touching it, detonating in empty space. Saw himself dying in command chair as hull breach vented atmosphere.

Saw the Changed pulling survivors from wreckage afterward. Rescuing the man who'd tried to kill them.

"Propaganda," Reeves said. "Designed to prevent attack. Ignore it."

"Sir, what if it's real? What if they can actually see the future?"

"Then the future is propaganda too. We make our own choices, Lieutenant. Determine our own outcomes. I won't let posthuman monsters dictate human destiny."

But the video haunted him. The Changed had been right about everything so far. About the transformation being irreversible. About fractures forming. About Jakarta's collapse. About Okonkwo destroying the cure.

What if they were right about this too?

What if he was flying into certain death, accomplishing nothing, dying for gesture instead of victory?

No. Couldn't think that way. Had to maintain conviction. Had to trust training. Had to believe overwhelming force would prevail because believing anything else meant accepting defeat.

Reeves returned to mission planning. Trajectories. Timing. Weapon systems. Everything that could be controlled. Everything that followed physics and logic and military doctrine.

Everything except the Changed themselves.

Who existed in conditions that shouldn't exist. Who thrived in fracture zones that killed humans. Who claimed to see futures and experience time non-linearly and perceive dimensions humans couldn't access.

Who might be telling truth about Voyager being unkillable.

"Sir, another transmission. Dr. Okonkwo. She's... she's been arrested. Broadcasting from detention. Asking you to reconsider the attack."

Reeves pulled up Okonkwo's message. She looked exhausted. Defeated. But determined.

"Colonel Reeves," she said directly to camera. "I know you won't believe the Changed. Won't trust their warnings. Won't accept their temporal perception as real. So let me put this in terms you understand: your attack will fail because you're targeting symptom, not cause."

She pulled up data. Models. Equations that went over Reeves's head but looked professionally presented.

"Voyager isn't creating the thin places. It's passing through region where they exist naturally. Like ship sailing through fog. Destroying the ship doesn't eliminate the fog. Earth is entering that region. The thin places are property of local space-time structure. Will persist regardless of Voyager's existence."

"You destroyed the cure," Reeves said to the screen, knowing she couldn't hear him. "You condemned billions. Why should I trust your analysis?"

"I destroyed the cure because it was philosophical weapon, not medical treatment," Okonkwo continued, as if anticipating his objection. "Same logic applies here. You're planning philosophical strike. Attacking what you can target because you can't accept the truth: transformation is inevitable. Not from malice. From physics. From consciousness encountering reality it can't process."

She leaned closer to camera.

"The Changed will save you after your attack fails. They've told me. Shown me probabilities. You'll fly into the thin place, your ship will fragment, you'll die—and they'll rescue you anyway. Will prove they're not monsters. Will demonstrate mercy you refused to show them."

"Lies," Reeves muttered.

"Thomas." Her voice softened. She'd never used his first name before. "I've studied the Changed for months. They don't lie. Can't lie. Stage Three and Four consciousness processes truth directly. Deception requires emotional manipulation they've lost capacity for. When they say you'll die, they're reporting observation, not making threat."

"Then I'll die." Reeves straightened. "Better than living in world where humanity is replaced by these... these posthuman approximations."

"They're not approximations. They're completions. And you'll understand that when they save you. When you see them choose mercy despite having every reason for revenge."

The transmission ended.

Reeves sat alone in command center, surrounded by weapons that might not work, planning attack that might accomplish nothing, leading strike force that might die for gesture.

But gesture mattered. Showing humanity still fought mattered. Resisting inevitable mattered because accepting inevitable without resistance meant surrendering what made humans human.

Even if the Changed were right. Even if the attack failed. Even if they saved him afterward to prove some point about posthuman morality.

He'd still strike. Still fight. Still resist.

Because Colonel Thomas Reeves had learned in Tehran that sometimes you fought knowing you'd lose.

Sometimes fighting was the point.

Sometimes resistance itself was victory even when resistance failed.

In four weeks, he'd launch.

In four weeks, he'd probably die.

In four weeks, he'd prove humanity still chose its own actions, even when actions led nowhere.

And if the Changed saved him afterward?

Well.

Then he'd have to live with being wrong.

Live with being rescued by beings he'd tried to exterminate.

Live with the knowledge that monsters showed more humanity than human did.

But that was four weeks away.

For now, there was only mission planning.

Only weapons systems.

Only the clean logic of military solutions to problems too large for military solutions.

Colonel Thomas Reeves returned to his calculations.

And prepared to die fighting evolution itself.

Knowing he'd lose.

Unable to stop anyway.

Because sometimes that's what soldiers did.

Fight the unwinnable war.

For principle.

For species.

For the simple fact that consciousness capable of choice had to choose something.

Even when all choices led to extinction.

The attack launched in four weeks.

The Changed waited to rescue him.

And between those certainties, Reeves existed in the only space available: conviction without hope.

The soldier's final logic.

Fight because fighting is what soldiers do.

Even when fighting changes nothing.

Especially then.

The countdown continued.

Twenty-eight days.

Until gesture replaced by reality.

Until conviction met truth.

Until human soldier learned what posthuman mercy looked like.

Reeves planned.

The Changed waited.

And the outcome was already certain to everyone except the man who'd chosen it.
