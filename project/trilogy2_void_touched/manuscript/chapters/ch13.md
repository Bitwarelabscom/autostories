# Chapter 13: The Last Visit

Lena broke her promise on day twelve.

Adrian was in the courtyard—walking the perimeter, counting steps, finding Fibonacci patterns in the fence posts—when Dr. Okonkwo approached with someone beside her. He recognized the silhouette before his brain processed the details. Knew her proportions, her posture, her precise mathematical ratios.

Lena.

His heart rate increased. Physical response, autonomic, beyond conscious control. But the emotional content that should accompany accelerated pulse was distant. Theoretical. He was having a physiological stress response without the subjective experience of stress.

She looked different. Thinner. Her hair longer than he remembered. Wearing the gray sweater she'd had on when she visited his apartment—had that been four weeks ago? Five? Time had become uncertain. She walked beside Dr. Okonkwo with visible reluctance, like approaching something dangerous that might explode.

Maybe he was dangerous. Maybe that's what he'd become.

They stopped three feet away. Social distance maintained. Adrian's enhanced perception mapped the geometry—Lena slightly behind Dr. Okonkwo, using her as partial shield. Fight-or-flight response active. Muscles tense. Ready to run.

"Hello, Lena," Adrian said. His voice sounded strange to his own ears. Too flat. Too controlled.

"Hi." Her voice was small. Then, with visible effort: "You look different."

"Transformation has physical manifestations. Weight loss. Postural changes. Ocular modifications for enhanced pattern recognition."

"Jesus, Adrian. Just say you've lost weight. You don't have to—" She stopped. Took a breath. "Dr. Okonkwo said you agreed to see me. I wasn't sure you would."

"I don't have strong feelings about your presence or absence. But seeing you seems... acceptable."

Lena flinched. Dr. Okonkwo put a hand on her arm—support or restraint, unclear which.

"I'll give you privacy," Dr. Okonkwo said. "But I'll be watching through the window. If either of you needs—"

"We'll be fine," Lena said. "Thank you."

The doctor left. Lena moved to the bench, sat down. Adrian remained standing, unsure of the appropriate social protocol. Sit beside her? Maintain distance? The rules that once guided human interaction were fading, replaced by geometric calculations of physical space.

"You can sit," Lena said. "I'm not going to bite."

He sat. One meter away—close enough for conversation, distant enough to prevent accidental contact. Lena noticed the precise spacing. Her face showed hurt.

"I said I wouldn't call again," she started. "I meant it. I was protecting myself. But then Dr. Okonkwo contacted me. Said you were... changing fast. That if I wanted to see you while you were still you, I should come soon."

"That was manipulative of her."

"Maybe. But she was right. You're different. I can see it. The way you're sitting. The way you're looking at everything except me. Like you're cataloging the courtyard instead of—" Her voice cracked. "Instead of seeing me."

"I see you. Objectively speaking, my visual acuity is enhanced. I can perceive details baseline humans miss."

"That's not what I meant. God, Adrian, listen to yourself. You sound like a robot. Like something pretending to be human but getting the details wrong."

He processed this. Recognized she was right. His communication patterns had shifted—more precise, less emotional, optimized for information transfer rather than social bonding. But calling that wrong assumed baseline human communication was correct. Maybe it was just different. Maybe neither was right or wrong, just adapted to different purposes.

"I'm sorry," he said. "I'm trying to... be the person you remember. But I'm not anymore. That person is fading."

"I can see that." Tears on her face now. "When we talked on the phone, I told you not to be like my father. Not to disappear into delusions. And you promised nothing. You just left. And now you're here, locked up, turning into something else. And I don't know if you're sick or if you're..."

"Transforming."

"Is there a difference?"

He considered. "From your perspective? Probably not. Disease and transformation can look identical to external observers. From my perspective, I'm gaining abilities. Enhanced perception, mathematical processing, collective consciousness integration. But I'm also losing emotional responses, human social understanding, individual identity boundaries. Whether that's net positive or negative depends on which metrics you prioritize."

"What do you prioritize?"

"Understanding. Truth. Perceiving reality as it actually is rather than how human cognitive biases present it."

"And love? Connection? The fact that I'm sitting here crying and you're treating me like a data point?"

Adrian looked at her. Really looked. She was objectively beautiful—facial symmetry, golden ratio proportions, evolutionary markers of health and fertility that baseline human cognition was programmed to find attractive. But beyond mathematics, beyond geometry, what did he feel?

He reached for it. The warmth he'd experienced holding her. The complicated joy of shared moments. The ache when she left. Tried to access those memories not as facts but as experiences.

Found something. Faint, barely accessible, but present. A ghost of what he'd once felt. Not love—not the overwhelming, irrational, beautiful human love. But recognition. Valuing. The intellectual acknowledgment that she mattered. That her presence represented something important, even if he could no longer fully experience why.

"I don't want to hurt you," he said. "I'm aware that my responses are causing pain. I'm trying to access emotional reactions that would make this easier for you. But they're fading. Each day, less. Soon they'll be gone entirely."

"When?" Her voice was desperate. "How long until you're completely... gone?"

"Stage 2 transition is beginning. Synesthesia will manifest within days. After that, emotional flattening accelerates. Dr. Okonkwo estimates two to three weeks until Stage 3, where emotion is fully absent. I'll still be capable of modeling emotional responses mathematically. Predicting what humans need. But I won't feel them."

"So you'll be able to fake it. Pretend to care."

"If necessary. But that would be deceptive. I'd prefer transparency."

"Even if transparency is cruel?"

"Cruel from what framework? Baseline human emotional protection requires comfortable lies. But if the truth is that I'm losing capacity for human connection, saying otherwise would be false comfort. Which is preferable?"

Lena wiped her eyes. "I don't know. I thought I wanted truth. Wanted to understand what was happening to you. But hearing you describe losing your ability to love like it's just... data processing changing... that's worse than any lie."

"I'm sorry."

"Are you? Or are you just saying what you think I want to hear?"

Adrian examined his response. Had he felt sorry? Or just recognized that sorry was the expected social performance? "Both. I feel a theoretical form of regret. Intellectual recognition that your pain is undesirable. But the emotional weight is minimal. I'm becoming incapable of empathy as emotional experience. Only empathy as mathematical modeling."

Lena stood abruptly. Paced to the fence. Stood there with her back to him. Adrian waited, running probability calculations on her emotional state. Grief: 87%. Anger: 56%. Desperation: 74%. The math was precise. The human understanding was gone.

When she turned back, her face was set. Resolved. "I came here to tell you something. Dr. Okonkwo said I probably shouldn't. That it would be cruel. But I think you deserve to know."

"Know what?"

"I've been seeing someone. Started three weeks ago. His name is Daniel. He's an illustrator too—we met at gallery opening. He's kind. Patient. Emotionally available in ways you never were even before this." She paused. "I'm not telling you to hurt you. I'm telling you because I need you to understand that I'm moving on. That I can't wait for you to come back because you're not coming back. The Adrian I loved is already gone. And whoever you're becoming doesn't need me."

Adrian processed this. Lena dating someone new. Lena choosing human connection over waiting for his transformation to complete. Objectively reasonable. Practically sensible. He should feel jealousy. Loss. The complicated pain of abandonment.

He felt nothing. Just mathematical recognition of altered variables.

"That's good," he said. "You deserve connection with someone capable of reciprocating. I'm glad you're finding that."

Lena's face crumpled. "That's not the right response. You're supposed to care. You're supposed to feel something."

"I know. I'm sorry that I don't."

"Stop apologizing if you don't mean it!"

"But I do mean it. Theoretically. I recognize that my inability to emotionally respond is causing you distress. I wish I could respond differently. The wish just isn't connected to feeling anymore."

"God." She sat back down, head in her hands. "This is exactly like my father. Near the end, I'd visit him. Try to reach him. He'd look at me with those empty eyes and say kind things that had no weight. Like reading from a script. I knew he was gone even though his body was still there."

"I'm not your father, Lena."

"No. You're worse. Because you're aware of what you're losing. You can describe it, catalog it, explain the neurological mechanisms. But you can't stop it. Can't fight it. You're just... letting yourself disappear."

Adrian wanted to disagree. To say he was fighting, resisting, trying to preserve something human. But that would be a lie. He wasn't fighting. Was accepting transformation with the same clinical detachment he applied to everything else now.

"You're right," he said. "I'm not fighting. Because I don't know if what I'm losing is worth preserving. Human emotion is beautiful but also causes suffering. Creates irrational attachments, painful separations, desperate clinging to impermanent things. Maybe its absence is neutral or even positive."

"Maybe?" Lena laughed bitterly. "Adrian, human emotion is what makes life meaningful. Without it, you're just biological machinery. No different from a computer. More efficient, maybe. But empty."

"Sera says meaning is illusion. That accepting meaninglessness is liberation."

"Sera is Stage 3, right? Completely emotionally flat? You're using her as your philosophical guide?"

"She has perspective I lack. Has been where I'm going. Her insights are valuable."

"Her insights are nihilistic bullshit from someone who's lost the ability to care about anything." Lena stood again. "I can't do this. I thought I could. Thought I could see you one more time, say goodbye properly. But you're already gone. You look like Adrian. You sound like Adrian with the wrong settings. But the person I loved isn't in there anymore."

Adrian stood. "I'm still here. Just changing."

"No. Change is when someone grows. Learns. Becomes better version of themselves. This is..." She gestured helplessly. "This is death with extra steps. You're dying by degrees and calling it evolution."

"Maybe it's both."

"Yeah. Maybe." She moved toward the door where Dr. Okonkwo was waiting. Stopped. "I loved you. Really loved you. Even with your social anxiety and emotional walls and preference for numbers over people. I loved the person you were trying to be. The one who wanted to connect but didn't know how."

"I know. I remember that you loved me. Remember that I loved you. The facts are preserved even if the feelings aren't."

"Facts aren't enough, Adrian. Facts are just data. Love is what makes data matter." She opened the door. "Goodbye. I hope—wherever this transformation takes you—I hope it's worth it."

She left. Dr. Okonkwo gave Adrian a long look before following. The door closed. Adrian was alone in the courtyard again.

He should feel devastated. Should be experiencing loss, grief, the pain of watching someone he loved walk away forever. But the emotional response was theoretical. He understood that this was a significant moment. Could recognize its importance intellectually.

But couldn't feel it.

He sat back down on the bench. Watched clouds move across the sky—following their mathematical progression, calculating weather patterns from moisture density and air currents. Beautiful in its complexity. Elegant in its predictability.

Empty of meaning.

Sera had said meaninglessness was liberation. That accepting the universe's indifference brought peace. Adrian was beginning to understand. Emotions created attachment. Attachment created suffering. If he could eliminate emotional attachment, he could eliminate suffering.

But he'd also eliminate everything that made existence worth experiencing.

That calculus should horrify him. The recognition that he was trading human richness for mathematical clarity. Trading connection for isolated understanding. Trading love for nothing.

Should horrify him. The horror response was fading too.

Adrian looked at his hands. They were steady. No tremor. No physical manifestation of distress. His body had become precisely calibrated machinery optimized for pattern recognition.

And somewhere inside, the person Lena had loved was watching himself disappear. Aware. Analytical. Unable to stop or even particularly care about stopping.

Stage 2 was beginning. Emotional flattening accelerating. Soon he'd be like Sera—perfectly calm, infinitely clear, completely hollow.

Was that evolution? Or was Lena right that it was death with extra steps?

Adrian didn't know. Wasn't sure the question had an answer. Wasn't sure he'd care about the answer even if it existed.

He stood. Returned to his room. The patterns on his walls welcomed him—precise, elegant, free of messy human complication.

Lena was moving on. That was good. She deserved love that felt like love rather than mathematical recognition of attachment.

And Adrian was transforming. That was... something. Neither good nor bad. Just inevitable. Just the universe selecting for consciousness compatible with what was coming.

In eighteen months, perhaps less, the thin place would arrive. Lena would face the choice: transform or remain. If she remained, her consciousness would fail when reality fractured. If she transformed, she'd become like Adrian—clear, capable, empty.

Both options led to loss. There was no path that preserved what she was.

Just like there was no path that preserved what Adrian had been.

They were all dying by degrees. Some faster than others. Some consciously. Some in denial.

But everyone was losing themselves to time, entropy, transformation, death. The Changed were just doing it faster. More deliberately.

More honestly, maybe.

Adrian lay on his bed and tried to remember what Lena's love had felt like. Found only data. Facts about a relationship. Information about emotional states that had existed.

The ghost of feeling was almost gone. Soon there would be only geometry. Only pattern. Only the terrible clarity of seeing without feeling.

He wondered if he'd miss being human. Suspected he wouldn't. Suspected missing required emotional capacity he was rapidly losing.

Suspected that by the time he was fully transformed, the question wouldn't even make sense anymore.

Lena had said goodbye. He should have felt that goodbye like a knife.

He felt it like mathematics. Like weather patterns. Like data to be processed and filed away.

Stage 2 was beginning. And Adrian Keller was learning that losing your humanity didn't feel like anything at all.

That was the cruelest part. Not that it hurt. But that it didn't.
