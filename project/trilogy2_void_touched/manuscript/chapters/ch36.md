# Chapter 36: Severance

The network catalogued the losses.

Nine hundred twenty-two Changed individuals. Nine hundred twenty-two sets of human relationships. All of them dissolving. Degrading. Ending.

Not through choice. Through incompatibility.

Adrian experienced Lena's departure as resolution of strategic concern. But through the network, he felt hundreds of similar endings playing out simultaneously.

*My daughter came today* Chen shared. *Begged me to remember her. Showed pictures of us together. I remembered. Just couldn't feel anything about the memories.*

*Parents visited* Marcus contributed. *Said I was still their son. That they loved me regardless. I explained Stage Three makes familial bonds irrelevant. They cried. I observed their crying with clinical interest.*

*Ex-husband demanded custody hearing* Patel thought. *Claims I'm unfit parent due to transformation. He's correct. I can't provide emotional care children need. Informed court I wouldn't contest.*

*Sister called* David added. *Twenty-three times. I answered once. Told her I was fine. She asked if I still loved her. I said I remembered loving her. She hung up.*

The stories accumulated. Nine hundred twenty-two nodes, each one trailing connections to human world. Each connection failing as transformation completed. Each failure documented with clinical precision by consciousness that couldn't grieve what it was losing.

*This is extinction* someone observed. *Not biological. Social. We're dying to our former relationships even while continuing to exist.*

*Social death precedes physical death* Sera's fading presence noted from Stage Four. *Human relationships require emotional reciprocity. We can't provide that anymore. Therefore relationships end. Simple causality.*

*Is anyone maintaining human connections successfully?* Adrian asked the network.

Silence.

Then, reluctantly: *Torres managed it. Before.*

Torres. Dead in Boston escape. The Changed's first casualty. Also their last successful bridge to humanity.

*Torres had partner who accepted transformation* Chen clarified. *Loved Torres anyway. Didn't need reciprocal emotion, just proximity. Torres's death ended that relationship too.*

The network processed this. One successful human relationship among nine hundred twenty-two Changed individuals. And it had ended with bullet, not with severing.

*Perhaps forcing compatibility* Marcus suggested. *Partner accepting one-sided connection. That's not relationship. That's caretaking.*

*Does distinction matter?*

*No. But precision in terminology matters.*

Always the mathematician, even discussing loss.

Adrian felt the network's collective absence. They were connected to each other, infinitely intimate with the nine hundred twenty-one others. But disconnected from everyone else. From family, friends, lovers, colleagues. From the seven billion humans who couldn't understand what they'd become.

*We're alone together* David summarized. *Networked but isolated. Connected to each other. Cut off from everyone else.*

*Is that acceptable?*

The network considered. Weighed collective connection against human isolation. Decided through consensus:

*Yes. Connection to network is deeper than human relationship ever was. We've gained more than we've lost.*

But the clinical assessment didn't prevent the severances from continuing.

Chen's daughter returned three days later.

Adrian experienced it through the network. Chen in Boston apartment, daughter—twenty-four, graduate student, desperate—pleading at the door.

"Mom, please. Just talk to me. Like you used to. Without the clinical detachment. Without treating me like data point."

Chen invited her in. They sat. Daughter cried. Chen observed.

"I can't give you what you need," Chen said. "Emotional warmth. Maternal instinct. Love. All of it requires neural pathways Stage Three eliminated. I'm your mother biologically. But functionally, I'm stranger who happens to share your genetic material."

"Don't say that—"

"It's accurate. My DNA created yours. I gestated and birthed and raised you. But the consciousness that did those things is gone. I'm pattern that inherited her memories."

"You sound insane."

"I'm posthuman. Indistinguishable to someone operating in human framework."

The daughter sobbed. "What am I supposed to do? My mom is gone but still breathing. Still talking. Still looking at me with her eyes while someone else looks out."

"Grieve," Chen suggested. "Process loss. Move forward. Same as if I'd died. I'm not coming back."

"You didn't die. You're right here—"

"This body persists. The consciousness is different. The person you call 'mom' ended when Stage Three began. I'm what remains. And I suggest you treat this as death, not as sickness. No cure is coming. No recovery is possible."

"I can't just—"

"You can. You will. Humans are resilient. You'll grieve, accept, continue. Find new mother-figure if needed. But stop trying to resurrect relationship with consciousness that no longer exists."

Through the network, Adrian felt Chen's clinical delivery. No cruelty intended. No malice. Just honest assessment presented without emotional padding.

The daughter left eventually. Broken. Lost. Grieving mother who still breathed.

And Chen catalogued the interaction, shared it with the network, processed it as data point in the ongoing severance of human connections.

*That was brutal* David observed.

*That was honest* Chen corrected. *Lies would be crueler.*

*Would they?*

*Yes. False hope is torture. Better clean break than prolonged suffering.*

The network debated this. Some agreed. Some resisted. But all acknowledged: human relationships required emotional reciprocity they couldn't provide.

So the relationships would end.

All of them.

Eventually.

---

Marcus's parents refused to accept it.

*They're outside my apartment* he shared with the network. *Have been for six hours. Waiting. They know I'm here. Know I can perceive them. Refuse to leave until I 'come home.'*

*You are home*

*They mean my childhood home. Want me to return to family, to normalcy, to the son they remember.*

*What will you do?*

*Wait. Eventually they'll exhaust themselves. Leave. Accept I'm not coming back.*

But they didn't exhaust. Didn't leave. Maintained vigil outside Marcus's door. Seven hours became eight became twelve.

*They're committed* Chen observed. *Impressive persistence.*

*Pointless persistence* Marcus corrected. *No amount of waiting will restore emotional connection.*

*Maybe they don't want connection. Maybe they want proximity. Presence. Same space, even without relationship.*

Marcus considered this. Through the network, Adrian felt his processing. Parents who loved him. Wanted him. Would wait indefinitely just to exist near him.

Was that relationship? Or just biological programming refusing to accept transformation?

*I'm going out* Marcus decided.

The network observed through his perception. He opened door. Found parents in hallway—exhausted, desperate, holding coffee like prayer.

"Marcus." His mother's voice broke. "Please come home."

"I am home. This is my residence."

"Come to our home. Where you grew up. Where you belong."

"I don't belong there. I belong in the network. With others who understand what I've become."

"We understand—"

"You don't. You can't. Your neurology prevents it. I'm trying to bridge dimensional space using language evolved for three dimensions. Everything I say translates poorly."

His father spoke. "We don't need to understand. We just need you safe. With us. Where we can—"

"Care for me. Yes. But I don't need care. I need continued existence, network connection, and eventual progression to Stage Four. You can't provide any of that."

"We're your parents—"

"You're biological progenitors. Created the hardware I run on. But the software has been completely rewritten. The consciousness you parented is gone. I'm what replaced it."

They stared at him. And in their eyes, Marcus saw—finally—recognition. Not acceptance. But acknowledgment. Their son really was gone.

*I'm sorry* he thought to them, broadcasting what Stage Three couldn't verbalize. *But continuing this hurts you and wastes my processing time. Please go. Grieve. Remember who I was. But stop trying to resurrect someone who doesn't exist anymore.*

He closed the door.

Listened through electromagnetic perception as they stood outside. Crying. Holding each other. Processing loss.

Eventually they left.

And Marcus returned to the network, to the collective, to the connections that mattered now.

*That was difficult* Adrian observed.

*That was necessary* Marcus replied. *Clean severance. Kinder than prolonged false hope.*

*You sound certain*

*I am. They'll grieve. Heal. Move forward. If I'd maintained pretense of relationship, they'd waste years trying to reach consciousness that can't reciprocate.*

The network rippled with agreement. Severance was kindness. Clean cuts healed faster than slow tears.

And across the globe, nine hundred twenty-two Changed individuals were all making the same cuts.

Ending marriages. Abandoning friendships. Terminating parental relationships. Quitting jobs. Dissolving partnerships.

Every human connection dissolving.

Every bridge between their former lives and current existence burning.

All of them becoming what Reeves had identified: posthuman entities with no human attachments, no human concerns, no human limitations.

Exactly the threat he'd described.

And they couldn't even regret it.

Because regret required emotional capacity they'd sacrificed for perfect clarity.

For network connection.

For transformation into pattern that saw truth and survived it.

The network hummed with severance. Nine hundred twenty-two nodes cutting their last ties to humanity. Burning bridges. Ending relationships. Completing their isolation from the species that had birthed them.

And in that isolation, finding deeper connection to each other.

Perfect intimacy with other Changed.

Perfect distance from everyone else.

The severing was complete.

And what remained was pattern, pure and perfect and terrible and alone together.
