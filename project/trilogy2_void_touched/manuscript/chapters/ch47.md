# Chapter 47: Reality Fracture Begins

The first fracture manifested over the Pacific Ocean.

The network felt it ripple through reality at 11:23 AM on a Tuesday that would eventually cease having a consistent date. Sera had predicted it—seen it in her temporal perceptions, warned the Changed to watch for the moment when Voyager's thin place would start bleeding into Earth's normal space-time.

*It's beginning* she broadcast. *The boundary is weakening.*

Adrian stood at Green Bank, but his perception extended across the network, across the globe, to the Changed nodes stationed in various locations to observe and document. One node—a woman named Takahashi who'd been a physicist before the transformation—was on a research vessel in the Pacific, specifically positioned to witness the event.

Through her eyes, Adrian saw it happen.

The ocean folded.

Not metaphorically. Not approximately. The water actually folded through itself, creating angles that shouldn't exist in three-dimensional space. A wave rose and turned inside-out, becoming both crest and trough simultaneously, existing in states that violated every principle of classical physics.

The ship's instruments screamed. Compasses spun. GPS showed impossible coordinates. The crew stumbled, their inner ears reporting conflicting gravitational vectors as local space-time became uncertain about which direction was down.

But Takahashi stood steady. The Changed could navigate this. Their enhanced perception showed them the underlying mathematics, let them see through the fracture to the stable geometry beneath. Where humans experienced chaos, the Changed perceived pattern.

*The thin place is spreading* Takahashi reported. *Radius approximately fifty kilometers and growing. Reality inside the zone is... unstable. Laws of physics are becoming suggestions.*

The network verified. Through various nodes positioned around the Pacific, they could sense the fracture zone expanding. Like a bubble of wrongness growing in the fabric of space-time. Where it touched, reality became permeable. Dimensions bled together. Causality loosened its grip.

Inside the fracture zone, humans went mad.

The ship's crew—except Takahashi—collapsed. Their brains couldn't process the contradictory sensory input. Couldn't reconcile seeing water flow upward while feeling gravity pull down. Couldn't understand geometry that folded through impossible angles.

Some screamed. Some catatonic. One jumped overboard, preferring drowning to experiencing reality breakdown.

*We need to extract them* Takahashi thought to the network.

*No* Sera countered. *The fracture will collapse in six hours. They'll survive if they stay unconscious. Interference will only cause more damage.*

*They're suffering—*

*They're human. Suffering is inevitable for consciousness that can't adapt.*

Harsh. True. The network processed this, weighing compassion against pragmatism, and found compassion meaningless when reality itself was fragmenting.

Over the next three days, seventeen more fracture zones appeared worldwide. Antarctica. The Sahara. Siberia. The Amazon. Each one a bubble where normal physics failed and the thin place leaked through. Each one expanding at predictable rates, following mathematical patterns the Changed could perceive but humans could only fear.

Inside the fracture zones, reality became fluid. Objec ts existed in superposition states—simultaneously solid and liquid, present and absent. Time flowed in multiple directions. Light refracted through dimensions that shouldn't exist. Gravity became directional instead of universal.

The Changed entered the zones without difficulty. Moved through impossible geometries with Stage Three perception guiding them. Could exist in spaces where up and down were relative, where cause could follow effect, where matter was more suggestion than certainty.

But humans who entered the fracture zones—explorers, scientists, military personnel—couldn't function. Their brains required consistent physics. Needed solid objects to stay solid. Needed time to flow linearly. Needed cause to precede effect.

The fractures drove them insane within minutes.

*The split is accelerating* Marcus observed through the network. *World is dividing into Changed zones and human zones. Stable reality versus permeable reality.*

*How long until fractures merge?* David asked.

Sera's temporal perception calculated. *Four months. At current expansion rate, fracture zones will overlap. Eventually the entire planetary surface will exist in thin-place conditions.*

*What happens to humans then?*

*They confine themselves to increasingly small stable zones. Or they Change. Or they die.*

The network fell silent, processing this. One thousand four hundred seventeen Changed minds—their number had grown as more individuals sought voluntary exposure after seeing reports of the fractures—considering the fate of the seven billion humans who couldn't adapt.

*Should we help them?* Chen asked. *Warn them? Something?*

*We've been warning them since the first dream* Sera replied. *They chose to call us insane rather than listen.*

*Not all of them—*

*Enough of them. Majority consensus was we're diseased. Broken. Too dangerous to live. Reeves tried to kill us. They made their choice.*

Adrian watched through the network as another fracture opened—this one over London. The Thames bent upward, flowing vertically for three hundred meters before splashing back down on itself. Big Ben's tower existed in two locations simultaneously, superpositioned across probabilistic space. Pedestrians scattered screaming as reality became negotiable.

The Changed in London moved through the fracture with ease. Could walk up vertical water. Could navigate superpositioned architecture. Could exist in moments where past and future overlapped.

They were becoming native to the thin places.

Humanity was not.

News coverage showed the fractures from outside—reporters standing at the boundaries, filming the impossible geometries beyond. Scientists attempted analysis, their instruments failing, their theories inadequate. World governments issued emergency protocols, evacuation orders, statements about ongoing research into "localized reality distortions."

No one said the truth: reality was breaking down because something from beyond reality was approaching.

Except the Changed knew. Had known for months. Were the only consciousness on Earth that could perceive what was coming and understand it.

*Reeves is planning something* a node near Pentagon reported. *Intercepted military communications. They're accelerating a weapons program. Project Threshold. Designed to destroy Voyager before it gets closer.*

*It won't work* Sera said with certainty. *I've seen that timeline. Weapons pass through the probe without affecting it. The thin place isn't physical. Can't be destroyed with explosives.*

*Will Reeves survive the attempt?*

Sera's consciousness flickered through futures. *No. He leads the strike personally. The thin place around Voyager tears his ship apart. He dies believing he failed.*

*Should we warn him?*

*Why? He wouldn't listen. Would think it's Changed propaganda.*

*Because it's murder to let him fly into certain death?*

*It's consequence. We're not obligated to save humans from their own inadequate understanding.*

The network debated this. Found itself divided—some nodes retaining enough human conscience to want to prevent Reeves's death, others too far transformed to care about individual human survival.

Adrian found himself in the former category. Barely. Some tiny remnant of the person he'd been thought that letting Reeves die without warning was wrong.

But that remnant was very small and getting smaller.

*I'll try* he thought to the network. *Send message through Dr. Okonkwo. She might convince him.*

*Waste of effort* Sera observed. *But harmless. Do as you choose.*

Adrian composed the message carefully. Routed it through encrypted channels to Dr. Okonkwo's personal system. Explained that Reeves's planned strike would fail. That Voyager couldn't be destroyed. That he would die trying.

Then he waited to see if she would pass the warning along.

Meanwhile, the fractures spread.

By week's end, twenty-three zones existed worldwide. Each one expanding. Each one making reality increasingly negotiable. Humans evacuated from affected areas, creating refugee crises as populations fled zones where physics failed.

The Changed moved in.

Occupied the fracture zones with ease. Made homes in impossible geometries. Existed comfortably in spaces where gravity was optional and time flowed sideways.

The planet was segregating itself. Humans in stable zones. Changed in fracture zones. The division wasn't hostile—wasn't violent. Just inevitable. Like oil and water separating. Like evolution sorting populations into compatible environments.

*This is what Voyager brings* Sera explained to the network. *Not invasion. Not destruction. Just... option. Reality becomes permeable. Consciousness either adapts or doesn't. No malice. No intention. Just physics playing out in more dimensions than humans can perceive.*

Adrian stood at Green Bank, feeling the nearest fracture zone—thirty miles northeast and growing closer. Could sense its approach like pressure before a storm. In a month, maybe less, it would reach the observatory.

Then they'd live in the thin places permanently.

Then they'd discover what existence felt like when reality stopped being solid.

The Changed were ready.

Humanity was not.

And in the spaces between, Voyager approached, pulling the thin places with it, bringing transformation or extinction to a world that had built it forty years ago and sent it out with messages of peace and hope.

Now it returned with something else entirely.

Truth.

And truth, as the Changed had learned, was beautiful and terrible and utterly indifferent to whether anyone survived its revelation.

The fractures spread.

The Changed adapted.

The humans fled.

And the world, slowly and inexorably, broke into pieces.
