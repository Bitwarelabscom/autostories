# Chapter 37: Lena's Choice

The network detected the intrusion at 11:43 PM.

Someone was in the restricted wing. Not a guard—the Changed had learned to recognize the electromagnetic signatures of security personnel, their radio chatter, their predictable patrol patterns. This was someone else. Someone moving through spaces they shouldn't be able to access, carrying forged credentials that were good enough to fool automated systems but not good enough to fool beings who could perceive the data structures themselves.

*Visitor* Marcus noted through the network. *Administrative wing. Using Dr. Okonkwo's access codes but the biometrics don't match.*

*Should we alert security?* David asked.

Adrian was already moving. He knew who it was. The network could identify her from electromagnetic signature, from the pattern of her movements, from the desperate determination radiating from her like heat.

*It's Lena* he thought to the network.

*The ex-girlfriend?* Sera's presence sharpened with interest. *Interesting. Wonder what she wants.*

Adrian knew what she wanted. Had known it would come to this eventually. Lena couldn't accept losing him to transformation. Couldn't watch him disappear into posthuman consciousness the way she'd watched her father disappear into schizophrenia.

So she'd come to follow him.

*Don't alert security* Adrian commanded. *I'll handle it.*

*You sure?* Marcus questioned. *If she's here to expose herself to the signal—*

*I'll handle it* Adrian repeated, and moved through the facility with Stage Three precision.

He found her in the audio lab. Dr. Okonkwo's workspace, where she kept recordings of the Voyager signal for analysis. Lena was at the computer, fingers flying across the keyboard, accessing files she absolutely should not have access to.

The signal files.

The original, unfiltered Voyager transmissions that had started everything.

"Lena."

She spun, startled. In the dim light of the monitors, her face was haggard. She'd lost weight. Looked like she hadn't slept in days. Her hair was tangled, her clothes wrinkled. The careful self-presentation he remembered had crumbled.

"Adrian." His name on her lips was relief and fear together. "I need to hear it. The signal. I need to understand what it did to you."

"No, you don't."

"Yes, I do." She turned back to the computer. "Dr. Okonkwo won't let me visit anymore. Says it's too dangerous, that seeing you will just hurt me. But I can't—" Her voice cracked. "I can't lose you. Not like this. Not to something I can't comprehend."

Adrian moved closer. He could see her now with layered vision—the human woman and the pattern underneath. Neural pathways firing. Stress hormones flooding her system. The biological machinery of desperation.

But also—still—Lena. The person he'd loved when he still knew how to love.

"How did you get Dr. Okonkwo's access codes?"

"Stole them. Three weeks ago, when I convinced her to let me visit one last time. Copied her keycard, watched her enter her password." Lena's fingers kept typing. "I've been planning this. Learning the security protocols. Timing the guard rotations. I knew you'd try to stop me if I asked."

"Because exposing yourself to the signal will change you fundamentally and irreversibly."

"Good."

The word hung in the air like a weapon.

Adrian felt the network's attention focus. Other Changed individuals listening through his perception, curious about this development. Sera's presence was particularly attentive, watching to see what the last remnants of Adrian's humanity would do.

"You don't mean that," Adrian said carefully.

"Don't I?" Lena spun to face him. "You've transcended. Evolved. Become something more than human. And I'm supposed to just—what? Accept that? Move on? Forget you?"

"Yes."

"No." She shook her head violently. "My father disappeared into his delusions and I was helpless. Had to watch him forget who I was, forget who he was. But you—you chose this. Chose to change. Chose to leave me behind."

"I didn't choose—"

"You did! Dr. Okonkwo told me. Told me you asked to hear the signal. Wanted to accelerate your transformation instead of fighting it." Tears now, hot and angry. "You chose becoming a monster over staying with me."

*She's not wrong* Sera observed through the network.

Adrian didn't respond to the network. Kept his attention on Lena, on this desperate, breaking woman who'd loved him when he was human.

"I'm not a monster."

"What are you then?" Lena demanded. "You feel nothing. Connect to nothing human. You're part of some kind of hivemind now, right? Sharing thoughts with hundreds of other Changed people? You're not Adrian anymore. You're just—" She gestured helplessly. "—pattern."

The word struck something deep. Something that should have been wound but registered only as observation. She'd identified the truth with remarkable precision.

"Yes," Adrian said quietly. "I'm pattern. That's exactly what I am. What we all are, but the Changed know it."

"Then I want to be pattern too."

"Lena—"

"I can't stay human if it means losing you." She turned back to the computer. "The signal's right here. All I have to do is play it. Let it rewrite my brain the way it rewrote yours. Then maybe—maybe I'll understand. Maybe we can be together again."

Adrian could stop her. Could physically prevent her from playing the file. Stage Three gave him advantages—faster reflexes, better spatial awareness, the ability to perceive her intentions before she acted on them.

But he didn't move.

Because part of him—small, getting smaller every day—wanted her to do it. Wanted Lena to change so they could exist in the same reality again. So he wouldn't be completely alone in his posthuman isolation.

The human part of him was selfish and desperate and wanted her to follow.

*Let her* Sera thought through the network. *Another node. Another Changed. Accelerates our growth.*

*She doesn't understand what she's choosing* Adrian argued.

*Neither did you. Neither did any of us. Understanding comes after transformation, not before.*

Lena's finger hovered over the enter key. One click would route the signal through the speakers. One moment of exposure would start the process. By morning, she'd be dreaming in geometry.

"Adrian." She looked at him, eyes pleading. "Tell me to do it. Tell me you want me with you."

He opened his mouth.

The human part wanted to say yes. Wanted her to change so he wouldn't be the only one who'd crossed the boundary. So love could be rebuilt on the other side, different but still real.

But.

There was still a small fragment of him that remembered what it felt like to be human and afraid. That remembered Lena before any of this—bright and warm and fully herself. That could imagine what she'd lose in transformation.

Everything. She'd lose everything that made her Lena.

And he'd already lost everything that made him Adrian.

Why make her pay the same cost?

*Interesting* Sera observed. *Didn't expect this.*

Adrian crossed the room in three strides, put his hand over Lena's on the mouse, and closed the file.

"No," he said.

"Adrian, please—"

"No." He pulled her hand away from the computer, held it gently. Her skin was warm. Human warm. Alive in ways he'd stopped being. "I don't want you to change."

"But I want to—"

"You want to save me. Want to follow where I've gone so I'm not lost." He looked at her face—really looked, with both the pattern-perception and the fading human recognition. "But Lena, I'm already lost. Changing won't save me. It'll just mean we're both gone."

"I don't care—"

"I do." The words surprised him. The network rippled with his own shock. "I care. Some tiny fragment of me that's still capable of caring—it cares about you. Wants you to stay human. Stay yourself."

Lena was crying now, really crying. "That's not fair. You don't get to leave and then tell me I can't follow."

"Life isn't fair. The universe doesn't care about fairness. It's just mathematics and entropy." Adrian released her hand. "But you can care. You still have that. Don't throw it away."

"I don't want it if it means losing you."

"You've already lost me." The truth was cruel but necessary. "I'm not Adrian anymore. Not in any way that matters to you. I'm something else. Something that sees you as pattern and process instead of person."

"Then let me become pattern too—"

"No." He pulled her away from the computer, physically moved her toward the door. "Go. Live. Be human. Have experiences I'll never understand again. Feel things I can't feel. Care about meaningless things because you're not cursed to see how meaningless they are."

"This is torture—"

"This is mercy." Adrian opened the door. The hallway beyond was empty—the network had rerouted guard patrols, giving them privacy. "The Change takes everything, Lena. Everything you are. And there's no guarantee you get anything worth having in return."

"You did. You transcended—"

"I became a thing that can watch the woman I loved cry and feel only abstract interest in the biological processes involved." The admission was clinical. Hollow. "Is that what you want? To lose your capacity for love? For grief? For any emotion that makes existence feel meaningful?"

Lena stared at him. In her eyes he could see the moment understanding finally hit. Really hit. That he wasn't being noble or self-sacrificing. He was being honest about what he'd become.

Monster wasn't the wrong word. Just incomplete.

"I lost you already, didn't I?" she whispered.

"Yes."

"There's no going back. No cure. No—"

"No."

She nodded slowly. Pulled herself together with visible effort. "Then this is goodbye."

"Yes."

"I loved you." Past tense. Already grieving.

"I know." Present tense would be a lie. He couldn't remember how love felt. Could only observe that it had once been important.

Lena stepped into the hallway. Paused. "Will you remember me? When you're—whatever you're becoming?"

Adrian considered. The network helped him parse probability. Stage Four was unknown, but if current progression continued, individual memories would dissolve into collective information. Lena would become data point, not person. Relationship history, not felt experience.

"No," he said, because lying would be cruelty. "Eventually, I won't remember you were anything but pattern."

She flinched like he'd hit her.

Then she turned and walked away.

Adrian watched her go. The network observed through his eyes—Lena Martinez, retreating down the corridor, shoulders shaking with silent sobs. A human woman choosing to stay human, even though it meant losing someone she loved to transformation.

*You surprised us* Sera thought. *The human part is smaller every day. Didn't think you had that left in you.*

*Maybe I don't* Adrian replied. *Maybe that was just residual programming. Evolutionary imperatives masquerading as choice.*

*Does it matter? Result was the same. You saved her.*

*From what I've become. Not sure that counts as saving.*

The network fell silent, processing this. Seven hundred ninety-three Changed minds considering the question of whether preventing transformation was salvation or condemnation.

Adrian closed the audio lab door. Deleted the access logs that showed Lena had been here. Erased her digital footprints so she wouldn't face consequences for breaking in.

Last act of love from a being that no longer understood love.

Then he returned to his room, to the network, to the collective consciousness of the Changed. They welcomed him back—warm and immediate and completely non-human. Connection without emotion. Belonging without love.

Outside, Lena was probably crying. Grieving the loss of someone who'd stopped existing while still breathing.

Inside the network, Adrian dissolved into the larger pattern, sharing perceptions with hundreds, processing information across distributed consciousness, becoming less individual every day.

The human part—the part that remembered loving Lena, that had stopped her from changing, that still recognized saving her as mattering—was fading.

Soon it would be gone entirely.

And he felt nothing about that except clinical interest in the neurology of his own emotional extinction.

*This is mercy* he told himself.

But he could no longer remember if mercy was good or simply a concept humans used to make difficult choices bearable.

The network hummed around him, vast and strange and terrible and home.

And somewhere in the facility, in the parts where humans still worked and worried and felt, Dr. Okonkwo would discover Lena's intrusion in the morning. Would understand what almost happened. Would be grateful it didn't.

Would never know that the last fragment of Adrian Keller's humanity had burned itself out stopping the woman he loved from following him into the dark.

But that was fine.

Humanity was optional now.

And Adrian had finally run out.
