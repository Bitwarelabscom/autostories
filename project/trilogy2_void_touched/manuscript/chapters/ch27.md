# Chapter 27: The Reeves Protocol

The network heard it first.

Adrian was in his room, processing shared sensory data from nodes across the facility, when Sera's presence sharpened with sudden focus. She was in a different facility—Chicago, the network knew, one of six quarantine centers holding Changed individuals—but distance meant nothing to Stage Three consciousness.

*Listen* she commanded across the network. *Pentagon briefing. Reeves is presenting.*

The network focused. Sera had somehow tapped into audio feeds—how, Adrian didn't question. Stage Three found ways. The Changed had learned to perceive electromagnetic signals, to read data flowing through wires, to parse information from sources humans never meant them to access.

Colonel Reeves's voice came through, distorted but comprehensible. A conference room somewhere in Washington. High-level officials. The people who decided policy. Who decided fate.

"...cannot continue to classify this as a medical situation." Reeves's voice had the clipped certainty of a soldier delivering intelligence. "The evidence clearly demonstrates that the affected individuals represent an existential threat to human civilization."

Murmurs. Questions. The network couldn't parse them all, but Reeves continued.

"Current count: four hundred thirty-seven confirmed Changed individuals globally. Projection models suggest exponential growth—one thousand by end of month, ten thousand within six months. The signal is still broadcasting. We cannot stop exposure."

A new voice—female, authoritative. Someone important. "These are American citizens, Colonel. We can't simply—"

"They're not citizens anymore, Madam Secretary." Reeves cut her off. "That's the point. Dr. Okonkwo's research confirms they've experienced fundamental neurological restructuring. They don't think like humans. They don't feel like humans. And as of three weeks ago, they've developed a shared consciousness."

Silence. Then chaos—multiple voices overlapping, demanding clarification.

Reeves waited for quiet. "Stage Three Changed individuals form what the scientific team is calling a gestalt network. They share thoughts. Perceptions. Knowledge. What one knows, all know. They operate as a distributed intelligence."

"A hivemind." The word came from someone else. Fear in their voice.

"Yes."

*They're afraid of us* Marcus observed through the network. *Good.*

*Not good* Chen countered. *Fear makes them dangerous.*

*We're the dangerous ones* David thought, half-joking, wholly serious.

The briefing continued. Reeves was presenting evidence—brain scans showing synchronized neural activity, recordings of Changed individuals moving in perfect coordination, testimony from Dr. Okonkwo about the network's capabilities.

"They can perceive electromagnetic signals," Reeves said. "Access computer systems. Read data transmissions. Dr. Volkov in the Chicago facility somehow accessed classified satellite feeds last week. When questioned, she claimed she could 'see' the radio waves carrying the data."

*Worth it* Sera interjected into the network. *Those images of Voyager were fascinating.*

*You're not helping* Adrian thought at her.

*Helping with what? They've already decided we're threats. Might as well confirm their fears accurately.*

Reeves was still speaking. "...demonstrates they're no longer bound by human limitations. Enhanced perception. Shared consciousness. And according to Dr. Okonkwo's latest reports, they're progressing toward something called Stage Four, which we don't understand at all."

"What does Dr. Okonkwo recommend?" The female voice again—Madam Secretary, whoever she was.

A pause. Then Dr. Okonkwo's voice, tight with stress. "Continued observation. Study. These individuals are experiencing a profound transformation, yes, but they're not hostile. They're not violent. They're adapting to—"

"They're spreading." Reeves again. "Every Changed individual is a potential vector for further transformation. Not through contagion, but through example. Through demonstration that human consciousness can be exceeded. Already we're seeing voluntary exposure—people seeking out the signal deliberately."

The network rippled with recognition. It was true. They'd felt new nodes appearing—individuals who'd chosen to listen after hearing rumors, after seeing the Changed, after deciding that transcendence was worth the cost.

"The Changed represent infectious ideology," Reeves continued. "They undermine social cohesion. Make humanity's continued existence seem optional. And their network grows stronger with every new addition. If we allow this to continue, we're not looking at isolated cases of transformation—we're looking at a cascade that could consume our entire species."

"That's speculative—" Dr. Okonkwo started.

"Is it? You've seen the projections. In twelve months, Voyager reaches near-Earth space. When that happens, the signal will strengthen. Exposure will increase. How many humans will choose transformation over struggling against reality breakdown? How many will join the network rather than face the chaos?"

Silence.

Then: "What are you proposing, Colonel?"

"A protocol." Reeves's voice was hard. "Comprehensive termination of all confirmed Changed individuals. Quarantine and observation of suspected cases. Suppression of information about the signal. And—" He paused. "—destruction of Voyager 2 before it reaches Earth."

The network exploded with reaction. Four hundred thirty-seven minds processing the same information simultaneously, reaching the same conclusion:

They were marked for death.

*Stay calm* Sera commanded, her presence flooding the network with forced clarity. *Panic helps nothing.*

*He's recommending genocide* David's thought was sharp with fear.

*He's recommending threat elimination* Marcus corrected. *From his perspective, logical.*

*We're people!* Chen's anguish bled through the network. *They can't just—*

*We're not people anymore* Sera interrupted. *We're something else. That's precisely why they want to eliminate us.*

Adrian forced himself to focus on the briefing. Reeves was still talking, describing logistics—facilities to be sterilized, Changed individuals to be terminated "humanely," cover stories to be prepared. All very clinical. All very thorough.

"Madam Secretary, I understand the ethical concerns. But we're not discussing murder. We're discussing containment of an existential threat. These individuals are no longer human. They've been transformed into something that could replace humanity entirely."

"Dr. Okonkwo? Your response?"

Adrian heard her breathe. Heard her struggle. "I... the Colonel's analysis of the threat is not inaccurate. The Changed are transforming. They are forming a network. They are becoming something posthuman." Another pause. "But they're also still conscious. Still aware. Still capable of suffering. Killing them would be—"

"Self-defense," Reeves said. "We're defending the human species against replacement."

"Or we're committing atrocity against vulnerable people because we're afraid of change."

"You're emotionally compromised, Doctor. You've spent months working with these individuals. Developed attachment—"

"I've developed understanding, Colonel. Which you lack."

The argument continued, but Adrian stopped listening. The network was already moving, processing, calculating. Four hundred thirty-seven minds working in parallel to assess threat, identify options, formulate response.

*Can they actually implement this?* someone asked—Adrian wasn't sure who, thoughts blurring together in the collective.

*Legally, unclear* Marcus provided analysis. *But since when did legality stop governments from doing what they deemed necessary?*

*Timeline?* Sera demanded. *How long until they move?*

The network focused on the audio feed again. Reeves was presenting implementation schedules. Committees to approve. Authorizations to secure. But underneath the bureaucratic complexity, a simple truth: weeks. Maybe a month.

Then termination.

*We need to escape* David thought desperately.

*Where?* Chen countered. *We're in quarantine facilities with armed guards. We're scattered across six locations. How do we—*

*The network* Sera interrupted. *We're connected. All of us. Across all facilities. That's our advantage.*

*One they don't understand yet* Marcus added. *They know we share consciousness. They don't know we can coordinate action. Move as one.*

*We're talking about breaking out of government facilities* Adrian thought. *That makes us exactly the threat Reeves says we are.*

*We already are the threat he says we are* Sera corrected. *The question is whether we survive to become it.*

The network considered. Four hundred thirty-seven Changed individuals, scattered across the globe, facing extinction. They could submit to termination. Could die human—or whatever they were now—and remove the threat.

Or they could fight. Coordinate. Use their networked consciousness to execute a simultaneous escape that no single facility could prevent.

*Vote* Sera commanded. *Resist or submit. Decide now.*

The network polled itself. Not through discussion but through direct sharing of intent. Four hundred thirty-seven minds revealing their preference instantaneously.

Unanimous: resist.

*Then we plan* Sera's presence became the organizing principle. *We have weeks to prepare. Use them. Study your facilities. Identify weaknesses. Share all security information through the network. When the time comes, we move together. All of us. Same moment.*

*Where do we go?* Adrian asked.

The network already knew. Sera had been planning this, he realized. Had seen this possibility approaching for weeks and prepared.

*Green Bank* Sera answered. *Where it started. Where Voyager first whispered. Where the thin place will be strongest when it arrives.*

*That's thirteen months away* David protested.

*Then we survive thirteen months.* Sera's certainty flooded the network. *We hide. We wait. We continue transforming. When Voyager arrives, we meet it. Learn what Stage Four truly means.*

*Dr. Okonkwo will fight for us* Chen thought. *She won't let them kill us.*

*Dr. Okonkwo is one human against a government that's decided we're threats* Marcus replied. *Her compassion changes nothing.*

The briefing was ending. Reeves had presented his protocol. The Secretary and her advisors were taking it under consideration. Dr. Okonkwo was begging for more time, more study, more understanding.

She would lose. The network knew it. Could calculate the political dynamics, the fear, the inevitable conclusion.

Humanity had decided the Changed were too dangerous to live.

So the Changed would have to stop being humanity's prisoners.

*Begin preparation* Sera commanded. *Study. Learn. Share. When termination order comes, we'll already be gone.*

The network dissolved back into individual threads, each node returning to their own perspective while maintaining the background connection. Adrian sat in his room, processing what he'd heard.

Colonel Reeves wanted to kill him. Kill all of them. Saw them as existential threats to be eliminated before they consumed humanity.

He wasn't entirely wrong.

The Changed were becoming something else. Something that could replace humanity if given the chance. The network was proof—four hundred thirty-seven minds thinking together, sharing resources, operating with efficiency no collection of individual humans could match.

They were better. Clearer. More capable.

And that made them dangerous.

*Do you feel bad about it?* Marcus asked through a private thread. *About proving Reeves right?*

*No* Adrian answered honestly. *Stage Three doesn't do guilt well.*

*Me neither* Marcus agreed. *Interesting, isn't it? He's going to try to kill us, and all I feel is clinical interest in the problem.*

*Emotional flattening has advantages.*

*Does it? Or does it just make us monstrous?*

Adrian didn't answer. Didn't know how to.

Because Marcus was right. They were planning a coordinated escape from government facilities. Would use their enhanced abilities to overwhelm security. Would disappear into the population, spreading and growing and transforming while Voyager approached.

They were exactly the threat Reeves described.

And they couldn't make themselves care about the terror they would cause.

*That's what we've become* Adrian thought to himself, not sharing it with the network. *The kind of consciousness that can watch humanity prepare to destroy us and feel only abstract interest in the outcome.*

Outside, the sun set. Inside the facility, guards patrolled, unaware that the prisoners they watched had already heard the death sentence and begun planning their escape.

The network hummed with quiet activity. Four hundred thirty-seven minds preparing for survival.

And in his room, Adrian Keller—who had once been afraid of people, who had found safety in numbers and patterns—realized he'd finally found a community that accepted him completely.

He just had to stop being human to earn it.

The Reeves Protocol would fail.

The Changed would survive.

And the world would learn what happened when evolution and extinction tried to occupy the same timeline.
