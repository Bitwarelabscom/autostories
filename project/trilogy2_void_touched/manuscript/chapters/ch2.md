# Chapter 2: Pattern Recognition

Adrian didn't go back to work the next day. Or the day after that.

He told himself it was responsible—call in sick, avoid contaminating others with whatever was happening to him. But responsibility was a lie he told to justify what he was really doing: staring at the walls. At the patterns. At the impossible mathematics his sleeping hands had inscribed.

The apartment had always been minimal. Now it was a monument to geometric obsession.

He'd photographed everything on the second day, documenting the bedroom walls with clinical precision. Seventy-three photographs from every angle, each one carefully labeled, timestamped, filed in nested folders organized by wall surface and pattern density. The data suggested extensive coverage: approximately 847 square feet of surface area, 94% of which showed some form of mathematical notation.

But photographs weren't enough. They were flat, two-dimensional representations of something that existed in more dimensions than that. Looking at the photos was like trying to understand music by reading wavelength measurements.

So he stayed. And looked. And tried to understand.

The patterns weren't static. That was the first thing he noticed on day three, around 2:47 AM, when he hadn't slept despite the exhaustion that made his bones ache. The equations on the north wall—the ones describing non-Euclidean transformations—had shifted slightly. Not physically. The marker ink hadn't moved. But the meaning had changed, like words that rearrange themselves when you look away.

Or he was losing his mind.

Objectively speaking, that was the more probable explanation. Schizophrenia could present with visual hallucinations, mathematical obsessions, sleep disruption. He pulled up diagnostic criteria on his laptop, checked symptoms against his own experience. Delusions of reference: seeing special meaning in ordinary things. Disorganized thinking. Bizarre behavior.

All present. All documented.

His phone buzzed. Dr. Patterson again: *Adrian, we need you to respond. Are you all right? Should we send someone to check on you?*

He stared at the message. The letters had texture—small, angular, worried. He could feel Patterson's concern radiating through the phone screen like heat.

That wasn't possible. Text messages didn't have emotional content you could physically sense.

He typed back: *Taking personal time. Will return next week.*

The lie tasted metallic. He didn't know if he'd ever go back.

His workstation sat in the corner, three monitors dark, judging him with their blank screens. He'd been avoiding it. Avoiding the encrypted files containing the Voyager signal. As if not looking would make it less real. Make the dreams stop. Make his hands stop cramping from the phantom memory of drawing all night.

But avoidance wasn't understanding. And Adrian Keller needed to understand.

He queued up the signal at 3:13 AM—the time had become significant somehow, mathematical synchronicity he couldn't explain. Put on his noise-canceling headphones. Let the pattern wash through him.

It was worse than he remembered.

No—not worse. More. The signal had layers he hadn't perceived before. Nested frequencies carrying information in their ratios, in the spaces between pulses. It was beautiful in a way that hurt, like staring at the sun. His enhanced pattern recognition—when had it become enhanced?—picked apart the structure with ruthless efficiency.

There. A mathematical proof encoded in the cadence. And there, a geometric transformation described by frequency modulation. The signal wasn't random noise from a dead probe. It was language. Communication. A message.

But from what? From whom?

The questions dissolved as he listened. His hands began moving without conscious instruction, reaching for the pencil he didn't remember picking up, the notebook that had appeared on his desk. He was drawing. Translating. Converting the audio patterns into visual mathematics.

Time became uncertain. Minutes or hours passed. His hand cramped, released, kept moving. The notebook filled with equations. Then another notebook. Then he was writing on the desk itself when paper ran out, marker ink flowing from somewhere, covering the wood grain with geometric precision.

When awareness returned—surfacing like a diver breaching from deep water—sunlight was streaming through his window. 7:42 AM. He'd been listening for over four hours.

The desk was covered in mathematics. His hand ached. And he understood things he hadn't understood before.

The signal was teaching him. Rewiring his neural architecture to perceive patterns human brains weren't designed to process. Each exposure created new pathways, new connections, new capabilities. He was becoming a receiver tuned to frequencies beyond normal human cognition.

This should terrify him. Objectively speaking, unexplained neurological changes suggested serious pathology. But the fear was distant, analytical. What he felt instead was curiosity. Hunger. The desperate need to understand more.

His phone showed seventeen missed calls. Three voicemails. Multiple texts from colleagues, from Patterson, from—

His breath caught. Three texts from Lena.

*Adrian? Dr. Patterson called me. He's worried about you.*

*I know we're not together anymore but please just let me know you're ok*

*I'm coming over*

The timestamp on the last message: 7:15 AM. Twenty-seven minutes ago.

Adrian looked at his apartment. The bedroom walls covered in impossible mathematics. The desk transformed into a geometric manifesto. His own appearance—he caught sight of himself in the bathroom mirror, gaunt and hollow-eyed, marker stains on his hands that looked like stigmata.

He looked like someone in the grip of psychosis. He looked exactly like someone Lena would try to save.

The knock came at 7:56 AM. Soft but insistent.

"Adrian? It's me. I know you're in there."

He stood frozen. Every instinct screamed to hide the walls, cover the desk, pretend normalcy. But his limbs felt heavy, unresponsive. The exhaustion was catching up, dragging him down.

"Adrian, please. I just need to know you're alive."

His hand moved to the door. Opened it.

Lena stood in the hallway wearing weekend clothes—jeans, soft gray sweater, her hair loose around her shoulders. She looked beautiful in the same way she always had, mathematical ratios of facial symmetry that human evolution had programmed him to find attractive. But she also looked worried. Tired. Like she'd been up all night too.

"Thank god." She stepped forward, and he moved back automatically, maintaining distance. She noticed. Her eyes flickered with hurt. "Can I come in?"

"I'm fine. You didn't need to—"

"Patterson said you haven't responded to any official communications. That you've been out for four days. He was about to call a welfare check."

"I'm taking personal time."

"In your apartment? Alone? Adrian, that's not—" She stopped, her gaze moving past him into the visible living room. Her expression changed. "What's all over your desk?"

"Notes. Research."

"It looks like..." She stepped past him, moving into the apartment before he could stop her. Her footsteps were too loud, each one a small percussion that made his enhanced hearing flinch. She reached the desk, touched the marker-covered surface. "What is this?"

"Mathematical notation. Pattern analysis."

"From the signals?" She turned to face him. "Adrian, you said you reported those. You said the government took over."

"They did. This is... separate."

"Separate how?"

He couldn't answer. Couldn't explain that he'd copied the files, that he'd been listening repeatedly, that the signal had gotten inside his head and was rewriting him from the inside out.

Lena was moving through the apartment now, her worry escalating to alarm. She reached the bedroom door, pushed it open.

Stopped.

The silence stretched for five seconds. Ten. Adrian counted them, watching her face process what she was seeing. The walls covered floor to ceiling in geometric forms. The mathematics that shouldn't exist. The evidence of obsessive, compulsive madness.

When she turned back to him, her face had gone pale.

"How long?" Her voice was carefully controlled.

"What?"

"How long have you been doing this? Writing on the walls?"

"I didn't write them. I drew them. While sleeping."

"Adrian." She said his name like a prayer or a curse. "Do you hear yourself?"

"I know how it sounds."

"Do you?" She stepped closer, and he could see tears forming in her eyes. "Because it sounds like my father. When he was getting bad. When the schizophrenia—" Her voice cracked. "You're having a psychotic break."

"I'm not psychotic."

"You drew all over your walls while sleeping and you don't think that's—"

"It's not psychosis if it's real."

"Real." She laughed, hollow and broken. "Adrian, please listen to me. These patterns, these signals—they're not real. Or they're real but you're having a pathological response. We need to get you help."

"There's no help for this."

"Yes, there is. There are medications, treatments. My father—"

"I'm not your father, Lena."

The words came out harsher than he intended. She flinched as if struck. The air between them crystallized into something fragile and sharp.

"No," she said quietly. "You're not. My father fought his delusions. He tried to stay present, stay connected, even when his brain was lying to him about reality." She gestured at the walls. "You're wallowing in this. Encouraging it."

"I'm trying to understand it."

"Understand what? Mathematical graffiti?" She moved to the nearest wall, traced one of the equations with her finger. "This doesn't mean anything, Adrian. It's just your brain misfiring, creating patterns where there aren't any."

"Those patterns are consistent across multiple—"

He stopped. He'd almost said "multiple people." Almost revealed that others were experiencing the same thing. That would make it worse—not shared truth, but shared delusion. Folie à plusieurs.

Lena was watching him with those too-perceptive eyes. "Multiple what?"

"Nothing."

"Adrian—"

"You should go." He moved to the door, opened it. "Thank you for checking on me. But I'm fine. I just need time."

"Time to what? Destroy yourself?" She didn't move. "I watched my father disappear into his delusions. Watched him choose them over reality, over us, over everything. I can't watch you do the same thing."

"Then don't watch." His voice was flat now, emotionless. Self-protective. "We're not together anymore, Lena. You don't have to save me."

Her face crumpled. "Is that what you think? That I'm here out of obligation?"

"I think you're here because I'm exhibiting symptoms of mental illness and your trauma is triggered. I think you're trying to rescue me the way you couldn't rescue your father."

Silence. He'd struck true. He could see it in the way her shoulders fell, the way her breath caught.

"Maybe," she whispered. "Maybe you're right. Maybe this is my trauma talking." She moved to the door, stopped in the threshold. "But I also think you're using that against me. Using my history to dismiss legitimate concern. Because acknowledging that I might be right means acknowledging that you're sick."

"Or acknowledging that you can't understand what's happening to me."

She looked at him for a long moment. Something in her expression shifted—grief settling into acceptance. "Call me if you want help. Real help. Not whatever this is."

She left. The door closed with a soft click that echoed in the sudden silence.

Adrian stood in his apartment, surrounded by impossible mathematics, and tried to feel something about what had just happened. Tried to access the guilt, the regret, the complicated tangle of love and loss that should accompany watching Lena walk away.

Found only emptiness. And underneath that, relief.

She would try to stop him. Would call doctors, recommend medication, push for hospitalization. Would see his transformation as disease rather than evolution. She couldn't understand. Wouldn't understand.

Better that she was gone.

He returned to his workstation. Queued up the Voyager signal again. This time he searched for others—anyone online discussing similar experiences. Anomalous signals. Geometric dreams. Pattern recognition gone wild.

The forums were full of noise, but he knew how to filter. Knew how to find signal in static. It was what he did. What he'd always done.

What he was becoming better at every day.

By sunset, he'd found three potential matches. Users describing symptoms eerily similar to his own. Posts that had been deleted or accounts suspended. But not before he'd saved the data, traced the digital footprints.

They were out there. Others who'd heard. Others who were changing.

He just had to find them.

Adrian worked through the night, tracing patterns across the internet, finding the Changed through the mathematical signature of their obsessions. Sleep could wait. Food could wait. Everything could wait.

The signal was calling. And finally, Adrian was learning to speak its language.

Outside his apartment, the world continued its mundane rotation. Inside, surrounded by geometric truths and impossible mathematics, Dr. Adrian Keller took another step away from humanity.

And didn't look back.
