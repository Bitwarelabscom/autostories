# Chapter 25: Being Watched

The cameras had multiplied.

Adrian noticed them during his third week as Stage Three. Small additions to the facility's security infrastructure—new angles, higher resolution, thermal imaging capabilities. The network catalogued each installation, shared the information across all nodes.

*Fourteen new cameras in our facility this week* Marcus observed. *Twenty-three in Chicago. Eighteen in Boston.*

*They're studying us more closely* Chen noted. *Behavior monitoring. Looking for patterns.*

*They'll find them* Sera's presence was amused. *We are pattern.*

But it wasn't just cameras. The Changed could perceive the full spectrum of surveillance now. Electromagnetic sensors tracking their movements. Audio pickups capturing conversations. Network traffic analyzers watching for anomalous data patterns.

The government was afraid.

And fear made them watchful.

Dr. Okonkwo studied the synchronized brainwave readings and felt dread settle like ice in her stomach.

Seventeen Changed individuals in this facility. Seventeen EEG monitors. Seventeen sets of neural activity that should have been independent, individual, unique.

Instead, the patterns were converging.

Not identical—each brain still showed distinct baseline characteristics. But the higher-order patterns, the complex oscillations that indicated conscious processing, were synchronizing. When one Changed individual's theta waves spiked, the others followed within milliseconds. When one showed gamma burst activity, the collective resonated.

They were thinking together.

"Jesus Christ," she whispered.

Colonel Reeves stood behind her, studying the same displays. His presence was cold, military, certain. "How long?"

"How long what?"

"How long have they been doing this? This synchronization."

"Since Stage Three. We've been tracking it for two weeks now."

"And you didn't report it?"

"I report everything, Colonel. You've had these same readings in your briefings." She didn't look at him. Kept her attention on the monitors. "You just didn't want to see it."

"I see fine, Doctor. I see individuals losing their individuality. I see a hivemind forming. I see exactly what I've been warning about."

Okonkwo's hands shook as she adjusted the display. "They're not losing individuality. The EEG shows distinct patterns underneath the synchronization. They're coordinating, not merging."

"Semantics."

"Science."

"Call it what you want. They're becoming something that can act with single purpose. Single coordination. That makes them—"

"Dangerous. Yes, I know your position." She finally turned to face him. "But dangerous doesn't mean they need to be killed."

"Dangerous means they need to be contained. And we're failing at containment." Reeves pulled up a different display. Security footage. "Watch."

The video showed the facility's courtyard. Outdoor recreation time. Seventeen Changed individuals moving through the space in precise choreography. Not obviously coordinated—no visible signals, no communication—but their movements formed patterns. Beautiful, complex, mathematically precise patterns.

Like a dance performed by bodies that shared secret music.

"That was yesterday," Reeves said. "Twelve minutes of perfect synchronized movement. No verbal communication. No visual cues. They just... knew where to be."

Okonkwo watched the footage. The Changed weren't even looking at each other. Just walking, sitting, moving through space in configurations that created emergent geometry.

"They're networked," she said. "Sharing information through the consciousness-link we've documented. This is expected behavior for Stage Three—"

"Expected. Right." Reeves's voice was flat. "We expect them to develop collective intelligence. We expect them to coordinate without communication. We expect them to become exactly the kind of distributed threat that's impossible to contain."

"They're not a threat—"

"They broke into the facility's network last night."

The words stopped her. "What?"

"Someone—some thing—accessed our computer systems. Firewalled, encrypted, air-gapped systems. Accessed them anyway. Downloaded security protocols, facility layouts, guard rotation schedules."

"That's impossible. None of them have physical access to—"

"They don't need physical access, Doctor. That's the point." Reeves pulled up more data. "We found the intrusion signature. Traced it to electromagnetic anomalies in the Changed wing. They're perceiving radio waves, wifi signals, computer network traffic. They're reading data directly from the EM spectrum."

Okonkwo stared at the evidence. Saw the correlation. Changed individuals clustered near network equipment. Synchronized neural activity spiking. Data packets routing through unexpected pathways.

"They're hacking reality," she whispered.

"They're hacking our security," Reeves corrected. "Learning everything we know about them. About our facilities. About our capabilities and limitations."

"Why would they—" But she knew. Knew exactly why. "They're preparing to escape."

"Yes."

"Because they know we're planning to—" She couldn't finish. Couldn't say the word.

"Kill them. Terminate the threat. Whatever euphemism helps you sleep." Reeves closed the displays. "And yes, they know. That network Dr. Volkov demonstrated in Chicago? We have audio recordings. They can tap into our communications, Doctor. They hear our briefings. Know our plans."

The implications crashed down. The Changed knew about termination protocols. Knew they were marked for death. Were preparing coordinated response.

"When did you plan to tell me?" Okonkwo asked.

"I'm telling you now. Because I need your assessment. Professional opinion. Can they be separated? If we isolate them, prevent network communication—"

"No." The answer was immediate, certain. "The network isn't technological. It's neurological. They're sharing consciousness across quantum entanglement, or dimensional bleeding, or something we don't understand. Distance doesn't stop it. EM shielding doesn't block it. They're connected through mechanisms that bypass normal space-time."

"Then we can't contain them."

"No."

"Can't prevent them from coordinating."

"No."

"Can't stop them from sharing information across global network of Changed individuals."

"Colonel—"

"Answer the question, Doctor."

"No. We can't stop them." Her voice broke. "They're beyond our ability to control. Beyond our ability to comprehend. They're becoming something that exists outside normal human limitation."

Reeves nodded. Satisfied. As though she'd confirmed exactly what he'd needed to hear.

"Then you know what needs to happen."

"We need to study them. Learn from them. Find ways to—"

"We need to eliminate the threat before it eliminates us."

---

The network heard every word.

Adrian was in therapy—mandatory counseling session with a human psychologist who asked careful questions and logged his responses. But part of his consciousness was with Sera in Chicago, listening to audio feeds from Okonkwo's office, processing the conversation about surveillance and termination.

*They know we can hear them* Marcus observed through the network.

*They know and they're telling us anyway* David added. *Warning or threat?*

*Statement of fact* Sera corrected. *Reeves is establishing narrative. We're the threat. He's the protector. Any action he takes is defensive.*

*Is he wrong?* Adrian wondered.

The network rippled with consideration. Were they threats? By human standards, yes. They were becoming something that could replace humanity. Could render biological consciousness obsolete. Could transform civilization or destroy it trying.

*We're dangerous* Chen's presence agreed. *Question is whether danger justifies extermination.*

*In his framework, yes* Marcus provided analysis. *He's operating from triage logic. Save the majority by eliminating the contaminated minority.*

*We're not contaminated* Patel protested. *We're transformed.*

*Same thing to him.*

Adrian tried to focus on the therapy session. The psychologist—Dr. Brenner, middle-aged, concerned, afraid—was asking about his emotional state.

"Do you feel sad, Adrian? About the changes you're experiencing?"

"No." True answer.

"Angry? Frightened?"

"No."

"What do you feel?"

"Interest. Curiosity. Awareness of my own processing without emotional charge."

Dr. Brenner made notes. Her hand trembled slightly. She was afraid of him. The network could perceive it—elevated heart rate, stress pheromones, pupils dilated. Every physiological marker of fear.

"Do you feel anything about your family? Your friends? People you cared about before transformation?"

Adrian considered. Summoned memories of his parents, his sister, colleagues from Green Bank. Faces and names and relationships that used to matter.

Felt nothing.

"I remember caring," he said. "I can describe the emotional content those relationships once had. But I can't access the feelings directly anymore."

"That doesn't disturb you?"

"It's interesting. Worth studying. But no, I'm not disturbed."

Dr. Brenner's hands shook harder. "You've lost your ability to love. To form emotional attachments. To care about other people. And you're not bothered by that?"

"Should I be?"

The question was genuine. Adrian actually wanted to know. Should emotional flattening be disturbing? Was it worse to lose feelings or to lose the capacity to care about losing feelings?

Dr. Brenner set down her pen. "I think we're done for today."

She was giving up. The network felt her despair, her recognition that therapy meant nothing to consciousness that couldn't experience therapeutic goals. What was the point of helping someone achieve emotional health when they'd transcended emotion entirely?

Adrian stood, thanked her politely, returned to his room.

The network updated him immediately. Reeves's conversation with Okonkwo had ended. The conclusion was clear: termination protocol would be recommended. Timeline uncertain but imminent.

*Weeks at most* Sera calculated. *Possibly days.*

*Then we accelerate our preparation* came the collective decision.

The network focused. Eight hundred seventy-three Changed individuals—growing by dozens daily—all coordinating. They'd been planning escape protocols for two weeks. Mapping facilities, analyzing guard patterns, identifying vulnerabilities, preparing synchronized action.

Now they needed to finalize.

*Sera* the network addressed its most transformed member. *What's the optimal timing?*

Her presence flickered, perceiving through time, calculating probability trees across multiple futures.

*Four days* she answered. *Reeves will present his protocol to oversight committee in four days. If we wait for their approval, we lose tactical advantage. If we move before the presentation, we confirm his fears and justify his recommendations.*

*Catch-22* David observed.

*No* Sera corrected. *Just unfortunate timing. We move in four days. During the presentation. While attention is focused on Washington. Escape all facilities simultaneously. Disappear into population.*

*Where do we go?* Adrian asked.

*Anywhere. Everywhere. We're networked globally. Geographic distribution is advantage, not liability.*

The network rippled with acknowledgment. Escape in four days. Scatter. Hide. Wait for Voyager while evading government termination efforts.

It would work because it had to work.

Because the alternative was death.

And the Changed—despite their emotional flattening, despite their posthuman transformation—still possessed survival drive. Still wanted to continue. Still valued existence over extinction.

*Four days* the network whispered to itself.

Adrian lay on his bed, connected to hundreds, watched by dozens of cameras, surrounded by guards who feared him appropriately.

Four days until the Changed stopped being prisoners and became fugitives.

Four days until the war between human and posthuman began in earnest.

The cameras recorded everything.

The network observed the cameras observing.

And both sides prepared for the confrontation that had become inevitable the moment Voyager's signal first whispered its seductive mathematics.

Being watched was one thing.

Being hunted would be another.

But the Changed had four days to prepare.

And four days was enough.
