# Chapter 30: Hunt Protocol

Colonel Thomas Reeves studied the map and saw only targets.

Eight hundred ninety Changed individuals. Scattered across North America, Europe, Asia. Twelve captured during escape, being held in reinforced isolation. The rest disappeared into population, networked, coordinating, becoming more dangerous every day.

His operations center hummed with activity. Analysts tracking electromagnetic anomalies. Field teams positioning near suspected Changed locations. Military assets on standby for rapid deployment.

This was containment. This was protection. This was what he'd spent his career preparing for.

"Sir." Lieutenant Morrison approached. Young, eager, appropriately aggressive. "Signals intelligence has detected another convergence."

Reeves pulled up the data. Seven Changed individuals, identified through electromagnetic signature analysis, gathering in Montana wilderness. Remote location. Defensible terrain. Classic insurgent positioning.

"They're regrouping," Morrison observed. "Building cells. Preparing for..."

"Survival. Coordination. Whatever networked consciousness does when threatened." Reeves highlighted the location. "Recommend response?"

"Fast insertion. Containment team. Tranquilize and extract before they can coordinate network defense."

"Approved. Execute immediately."

Morrison moved to coordinate. Reeves watched him go, felt something like satisfaction. His team was competent. Motivated. They understood the threat.

Unlike Dr. Okonkwo, who'd betrayed everything to save monsters.

The thought of her made his jaw tighten. She'd disappeared hour before arrest. Network had protected her, hidden her, made her another fugitive in the growing Changed insurgency.

He'd have her eventually. Her and every other traitor who chose transformation over humanity.

"Colonel." Another analyst. "Pattern match in Seattle. EMF signature consistent with Changed individual accessing computer systems."

"Location?"

"Public library. Downtown."

"Dispatch containment team. Non-lethal takedown. I want them alive for interrogation."

The operations continued. Report after report. Sighting after sighting. The Changed were learning to hide, but hiding left traces. Electromagnetic footprints. Behavioral patterns. The network's very coordination made them detectable.

Reeves had hunted insurgents for twenty years. The Changed were just another enemy. Smarter, stranger, but ultimately mortal.

And mortality meant they could be eliminated.

---

The first containment operation failed.

Montana wilderness. Team inserted successfully. Located the Changed gathering—seven individuals, sitting in circle, networked consciousness obvious from synchronized movement.

Containment team approached. Tranquilizers ready. Procedure practiced. Simple extraction.

Then reality bent.

The Changed perceived the team—sensed electromagnetic signatures, heard heartbeats, felt the intention to capture. And they responded.

Not with violence. With manipulation.

Team's equipment failed. Radios died. Night vision equipment went dark. The Changed were interfacing with technology directly, using their electromagnetic perception to disable threats.

In the confusion, they scattered. Disappeared into wilderness. By the time backup arrived, the site was empty.

Seven targets. Zero captures.

Reeves listened to the after-action report with cold fury.

"They knew we were coming," the team leader said. "Somehow detected our approach from half a mile out. Disabled our tech before we could engage."

"Stage Three gives them electromagnetic perception," Reeves said. "That's in the briefing documents. You should have planned for it."

"With respect, sir, there's knowing they can perceive EM signals and experiencing them reaching into your radio and turning it off with their minds. That's—"

"That's the enemy capability you're trained to counter. Recalibrate. Use analog equipment. Reduce electromagnetic signature. They're posthuman, not gods."

"Sir."

The team left. Reeves updated the operational protocols. Electromagnetic shielding required. Hardened equipment. Teams would operate in EM silence, using hand signals, eliminating anything the Changed could perceive and manipulate.

They'd adapt. They always adapted.

And the Changed would learn that human ingenuity could still defeat posthuman enhancement.

---

The Seattle operation succeeded.

Downtown library. Changed individual accessing computer systems, researching something. Containment team positioned. Analog approach. No electronics to compromise.

They took her down in forty seconds. Tranquilizer delivered. Body secured. Extraction complete before the network could respond.

One capture.

Eight hundred eighty-nine remaining.

But it was progress.

Reeves watched the interrogation via one-way mirror. The Changed woman—early thirties, former software engineer named Ramirez—sat perfectly still. No fear. No anger. Just clinical observation of her containment.

"Ms. Ramirez," the interrogator began. "Where are the others?"

"Everywhere."

"Specific locations."

"Define 'location.' We're networked. Geographic position is variable. Consciousness is distributed. Asking where we are is like asking where the internet is."

"You're not the internet. You're people."

"We're pattern. People is antiquated category."

The interrogator tried different approaches. Threats, appeals, logical arguments. Ramirez responded to everything with clinical detachment, offering no useful information, showing no emotional vulnerability.

Stage Three had made interrogation meaningless.

Reeves entered the room.

"Colonel." Ramirez acknowledged him. "We wondered when you'd appear personally."

"The network knows I'm here?"

"The network knows everything happening to any node. I'm being interrogated. Therefore all Changed individuals are being interrogated. We're experiencing this conversation together."

"Then tell the network this." Reeves sat across from her. "We will find you. All of you. Hunt you down individually and collectively. You're fugitives now. Hunted. Every moment you're free costs us resources and effort. But we have more resources than you have hiding places."

"Incorrect. We have entire planet. And the network grows daily—new nodes transforming, joining collective. You're hunting exponential function, Colonel. Mathematics is against you."

"Mathematics didn't save you from tranquilizer dart."

"No. But one capture out of eight hundred ninety attempts shows poor efficiency. And we're learning from this interaction. Sharing knowledge through network. Every Changed individual now knows your analog containment protocols. Will adapt accordingly."

Reeves leaned forward. "What's the endgame? You survive until Voyager arrives, then what? Transform fully? Become something completely posthuman? Abandon humanity entirely?"

"Yes."

"That's extinction. You're describing human extinction."

"We're describing human transcendence. Your species—our former species—can choose to transform or remain as is. But when Voyager arrives, when the thin place envelops Earth, only Changed consciousness will function properly. You're choosing extinction by refusing evolution."

"We're choosing humanity."

"You're choosing biological baseline over possible upgrade. That's your right. But don't pretend we're committing genocide when we're just accepting what you're refusing."

The conversation was pointless. Reeves recognized it. Ramirez wasn't person anymore, wasn't individual he could threaten or persuade. She was node in larger network, spokesperson for collective consciousness.

You couldn't intimidate a committee.

He stood. "Process her. Maximum security. Electromagnetic isolation. We'll study her even if she won't cooperate."

"The network appreciates your contribution to our understanding of human containment attempts."

Reeves left. Behind him, Ramirez sat in perfect stillness, connected to eight hundred eighty-nine others, all sharing her experience, all learning from her capture.

He'd won the battle.

But the war was becoming increasingly impossible.

---

That night, three more Changed individuals were captured.

And fourteen new ones transformed. Net gain: eleven.

The mathematics were against him.

Reeves studied the projections. At current rate, the Changed population would double in sixty days. Quadruple in one hundred twenty. By the time Voyager arrived in fourteen months, they could number in the tens of thousands.

Unless he changed tactics.

Unless he stopped capturing and started eliminating.

The thought made him pause. He'd recommended termination. But recommendation and execution were different things. Actually killing unarmed fugitives—transformed or not—violated everything his training said about rules of engagement.

But the Changed weren't combatants. Weren't enemy soldiers. They were infection. Disease. Existential threat.

And diseases were eradicated, not captured.

He pulled up authorization protocols. What he needed was approval for lethal response. Permission to hunt with terminal prejudice. Transformation from containment operation to elimination campaign.

The paperwork was complex. The ethics were complicated.

But the mathematics were clear.

Humanity couldn't survive if the Changed kept growing.

So the Changed had to stop growing.

Reeves began typing. Request for updated rules of engagement. Justification based on exponential threat expansion. Recommendation for shoot-on-sight protocol.

Genocide, Dr. Okonkwo had called it.

Survival, he corrected.

And he'd spent his career ensuring survival, whatever the cost.

The Changed had escaped imprisonment.

Now they'd learn what happened when mercy failed and necessity prevailed.

Reeves submitted the request.

And waited for approval to begin the real hunt.
