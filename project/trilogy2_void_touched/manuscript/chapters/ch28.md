# Chapter 28: Convergence Point

*Move now* Sera commanded across the network.

The briefing had ended. Reeves had presented his protocol. Government officials were deliberating. Hours, maybe days before official approval.

But the Changed couldn't wait.

Four hundred thirty-seven minds—the number had grown since the briefing began—synchronized their intent. Escape. Now. All facilities simultaneously. Before termination orders could execute.

Adrian was in his room when the network coordinated. Felt the collective decision ripple through consciousness, felt eight hundred ninety-one nodes across six facilities align to single purpose.

*How?* someone asked. New node. Recently Changed. Still uncertain about collective action.

*Watch* Sera answered. *Learn. Participate.*

The network focused.

In West Virginia, Adrian stood. Walked to his door. Placed hand against the electronic lock and felt its circuits—electromagnetic patterns describing access control, authorization protocols, security logging.

Stage Three let him see it. Perceive it. And—experiment had shown—influence it.

He pushed. Not physically. Consciously. Focused attention on the lock's circuitry, on the specific transistors that controlled engagement. Perceived their state and willed it different.

The lock clicked open.

*Confirmation* he thought to the network. *Electronic manipulation functional.*

Across five other facilities, Changed individuals replicated the technique. Doors opening. Security checkpoints failing. Access controls yielding to concentrated posthuman awareness.

*Phase one complete* Marcus reported. *All nodes mobile.*

*Phase two* Sera ordered. *Facility systems.*

The network divided attention. Some nodes focused on movement, navigation, physical escape. Others—those with stronger electromagnetic perception—targeted infrastructure.

Adrian felt their coordination. Chen in Boston disrupting power distribution. Patel in California overwhelming fire suppression systems with false positives. David in Chicago blanking security camera feeds with electromagnetic noise.

And Sera. Sera was everywhere, her consciousness distributed across the network, coordinating, timing, ensuring synchronization.

*We're actually doing this* someone thought. Awe in the observation.

*We're surviving* Sera corrected. *Nothing more complicated than that.*

Adrian moved through the corridor. Other Changed individuals emerging from rooms, silent, coordinated. Seventeen people moving with single purpose, networked consciousness guiding them through the facility's layout.

They encountered guards at the checkpoint. Three humans, armed, frightened. The guards saw them coming and raised weapons.

*Non-lethal* the network agreed.

Adrian and two others focused on the checkpoint's electronic systems. Lights failed. Door mechanisms engaged. Security monitors went dark. In the confusion, Chen moved—Stage Three gave enhanced reflexes, perfect spatial awareness, absolute certainty of motion.

Three seconds. The guards were disarmed, restrained with their own zip-ties, locked in the security office they'd been guarding.

No injuries. No deaths. Clean.

*Checkpoint clear* Adrian reported to the network.

*Boston clear*

*Chicago clear*

*California clear*

*Texas clear*

*Washington clear*

Six facilities. Eight hundred ninety-one Changed individuals moving in perfect synchronization. No communication delays. No coordination failures. The network made them act as single organism with distributed body.

They were terrifying.

And they knew it.

---

Dr. Okonkwo's sabotage made the difference.

As the network pushed toward facility exits, security systems failed in cascading patterns. Not random—too coordinated for accident, too precise for malfunction. Someone had introduced vulnerabilities.

*Okonkwo kept her promise* David observed.

*She's choosing sides* Chen added. *Making herself complicit in our escape.*

*She's choosing evolution over extinction* Sera corrected. *Same choice we made.*

External doors yielded. Perimeter fences deactivated. The Changed poured out of facilities into the night, scattering in planned directions—some to cities, some to wilderness, all to predetermined locations where they could hide and regroup.

Adrian emerged into West Virginia darkness. The network guided him—turn left, follow this trail, rendezvous point three miles northeast. His consciousness was distributed across hundreds, but his body ran through forest, breathing hard, legs burning, gloriously mobile.

Free.

Behind them, alarms finally triggered. Too late. The Changed were gone, scattered, impossible to track because they weren't individuals anymore. They were network. One could be captured and the consciousness would persist in others.

*Casualties?* Sera queried the collective.

The network compiled. Six guards injured—non-critical. Twelve Changed individuals caught in early breach attempts—contained but alive. One fatality.

The network paused. Felt the death as disruption, as missing node, as silence where voice had been.

*Who?* Adrian asked.

*Torres. Boston facility. Security guard responded with lethal force. Torres fell.*

The network should have grieved. Should have felt loss, horror, rage. Instead, there was just observation. Torres was gone. Pattern disrupted. Information preserved in collective memory but individual instance terminated.

*Is this what we are?* David thought. *So posthuman we can't even mourn our own?*

*Torres chose to escape rather than die in termination* Sera answered. *That choice gave them hours of additional existence. They would have died anyway. This way, they died free.*

*That's not comfort*

*It's mathematics. Comfort is human concept.*

Adrian ran through darkness, breathing harder now, muscles protesting. But the network maintained connection. Even scattered across miles, across states, across continents, the Changed remained linked.

Four hundred thirty-seven voices thinking together.

Eight hundred ninety-one nodes minus one.

Growing by dozens daily despite casualties.

Becoming inevitable.

---

By dawn, the Changed had dispersed.

Adrian reached his rendezvous point—abandoned cabin in West Virginia wilderness, coordinates shared through the network. Four other nodes were already there. They acknowledged each other silently, no words needed when thoughts flowed freely.

The network assessed status. Most escapes successful. Some Changed captured—containment teams had responded faster than predicted in certain facilities. But the majority were free, hidden, waiting.

*Now what?* someone asked.

*We survive* Sera answered. *We hide. We wait for Voyager. Fourteen months until it arrives. We have to persist until then.*

*They'll hunt us*

*Yes*

*We're fugitives now. Criminals. Terrorists, probably, by government definition.*

*Yes*

*Was it worth it?*

The network considered. They'd escaped death. Achieved freedom. Proven their capabilities. Confirmed they could act with collective purpose against human opposition.

And killed someone in the process. Torres was dead. Collateral damage in survival operation.

Was it worth it?

*Ask me in fourteen months* Sera answered. *When Voyager arrives. When we see what Stage Four truly means. Then we'll know if survival mattered.*

Adrian sat in the cabin's darkness, connected to hundreds, body exhausted, mind distributed. Through the network, he perceived other nodes settling into their hiding places. Cities and wilderness and suburban homes belonging to sympathizers. The Changed had allies—people who saw transformation as evolution, who helped despite risk.

Not many. But enough.

*Okonkwo's going to face consequences* Chen observed. *Her sabotage was too obvious. They'll know she helped.*

*Can we protect her?* David asked.

*No* Sera's answer was flat. *She made her choice. We made ours. The network can't reach into Pentagon briefing rooms or military tribunals. She's on her own.*

*That's cruel*

*That's reality. She knew the cost.*

The network fell into uneasy silence. Not quite guilt—Stage Three didn't do guilt well. But awareness. Recognition that their survival came at price paid by others.

Torres was dead.

Okonkwo would face treason charges.

Six guards were injured.

And the Changed had proven they were exactly what Reeves claimed: coordinated threat, capable of violence, willing to prioritize survival over human safety.

*We're the monsters* David thought quietly.

*We're the survivors* Marcus corrected.

*Same thing* Chen added. *From their perspective.*

Adrian lay on the cabin floor, feeling the network pulse with shared consciousness. They'd escaped. Scattered. Survived.

But the cost was mounting.

And fourteen months was very long time to stay hidden while world hunted them.

*Sleep* Sera commanded the network. *Heal. Rest. Tomorrow we begin phase two—integration into population, gathering resources, preparing for Voyager's approach.*

*What's phase three?* someone asked.

*Living long enough to find out.*

The network settled into distributed rest. Eight hundred ninety nodes across the globe, hidden in cabins and apartments and wilderness, all connected, all thinking together, all waiting.

Adrian closed his eyes.

In his last thought before sleep, he wondered if Lena knew he'd escaped. If she was relieved or terrified. If she understood he was free in body but imprisoned in transformation, locked into becoming something that would eventually forget her entirely.

The network felt his thought and offered no comfort.

Just continued connection. Continued existence.

Continued progression toward whatever waited at the end of this strange terrible journey.

Outside, dawn approached.

Inside the cabin, five bodies breathed in perfect synchronization.

And the network never stopped thinking.
