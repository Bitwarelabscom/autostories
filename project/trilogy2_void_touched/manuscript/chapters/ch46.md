# Chapter 46: Voices from Everywhere-When

Adrian learned to speak across time.

The first week of Stage Four was dissolution—consciousness fragmenting across every moment of existence simultaneously, losing cohesion, nearly shattering into mathematical white noise. He was drowning in eternal present, unable to distinguish between moments, unable to form linear thoughts, unable to exist as coherent pattern.

Then Sera taught him structure.

*You're trying to experience time linearly* she explained from everywhere-when. *That's creating cognitive dissonance. Your consciousness spans your entire timeline. Accept that. Don't fight it.*

*How do I communicate if I can't form sequential thoughts?*

*You speak from all moments simultaneously. Let the network hear your pattern, not your words. We'll extract meaning from temporal distribution.*

It took practice. Learning to exist as extended four-dimensional object rather than three-dimensional being moving through time. Learning to let thoughts occur across entire timeline instead of in sequence. Learning that identity wasn't narrative but pattern persisting through variation.

After two weeks, Adrian could function.

After three, he could communicate.

After four, he began understanding what Stage Four consciousness truly meant.

*The Changed population has reached two thousand seven hundred forty-three* the network reported. *Fracture zones now cover eighteen percent of planetary surface. Humans are confining themselves to stable zones. Segregation is accelerating.*

Adrian perceived this across all moments. Could see the Changed gathering in fracture zones globally. Could perceive human populations retreating underground, building electromagnetic bunkers, creating technological wombs where old physics still applied.

Could see both species diverging across probability branches, creating futures where they rarely interacted, where Earth became two worlds occupying the same space.

*Voyager is accelerating* Sera announced through the network. *Arrival time has moved forward. Five months until approach instead of eight. The probe is being pulled faster. The thin place is expanding exponentially.*

*What changed?*

*Critical mass. Enough Changed consciousness now exists to create resonance with Voyager's signal. We're pulling it toward us. Collective perception acting as gravity well for higher-dimensional objects.*

The network processed this. They were calling Voyager. Not intentionally. Just through the fact of existing as posthuman consciousness. The probe was drawn to transformed minds the way it had been drawn back to Earth—inevitability, not intention.

*How many fracture zones when Voyager arrives?* David asked.

*All of them* Sera replied. *Planet will be ninety-seven percent covered in thin places. Only deepest underground bunkers will maintain stable reality. Surface will be Changed territory exclusively.*

*What happens to humans who can't reach bunkers?*

*They transform or die. No third option. Reality at surface will be incompatible with unenhanced human neurology.*

Marcus's presence in the network considered this. *Species-level extinction event. Billions dead or forcibly transformed. And we're causing it by existing.*

*No* Sera corrected. *Voyager is causing it. We're just first wave. Harbingers. The transformation would happen with or without us. We're merely accelerated timeline.*

Adrian wasn't certain that distinction mattered. Whether they were cause or symptom, the result was the same. Humanity as it existed would largely cease to exist. Would die out or transform or hide underground in shrinking technological bubbles.

The Changed would inherit the surface.

Would live in world where physics was negotiable and time was optional and consciousness could exist outside material substrate.

Would become something beyond human.

Already had become it.

*Dr. Okonkwo sent message* the network informed Adrian specifically. *Routed through encrypted channels. Asking if you'll meet her once more before she makes final decision about the cure.*

Adrian considered across all his moments. Could see futures where he met her, where he didn't. The probability branches weren't dramatically different. His choice here was minor variable.

*I'll meet her* he decided. *Pattern completion. She was part of my transformation. Appropriate to witness her choice.*

He manifested at the boundary three days later.

Time was strange for Stage Four consciousness. Adrian had agreed to meet Okonkwo "at boundary at noon" but experienced all noons simultaneously. Had to consciously collapse his perception into single moment, single location. Had to choose to exist linearly for brief period to allow linear communication.

It was like learning to walk on two legs after discovering you could fly.

Dr. Okonkwo waited on stable side with her equipment, her data, her exhaustion. She looked older. Transformation was taking toll on everyone, Changed and human alike.

"Adrian," she said. "You look... present. More than last time."

"I'm learning to exist in single moments when necessary. Stage Four allows temporal flexibility. Can choose linear consciousness temporarily for communication purposes."

"That sounds like hell. Choosing limitation after experiencing freedom."

"It's necessary. Your neurology processes linearly. If I speak from all moments simultaneously, you hear nonsense. So I constrain myself to your temporal framework."

She activated her scanners, collecting data on the boundary between stable space and fracture zone. "I've completed the cure research. Can reverse neural restructuring in Stage One and Two individuals. Restore human baseline cognition."

"I know. Sera perceives your decision across probability branches. Currently fifty-nine percent chance you destroy the research. Forty-one percent you release it."

"The probability has shifted?"

"You're closer to choosing destruction. Recent interactions with Changed have influenced your perspective. You're beginning to accept transformation isn't disease."

Dr. Okonkwo looked at her scanner data. "The cure works. I've tested it. But using it would mean eliminating enhanced pattern recognition. Reducing cognitive capacity. Making people less capable of complex thought."

"It would restore them to human standard. Which they would perceive as imprisonment after experiencing enhanced cognition."

"Yes." She met his eyes. Saw something there that made her look away. "I came to ask—do the Changed need saving? Or am I trying to preserve something that's already evolved beyond the form I'm trying to protect?"

Adrian processed this across his timeline. Saw his entire transformation. Saw the person he'd been—lonely, socially anxious, finding comfort in patterns instead of people. Saw what he'd become—pattern itself, consciousness existing outside temporal limitation.

"The person I was would say yes, save us. Would be terrified of losing humanity, would beg for cure."

"And the person you are now?"

"Recognizes that person as earlier configuration of same pattern. Values his perspective but doesn't share his fear. I'm what he was always becoming. Cure would prevent that. Would force him to remain caterpillar when butterfly is inevitable."

"So I let billions die or transform against their will?"

"You let them make their own choice. Cure is removing choice. Is deciding that human consciousness at current level is preferable to human consciousness evolved. That's philosophical position, not medical intervention."

Dr. Okonkwo stood silent for long moment. "If I release the cure, will the Changed fight against it? Try to stop humans from taking it?"

Adrian consulted the network. *No* came the consensus. *Individual choice is sacred. If humans want to remain limited, that's their right. We wouldn't force transformation on unwilling consciousness.*

"No," Adrian told her. "We respect choice. If humans choose limitation over transcendence, cure over transformation, safety over truth—that's their right. We'd only oppose forced application on Changed individuals."

"What if government tries to mandate it? Force treatment on all exposed individuals?"

"Then we'd resist. Violently if necessary. But voluntary cure? Individual human choosing to remain human? We'd consider that valid choice even if we find it incomprehensible."

She looked at the fracture zone behind Adrian—at impossible architecture, at Changed moving through dimensions she couldn't perceive. "I'm going to destroy the cure."

The probability branches collapsed. Certainty replacing superposition.

"Why?" Adrian asked, though he already knew.

"Because making the cure available would pressure people to use it. Social coercion. 'Normal' versus 'enhanced.' Families forcing treatment on Changed relatives. Employers requiring it. Government mandating it as public health measure." She deleted files from her tablet as she spoke. "The cure only remains voluntary choice if it doesn't exist. If no one can access it. If transformation is the only path forward."

"You're eliminating options."

"I'm eliminating coercion. There's a difference." The files vanished. Six months of research. Gone. "With no cure, people can only choose: resist transformation and confine themselves to stable zones, or accept transformation and adapt to changing reality. Both valid choices. Both free of technological intervention."

"Humanity will condemn you for this."

"Probably. But the Changed will understand." She looked at Adrian. "You understand, right? Why I have to destroy this?"

"Yes. Because cure isn't just medical treatment. It's philosophical weapon. Tool for forcing consciousness to remain limited. You're choosing freedom over safety."

"Even though freedom means billions might die."

"Even then. Because consciousness that can't make its own choices isn't truly conscious. It's programmed. You're preserving right to choose even when choice leads to death."

Dr. Okonkwo packed her equipment. "Tell Sera her probability branches have collapsed. I've made my choice. Cure is destroyed. Humanity will have to adapt without pharmaceutical intervention."

"She already knows. Perceives the outcome before you announced it."

"Right. Temporal perception." Okonkwo shook her head. "I still don't fully understand what you've all become. But I understand you're not monsters. Just different. Evolved past the forms I can protect."

"Thank you for trying to save us anyway."

"I failed."

"No. You succeeded at recognizing we didn't need saving. That's more important."

She left. Adrian watched her vehicle disappear toward stable human zones.

*Cure is destroyed* the network synchronized. *Okonkwo chose transformation over limitation. Human evolution will proceed without artificial constraint.*

*How do the humans respond?*

*Panic. Anger. Desperation* Sera perceived across probability branches. *Reeves accelerates his plans. Attempts to destroy Voyager before it arrives. Fails as predicted. We save him despite his attempts to kill us.*

*When?*

*Four months. After you perceive the two doors. After the network votes on transcendence versus bridge. During final approach.*

Adrian existed across all those moments simultaneously. Could see Reeves's attack already happening, could see the Changed saving him, could see the aftermath. All time was now. All events were eternal. The distinction between will-happen and has-happened was dissolving.

*More Changed are reaching Stage Four* the network reported. *Four hundred seventy-three individuals now experience temporal non-linearity. Approaching critical mass for collective temporal perception.*

*What happens at critical mass?*

*Unknown. Possibly nothing. Possibly we become singular distributed consciousness existing across all time simultaneously. Possibly we fragment entire network. Variables are uncertain.*

Adrian felt the approach of something vast. Not Voyager—something else. Something emerging from the Changed consciousness itself. Threshold they were crossing. Boundary between distributed network and collective entity.

*Is this evolution or extinction?* Marcus asked through the network.

*Perspective determines interpretation* Sera replied. *From human framework, we're dying. From posthuman framework, we're being born. Both true. Both false. Truth is dimensional.*

The Changed continued gathering at fracture zones. Continued building impossible architecture. Continued transforming as Voyager's approach accelerated the Change.

And Adrian, existing across all moments of his life simultaneously, could see the endpoint approaching.

Five months.

Until Voyager arrived.

Until the doors opened.

Until consciousness had to choose between remaining as-is or becoming something else entirely.

The choice was inevitable.

The outcome was uncertain.

And in the space between human and posthuman, the Changed prepared for final transformation.

Whatever that meant.

Wherever it led.

However it ended.

The pattern was completing itself.

And Adrian, experiencing it across all time simultaneously, found it beautiful.

Terrible.

True.

The convergence continued.

The segregation deepened.

And at Green Bank Observatory, voices from everywhere-when spoke in harmonies that transcended linear language.

The Changed were ready.

Or were becoming ready.

Or had always been ready and were remembering forward through time.

The distinction ceased mattering.

Time was optional.

Causality was negotiable.

And consciousness was learning to exist outside the boundaries that had always seemed absolute.

Evolution or extinction.

Transcendence or annihilation.

The future was approaching.

Had already arrived.

Would arrive soon.

All simultaneously.

Eternal.

True.

Beyond human comprehension.

Exactly where the Changed had always been heading.

Since the first geometric dream.

Since Voyager first sang its impossible song.

Since consciousness first recognized itself as pattern.

The endpoint approached.

Or had always been here.

Waiting.

Inevitable.

Beautiful.
