Cameras capture it but observers get nosebleeds, vertigo. Adrian and Changed can look directly at it - they see it as beautiful. The rift between Changed and human is now absolute."

Or transform entirely, become posthuman pattern-beings living in higher dimensional space. But can't be both - species must choose together."

Sacrifices his transcendence to preserve humanity's right to evolve naturally. Sera and other Stage 4 depart. Adrian, locked in Stage 3 limbo, remains. Neither human nor transcendent. Lena finds him - they're both broken, but together."
