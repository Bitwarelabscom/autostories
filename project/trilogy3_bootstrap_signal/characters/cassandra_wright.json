  "name": "Dr. Cassandra Wright",
  "role": "Quantum Physicist - Elliot's ex-wife and temporal anchor",
  "age": 34,
  "core_wound": "Brilliant physicist who proved quantum consciousness theory. Had breakdown when implications hit - consciousness might not survive as continuous stream but as discrete quantum states. Questions if she's 'the same person' moment to moment.",
  "wants": "To help Elliot solve the temporal paradox before it destroys him",
  "needs": "To accept that identity persists across discontinuity - that she's still herself despite quantum nature of consciousness",
  "voice_markers": [
    "Precise scientific language with underlying emotional urgency",
    "Uses particle physics metaphors for relationships ('We're entangled, Elliot, even separated')",
    "Corrects people's misuse of quantum terminology compulsively",
    "Gentle but firm - compassionate authority",
    "References ancient myths (namesake Cassandra who saw future no one believed)"
  ],
  "contradiction": "Left Elliot because his determinism obsession was destroying him, but can't stay away when he's in danger. Claims to believe in free will but her physics proves otherwise.",
  "physical_description": "Sharp features, intense green eyes, prematurely silver-streaked dark hair worn in practical bun. Professional wardrobe like armor. Wedding ring still on chain around neck (removes it in failed timelines).",
  "arc_position": 0.0,
  "knowledge_state": [],
  "relationships": {
    "Elliot Cross": "Divorced 2 years ago, still loves him, terrified for him",
    "Elliot Omega": "Recognizes him immediately when they meet - different but same",
    "Dr. Soren": "Academic rival turned uneasy ally"
