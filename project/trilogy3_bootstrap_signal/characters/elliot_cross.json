  "name": "Dr. Elliot Cross",
  "role": "Protagonist - SETI Signal Analyst and reluctant time traveler",
  "age": 36,
  "core_wound": "Grew up as child of deterministic atheist father who taught that free will is illusion. Spent life trying to prove choices matter. Discovering he's living a predestined loop destroys his philosophical foundation.",
  "wants": "To understand the signal and break free from the temporal loop",
  "needs": "To accept that choice can matter even within determinism - that how you walk the path is freedom",
  "voice_markers": [
    "Noir internal monologue - cynical, observational ('The rain didn't care about my problems')",
    "Questions phrased as statements ('I wasn't sure if I was remembering or predicting')",
    "Temporal confusion in tense - shifts between past/present/future mid-sentence",
    "Philosophical asides about free will and causality",
    "Dark humor about determinism ('I chose to have no choice')"
  ],
  "contradiction": "Fights against predetermined fate while using future knowledge to navigate present. Claims to want freedom while following the script. Seeks to break the loop while knowing loop must complete.",
  "physical_description": "Perpetually exhausted, dark circles under gray eyes. Unkempt dark hair showing early gray. Wears same clothes for days - doesn't see point in maintaining appearance. Notebook full of annotations in different handwriting (his own, across loops). Chain smoker despite knowing it doesn't matter.",

    "loop_awareness_ch1": "None - living linearly",
