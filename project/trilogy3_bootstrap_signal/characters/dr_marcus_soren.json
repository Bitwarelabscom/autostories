  "role": "Leader of The Recursionists - time cult that decoded signal first",
  "age": 51,
  "core_wound": "Was renowned physicist until he discovered proof of bootstrap paradox 10 years ago. Published findings, was academically destroyed. Went underground, built cult around the signal. Now vindicated but broken.",
  "wants": "To be the one who closes the loop - to have his role in salvation recognized",

  "voice_markers": [
    "Prophetic cadence - speaks like preaching gospel",
    "Refers to Elliot as 'The Chosen Variable' or 'Closer of the Loop'",
    "Uses temporal terminology religiously ('We are blessed to live in the final iteration')",
    "Calm certainty that unnerves - never doubts",
    "Quotes himself from his discredited papers"
  ],
  "contradiction": "Builds cult around temporal determinism while believing individual (Elliot) has agency to close loop. Worships causality while trying to manipulate it.",
  "physical_description": "Academic disheveled - tweed jacket, wild gray hair, intense stare. Surrounded by followers who mirror his mannerisms. Temporal equations tattooed on forearms. Carries original Voyager blueprints everywhere.",

    "Elliot Cross": "Obsessed with him as prophesied figure - protective and controlling",
