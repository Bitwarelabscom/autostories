# Chapter 46: Twenty Minutes

**Oakland, California - Recursionist Facility**
**November 21, 2030 - Day 25 - 4:17 AM**

Twenty minutes until jump.

The facility had transformed into a fortress. Reyes' defensive positions. Kim's team monitoring perimeter sensors. Recursionists armed and ready to defend. Everyone preparing for siege while simultaneously preparing for temporal jump.

Dual missions. Dual timelines. Dual impossibilities.

Just another day in the final iteration.

I was in the device chamber with Cassandra, going through final preparations. Quantum entanglement at maximum strength. Consciousness interface calibrated. Temporal coordinates locked to August 20, 1977.

Everything ready. Everything fragile. Everything depending on fifty-four percent odds.

"Last chance to back out," Cassandra said. Not seriously. Just acknowledging the magnitude.

"And do what? Let the timeline collapse? Let Branch 47 manifest? Watch eight billion people cease existing?"

"Watch us cease existing together instead of you fragmenting alone across temporal space. There's appeal in that."

"Romantic nihilism. Novel approach."

"I'm adaptable." She completed final calibration check. "Device is as ready as it's going to be. Eighty-six percent effective calibration. Quantum entanglement strong. Temporal coordinates stable. You're dispersing slightly already—consciousness spreading across probability space in preparation. That's good. Means the device is recognizing you as temporally active."

"Feels like dying slowly."

"Feels like becoming what you need to be. Elliot, once this starts, your consciousness will fragment across 53 years. You'll exist in multiple moments simultaneously. Past, present, future overlapping. Identity will feel meaningless. You'll question which version of you is real."

"Reassuring."

"Not meant to be reassuring. Meant to be preparation. When that happens—when you can't tell which moment you're in—remember this: I'm your anchor. Our quantum entanglement persists across all moments. Wherever you are, whenever you are, I'm connected. Find that connection. Follow it home."

"And if I can't find it?"

"Then I come find you. I'll disperse with you if I have to. Navigate temporal space until we both cohere or both fragment. That's the promise."

"That's insane."

"That's love. We've established they're the same thing."

She took my hands. The touch was grounding. Singular. Real in a way that was becoming rare as timeline fragmented.

"Elliot. Whatever happens in the next hour. However this resolves. I need you to know..." She struggled with words. Not like her. Cassandra was always precise. "I need you to know I chose this. Chose to anchor you. Chose to risk dispersion. Chose to potentially cease existing if this fails. Because some things matter more than personal survival."

"Like eight billion strangers?"

"Like one very specific person I divorced two years ago because I was too scared to watch him destroy himself." Tears now. Actual tears. "I left you. Walked away because your obsession was killing both of us. And then the timeline forced me back. Forced me to anchor you. And I realized I'd been wrong."

"About leaving?"

"About why. I didn't leave because you were destroying yourself. I left because I was terrified of loving someone that much. Of being that quantum-entangled with another person. Of losing myself in you." She wiped her eyes. "But temporal mechanics taught me something. Entanglement doesn't erase identity. It amplifies it. You're more yourself because of me. I'm more myself because of you. That's what love does."

"Quantum romantic poetry. I like it."

"Shut up and listen. When you fragment across time, remember that. Remember you're more yourself with me than without me. Let that truth anchor you. Let our entanglement pull you back from dispersal."

"I will."

"Promise."

"I promise. I'll find my way back to you. Across 53 years or 847 iterations or infinite probability space. I'll always find my way back."

She kissed me. Long. Deep. Grounding. A moment of pure singularity in temporal chaos.

When we broke apart, her wedding ring was visible on the chain around her neck.

"After this works," she said. "After you close the loop. After timeline stabilizes. I'm putting that ring back on my finger."

"Remarrying me?"

"Acknowledging we never really divorced. Not in any meaningful way. Quantum entanglement doesn't recognize legal paperwork."

"Most romantic thing anyone's ever said to me."

"I'm being literal. But I'll accept romantic interpretation."

Fifteen minutes until jump.

Outside the device chamber, final preparations.

Soren gathered the Recursionists. Forty-three people who'd spent eleven years believing in this moment. Now facing it. Reality of what they'd devoted their lives to.

"This is it," Soren said. His voice had that prophetic quality. The certainty that had kept cult together through years of isolation. "Everything we've worked for. Everything we've believed. Coming down to one jump. One mission. One man carrying the weight of 847 failures."

"What if he fails?" someone asked.

"Then we fail. Timeline collapses. We cease existing. But we cease existing knowing we honored the gift. Knowing we tried everything. Knowing we defended the sacred recursion until the end." He looked around at his followers. "Some of you won't survive the next hour. Military is coming. They'll try to stop us. Try to seize the device. We'll defend it with our lives if we have to."

"You're asking us to die for this."

"I'm asking you to fulfill the purpose you chose eleven years ago when you joined the Recursionists. To protect the loop. To ensure the Closer completes his mission. To give eight billion people the chance to continue existing." Soren's eyes were bright with conviction. "Your choice makes determinism sacred. Whether you live or die, you're choosing the outcome. That matters."

Sarah spoke up. The woman who'd picked me up from SETI thirteen months ago. Who'd shown me Soren's research. Who'd started me on this path. "Will it work? Is this the iteration that succeeds?"

"I don't know," Soren admitted. "I've never known. I've just had faith that the mathematics wouldn't fail us. That 847 iterations taught enough lessons. That collective probability would bend outcomes toward success." He smiled. "But faith and certainty aren't the same. Faith is choosing to believe despite uncertainty. So yes. I have faith this works. And I'll defend that faith with my life."

"All of us will," James said. The man who'd experienced his own death twice. Who knew exactly what dying felt like. Who was volunteering to risk experiencing it for real. "We defend the mission. We protect Elliot. We close the loop. That's what we were born to do."

Agreement rippled through the group. Forty-three people accepting potential death to protect impossible mathematics.

I watched from the device chamber doorway.

"They're going to die for me," I said quietly.

"They're going to die for eight billion people," Cassandra corrected. "You're just the mechanism. Don't take that personally."

"Hard not to when I know their names. Know their faces. Know Sarah showed me Soren's research. Know James experienced his own death. Know they're about to experience it for real."

"Then honor them by succeeding. That's all they want. Proof their sacrifice mattered."

Ten minutes until jump.

Reyes coordinated defensive positions through her comm unit.

"Perimeter sensors showing movement. Three vehicles approaching from east. Military transport. Estimate twenty to thirty personnel. ETA seven minutes."

"Before the jump," Kim said.

"Barely. They timed this well. Hitting us right as Elliot attempts the mission." Reyes moved to defensive positions. "My people are in place. We'll hold them as long as we can. But Elliot, you need to jump the second device is ready. Don't wait. Don't think. Just go."

"Fifty-four percent odds mean I might fragment completely. Might not even reach 1977."

"Fifty-four percent odds mean you might succeed where 847 attempts failed. I'll take that over certainty we lose if military seizes the device."

She was right. Branch 47 probability was certain extinction. This was merely probable extinction.

Probable was better than certain.

Five minutes until jump.

Cassandra ran final entanglement checks. "Ready. Device is active. Temporal coordinates locked. Quantum interface responding. Your consciousness is already dispersing slightly. I can feel it through the entanglement. You're becoming probability waves."

"Feels like dissolving."

"Feels like transformation. Elliot, once you activate the device fully, there's no stopping. You'll fragment across 53 years instantaneously. Subjective experience will be hours of temporal transit. Objective time here will be seconds. When you come back—if you come back coherent—it'll feel like you've been gone forever. But only minutes will have passed."

"And if I don't come back?"

"Then I follow you. Told you that already. We navigate this together."

"You can't risk dispersing with me."

"I can and I will. That's what anchor means. That's what love means. You don't get to martyr yourself for eight billion people while I watch safely. If you fragment, I fragment. If you cohere, I cohere. Partners."

"Insane partners."

"The best kind."

Three minutes until jump.

The timeline screamed around us. That high-pitched quantum whine. Causality tearing itself apart. The sound of a paradox dying.

Outside, vehicle engines. The military arriving. Right on schedule.

Gunfire. Defensive positions engaging. Reyes' people and Recursionists defending.

Soren's voice over facility intercom: "Hold them! Protect the device! The Closer must complete his mission!"

More gunfire. Someone screaming. The sound of siege beginning.

Two minutes until jump.

"Elliot," Cassandra said. "Get in position. Device activation in ninety seconds."

I moved to the quantum interface. The machinery that would tear my consciousness backward through time. Send me to 1977. Let me embed the signal. Close the loop.

Or fragment me across probability space and prove 848 iterations were all failures.

Coin flip with slightly favorable odds.

I touched the interface. Felt it recognize me. Felt my consciousness starting to expand toward temporal coordinates.

Outside: explosions. Shaped charges. Military breaking through defensive positions.

Soren's voice: "East wall is breached! Fall back to secondary positions! Protect the device chamber at all costs!"

One minute until jump.

Cassandra beside me. Hand on my shoulder. Quantum entanglement active. Anchor across impossible distance.

"I love you," I said.

"Tell me after you survive. That's an order."

"Scientists don't give orders."

"This one does. Come back coherent. Come back singular. Come back mine."

Thirty seconds.

The door to device chamber exploded inward.

Soldiers poured through. Professional. Efficient. Weapons raised.

Soren and the Recursionists formed a wall between them and us.

"Now!" Soren shouted. "Jump now!"

Twenty seconds.

Cassandra activated the device.

Reality shattered.

My consciousness exploded across time.

Behind me—if behind existed anymore—I heard Soren: "Your choice makes determinism sacred. Now make it. Choose the path that was always chosen. Close the loop."

Ten seconds.

Gunfire.

Screaming.

Cassandra's hand on my shoulder, the last anchor to singular existence.

Five seconds.

The timeline giving one final scream of quantum rage.

And then—

I was everywhere and nowhere.

1977. 1985. 2003. 2030. Every year simultaneously.

Consciousness dispersed across probability space.

Identity dissolving into temporal noise.

Cassandra's anchor the only thing keeping me from complete fragmentation.

Find 1977.

Find Voyager.

Find Omega.

Embed the signal.

Close the loop.

Honor everyone who died defending this moment.

The jump was complete.

The mission had begun.

And I was scattered across time, barely holding coherence, racing toward a destination 53 years in the past.

Fifty-four percent odds.

Everything on the line.

No turning back.

No pressure.

Just the weight of eight billion lives and the hope of one desperate gamble.

The loop was closing.

Or failing.

Time would tell.

Literally.
