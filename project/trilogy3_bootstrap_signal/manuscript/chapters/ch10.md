# Chapter 10: First Temporal Bleed

**Berkeley, California - Cassandra's University Lab**
**November 8, 2029 - 4:17 PM**

The memory hit me like a bullet.

I was in an alley. Rain hammering down, turning the pavement into a mirror that reflected neon signs in fractured colors. Someone was running behind me, footsteps echoing off brick walls. My lungs burned. My hands were empty—I'd dropped something, couldn't remember what.

Then the shot.

Pain blooming in my chest, hot and expanding. The taste of copper flooding my mouth. Falling forward, watching the wet pavement rush up to meet my face. Thinking, with perfect clarity: *This is how I die. This is how it ends.*

And then I was back.

Cassandra's lab. The smell of coffee and ozone. Late afternoon light slanting through windows. My heart hammering against ribs that had no bullet hole, breath coming in ragged gasps.

I looked down at my chest. No blood. No wound. Just my own hands shaking as they pressed against fabric that wasn't torn.

"Elliot?"

Cassandra's voice came from somewhere far away. I blinked, and she snapped into focus. She was standing three feet away, one hand reaching toward me, her face tight with concern.

"What just happened?" she asked.

"I..." My voice came out rough, like I'd been screaming. "I was shot. In an alley. I felt it. I died."

She went very still. "When?"

"Just now. No—not now. I don't know. It hasn't happened. But I remember it. I remember dying."

The words sounded insane even as I said them. But the memory was there, vivid and complete. More real than most of my actual memories. I could still feel the rain on my face, still taste blood in my mouth.

Cassandra moved to her laptop, fingers already flying across the keyboard. "Describe everything. Location, time of day, weather. Every detail you can remember."

I closed my eyes, chasing the fragments before they dissolved. "Urban. Old buildings, brick. Neon signs—Chinese characters, I think. Night time. Heavy rain. Someone was chasing me. I was running from... something. Government? I'd taken something, or hidden something. Then the shot."

"Did you see who shot you?"

"No. They were behind me. Professional. Single shot, center mass." I opened my eyes. "Cass, I've never been shot. I've never even been in a fight. So why do I have a perfect memory of being murdered in an alley?"

She didn't answer immediately. Just kept typing, pulling up data on her screen. Quantum probability models, the ones she'd been developing to map the temporal mechanics of the bootstrap signal. After a moment, she turned the laptop toward me.

"Look at this."

The screen showed a complex diagram of branching probability clouds. Timeline echoes, she called them. Alternate versions of events radiating from decision points like cracks in glass.

"The signal isn't just sending information," she said quietly. "It's creating quantum entanglement between your consciousness and the causal loop. Every iteration of the timeline that collapsed before this one—every failed loop where different choices were made—exists as a probability echo. Normally, those echoes don't interact with our timeline. They're separate worlds that never quite cohered into reality."

"But?"

"But you're temporally entangled with the Voyager signal. Your consciousness is acting as an observer across multiple probability states. The closer you get to the signal, the more you study it, the more entangled you become." She highlighted a particular branch on her diagram. "You're not hallucinating, Elliot. You're experiencing memories from timeline iterations that failed. Timelines where you made different choices and died different ways."

The lab felt colder suddenly. "How many failed timelines are there?"

"We don't know. The Recursionists' models suggest hundreds. Maybe thousands. Every time the loop tried to close and failed, it created another iteration. Another attempt to get the causality right." She looked at me, and I saw fear in her eyes. "You're remembering lives you lived that never quite happened."

I sat down heavily in her desk chair. My chest still ached from a wound that didn't exist.

"Can you stop it?" I asked.

"I don't know. Maybe. But Elliot..." She paused, choosing her words carefully. "These memories might be important. They're showing you failure modes. Ways the timeline can collapse. If you can learn to interpret them, they might help you avoid the same mistakes."

"Or drive me insane trying to figure out which memories are real and which are echoes from timelines that don't exist."

"Both can be true."

I laughed, but there was no humor in it. "My father would have loved this. Proof that every choice creates a branching reality, and I get to experience all of them. Free will as infinite torture."

Cassandra moved closer, her hand finding my shoulder. The touch was grounding, real. "Your father was wrong about free will. These timelines failed precisely because free will matters. Each one collapsed because someone—you, Soren, Reyes, someone—made a choice that broke the causal chain. The fact that there are failed loops proves that choice has consequences."

"Consoling," I said. "I get to remember all the ways my choices killed me."

"Better than not knowing they're coming."

I looked up at her. "That's supposed to help?"

"No. But it's true." She sat down across from me, her scientist's mind already processing possibilities. "Can you remember anything else? Details about the alley, when it might happen, what led to you being there?"

I closed my eyes again, diving back into the memory. It was already fading at the edges, the way dreams fade in morning light. But the central image remained: rain, neon, the burning in my chest.

"Chinese characters on the signs. Chinatown, maybe? San Francisco? I was carrying something. Data, I think. A drive. I'd stolen research from somewhere. Or I was delivering it. Someone wanted it badly enough to kill me for it."

"Government?"

"Maybe. Or corporate. The Recursionists mentioned tech companies are interested in the signal." I opened my eyes. "In that timeline, I made different choices. Worked with different people. And it got me killed."

Cassandra typed notes, building a profile of the failed timeline. "If this happens again—when this happens again—I need you to document everything immediately. We can map the decision points that led to failure. Use them as navigation markers for this timeline."

"You're talking about this like it's going to keep happening."

"It is. You're fully entangled now. The closer we get to critical decision points, the more the timelines will bleed through. Your consciousness is trying to reconcile multiple probability states simultaneously. It's going to get worse before it stabilizes."

"Define 'worse.'"

She met my eyes. "You might start experiencing multiple memories of the same moment. Contradictory realities overlapping. The sensation of living in several timelines at once."

"Temporal schizophrenia."

"Quantum superposition of consciousness. It's theoretically fascinating and practically horrifying."

I stood up, needing to move. The lab suddenly felt too small, too contained. Like a box that might collapse into itself at any moment. "The Recursionists didn't mention this."

"They probably didn't know the details. Or they did, and they didn't want to scare you off." She paused. "Or it's unique to you. You're the one who found the signal in this iteration. Maybe your consciousness has a stronger entanglement than previous Closers."

"Previous Closers. Plural. You're saying I'm not the first version of me to try this?"

"You're the first in this timeline. But if the loop has iterated hundreds of times..." She let the implication hang.

Other versions of me. Other Elliots who'd stood in other labs, experienced other temporal bleeds, made other choices. All of them trying to close the same loop. Most of them failing.

"Did any of them succeed?" I asked quietly.

"We're still here," Cassandra said. "So either one of them did, and we're living in a stable loop, or none of them did, and we're in the final iteration before the whole thing collapses."

"Comforting."

"I don't have comfort. I have data." But her voice was gentle. "For what it's worth, I think you're doing better than most of your alternate selves."

"I got shot and bled out in an alley."

"In a failed timeline. In this one, you're alive, you're learning, and you're starting to understand the mechanics of what you're dealing with." She stood, moving to stand beside me. "That has to count for something."

We stood in silence for a moment, watching equations scroll across her monitor. Probability waves collapsing and reforming, alternate realities flickering in and out of mathematical existence.

"Cass," I said finally, "what if I can't tell the difference anymore? Between this timeline and the echoes?"

"Then I'll tell you. That's why you need someone anchored in linear time. Someone who can keep you tethered to the present." She smiled slightly. "I divorced you because your obsessions were consuming you. Looks like I can't escape them after all."

"You could walk away. This isn't your problem."

"It became my problem the moment you called me at three AM with impossible data. And besides..." She turned to face me fully. "I spent years developing quantum consciousness theory. Proof that awareness exists as discrete probability states that can potentially exist across temporal coordinates. Everyone said I was chasing ghosts. You're proof I was right."

"So I'm your vindication?"

"You're my ex-husband having a mental breakdown caused by temporal mechanics I predicted. It's complicated."

Despite everything, I almost laughed. "That's one word for it."

My chest twitched. Not pain, exactly. More like phantom sensation, my body remembering an injury that hadn't happened. I pressed my hand against it, feeling the steady beat of my heart. Still alive. Still linear.

For now.

"The Recursionists said there are twelve critical decision points," I said. "Moments where my choices determine whether the timeline stabilizes or collapses."

"Then we need to identify them before you reach them. Map the probability branches. Use your temporal bleeds as data points." Cassandra pulled up a new document, started building a timeline. "When's the next critical point supposed to be?"

"Two weeks from when they told me. So..." I calculated. "November 15th. Agent Reyes is supposed to attempt an arrest. If I go with her, timeline fails. If I escape with the Recursionists' help, timeline continues."

"That's in seven days."

"I know."

"Are you going to let them help you?"

I thought about Soren's calm certainty, the warehouse full of believers mapping causality like prophets reading entrails. About Sarah's sad smile and her buried thesis. About forty people who'd chosen to follow mathematics into madness.

"I don't trust them," I said. "But I trust the math. And the math says they're right."

Cassandra nodded slowly. "Then we have seven days to prepare for the first critical decision. And to figure out how to keep you sane while your consciousness fragments across probability states."

"Simple."

"Nothing about this is simple. But we'll figure it out. We always do."

She said it with such certainty that I almost believed her. Almost believed that we could navigate a bootstrap paradox, escape federal agents, build a time machine, and close a causal loop without destroying reality in the process.

Almost.

But then my chest twinged again, and I remembered the taste of blood, and I knew that somewhere in the quantum foam of probability, other versions of me were dying in other alleys, making other mistakes, failing in other ways.

And this version—this Elliot, in this timeline, in this lab—had to learn from all those deaths without being crushed by the weight of them.

I looked at Cassandra, at her green eyes bright with scientific excitement and human concern. In how many timelines had she died? In how many had I lost her to my obsessions, or to Reyes' bullets, or to the simple causality of a universe that didn't care about happy endings?

"Thank you," I said. "For not walking away."

"Thank me when we're done. If we survive this, I'm charging you for all the therapy I'm going to need."

"Deal."

We turned back to the screens, to the mathematics of multiple realities overlapping like translucent sheets of possibility. Somewhere in that overlap was the path forward. The choices that would lead to survival instead of another failed iteration, another bleeding memory of death in an alley.

I just had to live long enough to find it.

And remember which timeline I was actually living in when the moment came to choose.

The temporal bleed had passed, but its echo remained. A shadow in my mind. The first of many.

I was becoming unstuck in time, one memory at a time.

And the worst part was knowing that every echo was a version of me who'd been certain they were making the right choice.

Right up until they weren't.
