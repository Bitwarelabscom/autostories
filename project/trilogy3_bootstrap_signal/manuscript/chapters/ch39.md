# Chapter 39: Preparing for Omega

**Berkeley, California - Safe House**
**November 2, 2030 - 10:52 PM**

Tomorrow I would meet myself.

Not metaphorical. Not through probability branches or timeline echoes. Tomorrow, Elliot Omega—the version of me who'd lived the loop hundreds of times—would manifest in this timeline.

The quantum mathematics were clear. November 3rd. The probability field showed it as certainty rather than possibility.

I was terrified.

"You're fragmenting again," Cassandra observed. We were in the workshop—really just the Berkeley safe house's basement converted to device operation space. "That's the fourth time today."

"I'm meeting the version of myself who's experienced 847 loop failures. Who exists across all iterations simultaneously. Who's become barely human from carrying that weight. Sorry if I'm fragmenting."

"You've survived worse. You experienced 73 extinctions directly. You converted Reyes under impossible odds. You can handle meeting your future self."

"Can I? What if seeing what I'm becoming breaks me? What if Omega is so far beyond human that I can't process what I'm looking at?"

"Then I anchor you through the processing. That's literally my job."

I pulled up the probability models. Tried to see tomorrow's encounter clearly. But the timelines were foggy. Omega's presence created quantum interference. Made probability observation difficult.

"I can't see it clearly," I said. "Can't map the branches. Omega's temporal signature disrupts normal observation."

"Because he exists in quantum superposition across hundreds of iterations. His probability wave interferes with yours. That's expected."

"Expected doesn't make it less terrifying."

Chen entered the basement carrying equipment. "Final device calibrations are complete. Consciousness transmission protocols are optimized. When Omega arrives tomorrow, we can discuss technical specifications for the 1977 jump."

"When. Not if."

"The probability mathematics are conclusive. He'll be here tomorrow afternoon. Has to be. This is the decision point where you learn mission requirements directly from final iteration."

I thought about it. Omega had appeared in other loop iterations—had guided previous versions of me toward closure attempts. Most had failed. A few had come close. None had succeeded.

This was my turn. The 848th attempt. Potentially the last stable iteration before the paradox collapsed entirely.

And tomorrow I'd meet the ghost of my future. The version who'd failed 847 times and was hoping I'd finally succeed.

"How do I talk to him?" I asked. "What do I even say to version of myself who's lived centuries of failure?"

"You listen," Cassandra said. "He's coming to provide guidance. To share what he's learned across iterations. You don't need to say anything profound. Just receive the information."

"He's also coming to see if this iteration looks different. If we've made better choices. If there's hope we'll succeed where he failed."

"And we have. We've navigated better than most iterations. Kept me alive longer. Converted Reyes successfully. Avoided Branch 47. Honored the original timeline. Made choices that suggest possible success."

"Possible. Not guaranteed."

"Nothing's guaranteed. But we're doing better than 738 of the previous 847 iterations. That's measurable progress."

I pulled up comparison data Chen had compiled. Our iteration's critical decisions mapped against other loop attempts. The analysis showed we'd navigated major branches more successfully than most.

But 109 iterations had reached this point—ten weeks before temporal jump—and still failed. Device malfunction. Timeline degradation. Coherence collapse. External interference.

So many ways to fail even after navigating correctly for months.

"What if meeting Omega fragments me permanently?" I asked. "What if seeing my future makes the future inevitable? Self-fulfilling prophecy?"

Cassandra crossed to me. Anchoring touch. "Meeting Omega doesn't make you become Omega. It shows you what happens if you fail to close the loop. That's motivation, not destiny."

"Omega exists because the loop keeps failing. If I succeed, the loop closes and Omega should cease to exist. But if Omega's here tomorrow, doesn't that prove the loop isn't closed yet? That we're still in failing iteration?"

"No. It proves the loop is still open. Still attempting to close. Omega exists in the space between iterations—the quantum foam where failed and successful timelines overlap. He can appear in any iteration until loop closes."

"And after?"

"After successful closure, he collapses back into your singular timeline. Becomes just you again. No longer distributed across iterations. Finally able to rest."

The thought of Omega collapsing into me—of absorbing his 847 failed attempts into my consciousness—was overwhelming.

"I'm not ready for that," I said.

"You don't have to be ready tomorrow. Tomorrow you just meet him. Learn from him. Receive guidance. The collapse comes later, if we succeed."

"If."

"When. We're choosing optimism over probability."

I thought about the 300 original timeline dead. About Dr. Park and Dr. Chen choosing to erase themselves because they believed the bootstrap timeline was worth creating. About all the sacrifices that had led to this moment.

We had to succeed. Too many people had given too much for this iteration to be the 848th failure.

"Okay," I said. "Tomorrow I meet Omega. I listen. I learn. I don't fragment permanently."

"And I observe you through it. Maintain your coherence. Make sure meeting your future doesn't erase your present."

Chen started final equipment checks. "Quantum entanglement field will spike when he arrives. The device will automatically stabilize the probability channel. You'll have approximately three hours before timeline pressure forces him to return to his distributed state."

"Three hours to learn 847 loops worth of failures."

"Three hours to understand what worked, what didn't, and what this iteration needs to do differently."

I looked at the device. Tomorrow it would channel Omega's quantum signature into manifestation. Would make my future self visible and audible. Would force me to confront what I was becoming.

Or what I could avoid becoming if we succeeded.

"Tell me I can handle this," I said to Cassandra.

"You can handle this. You've handled quantum consciousness fragmentation. You've handled 73 experienced extinctions. You've handled converting our primary hunter into ally. You can handle meeting the version of yourself who's survived 847 failures."

"He hasn't survived. He's existing. There's a difference."

"Then you show him what surviving looks like. Show him that this iteration is different. That we've made better choices. That hope is variable you're adding to the mathematics."

Hope. Omega had told past iterations to add hope. Had insisted that was the missing element. The variable that would make difference between 847 failures and one success.

We'd been trying. Had honored the original timeline. Had built observer-observed relationship. Had navigated with intention rather than desperation.

Had added hope to probability mathematics.

Tomorrow I'd find out if it was enough.

Tomorrow Omega would arrive.

Tomorrow I'd meet the ghost of my potential future and learn how to avoid becoming him.

Three hours of guidance.

Three hours of witnessing what failure looked like.

Three hours of understanding the weight I was trying to prevent carrying forever.

Cassandra held me while I processed. Anchored me while I fragmented slightly from anticipation anxiety.

"We've come so far," I said. "Ten weeks until temporal jump. We're actually going to attempt this. Going to try closing the loop."

"We're going to succeed at closing the loop," she corrected. "Omega's arrival tomorrow is confirmation we're on right path. Failed iterations don't get this far."

"109 of them did."

"And we're going to be different from those 109. We're going to be the one that succeeds."

I wanted to believe her. Wanted confidence instead of terror. Wanted to face tomorrow's encounter with Omega as opportunity rather than threat.

But I was scared.

Scared of seeing my future.

Scared of becoming what he'd become.

Scared of failing like he'd failed 847 times.

Scared that tomorrow would show me the weight was impossible to carry.

"Stay with me," I said. "Tomorrow. When he arrives. Don't leave me alone with him."

"I'll be there. Observing both of you. Maintaining both your coherences. Making sure the encounter doesn't fragment either version beyond recovery."

"Thank you."

"That's what wives do. Anchor their husbands through meetings with their temporally-distributed future selves."

"Not traditional marriage vow."

"Nothing about us is traditional."

We stayed in the basement until midnight. Running final equipment checks. Reviewing probability models. Preparing for tomorrow's encounter.

Omega was coming.

My future was manifesting.

And I had to be ready to face what I might become if I failed.

Ten weeks until temporal jump.

Seventy days until I scattered my consciousness across five decades.

1,680 hours until loop closure attempt.

But tomorrow, just one encounter.

One conversation with myself.

One chance to learn from 847 failures.

One opportunity to add hope to the mathematics.

It would have to be enough.

Because tomorrow was certainty.

And I had to face it.

Ready or not.

Probably not.

But face it anyway.

That's what navigators did.

Faced impossible moments.

And tried to collapse them into survivable timelines.

One encounter at a time.
