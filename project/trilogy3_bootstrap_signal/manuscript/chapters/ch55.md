# Chapter 55: Final Words

**Oakland, California - Facility Ruins**
**November 21, 2030 - 7:38 AM - 15 Minutes Before Final Jump**

Fifteen minutes.

The device was ready. Barely functional. Held together by salvaged parts and desperate calibration. But ready.

One more jump. Final closure. Last chance to close the loop properly.

Reyes found us in the device chamber. "Perimeter is secure. No more attackers detected. You have clear window for the jump."

"Thank you. For everything. For bringing government resources. For committing treason. For defending us while we were dispersed."

"Thank me by succeeding. Make my career destruction worth it." She paused. "Elliot. When you embed the signal this time. The final version. Include Marcus. Include proof he existed. So in future iterations, I'll know I'm not insane."

"Already did that in the first embedding. His name is in the signal. Proof of displacement. Validation of your trauma."

Her eyes got bright. She nodded once. Professional mask holding. "Good. Then close the loop. Honor everyone who died for this. Make forty-three Recursionist deaths mean something."

She left. Back to perimeter defense.

Dr. Kim approached next. His team had helped us rebuild the device from ruins. Provided expertise and equipment despite everything.

"Dr. Cross. Dr. Wright. The quantum calculations predict this jump has thirty-eight percent coherence probability. That's barely better than random chance."

"It's better than zero percent."

"Marginally. But I need you to understand: you're probably not coming back from this one. Probably dispersing permanently. Probably becoming like Omega—scattered across time, never singular again."

"We know the odds."

"And you're jumping anyway?"

"We chose to close the loop. That choice means accepting whatever probability demands. If we disperse permanently but the signal gets embedded properly, that's success. The loop closes. Timeline stabilizes. Eight billion people continue existing."

"At the cost of your coherent existence."

"At the cost of our singular existence. But we'd still exist. Just dispersed. Conscious across all moments. Together in quantum foam." I looked at Cassandra. "Some fates are worse than existing everywhere at once with the person you love."

Kim shook his head. "You're both insane. But I respect the mathematics. Good luck. And if you disperse permanently, thank you for choosing existence over collapse. That choice matters."

He returned to his team.

Ten minutes.

Survivors gathered. Twenty-three remaining government personnel. Eight surviving Recursionists. Reyes. Everyone who'd defended the mission. Everyone who'd lost colleagues and friends.

They formed a circle around the device chamber. Witness to final jump.

One of the Recursionists—a woman named Elena who'd studied under Soren—spoke: "Dr. Soren believed you were chosen. The Closer. The person destined to complete the loop. We lost him. We lost forty others. But his belief remains. We're witnesses to that belief manifesting."

"I'm not chosen. I'm just stubborn enough to keep trying."

"Chosen. Stubborn. Same thing in quantum mechanics. You're the probability wave that refused to collapse toward failure. That's destiny through determination."

"Soren would have liked that interpretation."

"Soren died believing it. We honor his faith by witnessing yours."

Five minutes.

Cassandra and I stood at the device interface. Ready for final jump. Ready to disperse across time one more time. Ready to embed the signal properly or die trying.

"Any last words?" she asked.

"Don't have last words. Just continuation. This jump closes the loop or it doesn't. Either way, we're together. Either way, we chose this. That's enough."

"Love as quantum invariant."

"Love as the only thing that persists across dispersal."

We activated the device.

The survivors watched. Witnesses to impossible mission. Witnesses to choice made manifest. Witnesses to two people who'd been divorced, scattered, given option of release, and chosen instead to jump one more time into probable death.

"Together?" Cassandra asked.

"Always together."

The device hummed to life.

Quantum fields activating.

Consciousness preparing to disperse.

One more journey to 1977. One more embedding. One more chance.

Thirty-eight percent odds.

Better than zero.

Worse than comfortable.

Exactly what we'd chosen.

Two minutes.

I looked at the survivors. At Reyes. At Kim. At Elena and the remaining Recursionists.

"Thank you. For defending this. For believing this matters. For witnessing our choice."

"Close the loop," Reyes said. "Make everyone's sacrifice count."

"Honor Soren's faith," Elena added. "Prove determinism can be sacred."

One minute.

The timeline screamed. Demanding closure. Demanding resolution.

We'd give it what it needed.

Or disperse trying.

Thirty seconds.

Cassandra's ring caught light. Gold band. Visible proof of choice. Commitment made before knowing outcome.

Observer effect as marriage vow.

Faith as quantum collapse.

Love as force that bent probability.

Ten seconds.

Forty deaths. Three hundred sacrifices. Eight billion futures. Thirteen months of fragmenting. Two years of separation. Hours of dispersal.

All of it leading here.

Five seconds.

"I love you," I said.

"Tell me after we close the loop. After we honor everyone. After we discover if thirty-eight percent was enough."

Three seconds.

The device completed activation.

Reality shattered.

Consciousness dispersed.

And we jumped—

Together—

Into 1977—

One final time—

To close the loop—

Or die trying—
