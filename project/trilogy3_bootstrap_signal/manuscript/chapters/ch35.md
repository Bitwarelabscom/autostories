# Chapter 35: Obligation and Hope

**Oakland, California - Recursionist Facility**
**July 19, 2030 - 7:33 PM**

I proposed to Cassandra on the roof, exactly as the probability branches had shown.

It wasn't elaborate. No restaurant, no ring hidden in champagne glass, no public declaration. Just us at sunset, the timeline showing this was the moment that mattered.

"I need to ask you something," I said.

She looked up from the tablet where she'd been reviewing temporal calculations. "The device calibrations can wait."

"Not about the device. About us. About making permanent what quantum mechanics already formalized."

She set down the tablet. "You're proposing."

"Does it count as proposal if you already know it's coming via probability projection?"

"Depends on whether you do it properly."

I got down on one knee. The roof's surface was still warm from day's heat. Oakland spread out below us, eight billion people existing because 300 chose to cease.

"Cassandra Wright. We're already quantum entangled. Already observer and observed. Already married in every way that matters at fundamental physical level. But you said ceremony matters. That marking moments makes them real. So I'm asking. Will you remarry me? Acknowledge formally what we've become? Make legal what's already true across probability space?"

She smiled, and I saw the timeline branches collapse. This moment becoming singular. Definite. Real.

"Yes. Absolutely yes. On one condition."

"What condition?"

"We do it before the temporal jump. Before you go to 1977. I need legal and ceremonial certainty before you scatter your consciousness across five decades."

"Deal. When?"

"August 1st. Gives us time to arrange something meaningful but doesn't wait so long we miss the window due to timeline complications."

"August 1st. Two weeks from now."

"You'll still want this in two weeks? When probability branches have shifted?"

"I'll want this in every timeline that exists. You're my anchor. My observer. My reason for maintaining coherence. I'd want this if reality was fragmenting tomorrow."

She pulled me up, kissed me. "Then we're engaged. Again. Properly this time."

"Quantum mechanics and traditional ceremony."

"The best kind of marriage."

We sat together on the roof, watching Oakland transition to evening. The wedding would be small. Recursionists as witnesses. Chen officiating since she had online ordination. Soren providing theological blessing. Nothing elaborate, but meaningful.

"Do you think they'd approve?" Cassandra asked.

"Who?"

"The 300. Would they think getting married is appropriate when we're carrying their extinction?"

I thought about Dr. Chen and Dr. Park. The conversations over quantum link. Their insistence that we make the bootstrap timeline worth their sacrifice.

"They'd insist on it. They wanted us to live deliberately. To make our existence meaningful. Getting married is choosing meaning. Choosing relationship that anchors mission."

"Or it's distraction from mission prep."

"It's two hours of ceremony followed by return to work. That's not distraction. That's marking significant relationship evolution that directly affects mission success probability."

"You're using probability models to justify wedding."

"I'm using probability models for everything else. Why not this?"

She laughed. "Fair point. Okay. August 1st. Small ceremony. Then back to timeline navigation."

"But first—" I pulled up my tablet, showed her the latest probability projections. "We need to discuss what happens after loop closure."

"After 1977?"

"After we successfully embed signal and stabilize timeline. What do we do with rest of our lives knowing we're living in reality that only exists because 300 people chose to erase themselves?"

She was quiet. We'd been so focused on closing loop that we hadn't discussed what came after. What life looked like in stable bootstrap timeline where mission was complete.

"We live deliberately," she said finally. "Honor the gift through how we exist. Make our choices meaningful. Create value that justifies 300 extinctions."

"That's enormous pressure."

"It's appropriate pressure. We're alive because they died. That's not obligation we can set down."

"So we carry 300 ghosts forever."

"We carry 300 reasons to make our lives count. That's different from haunting. That's inspiration."

I thought about it. After loop closure, after timeline stabilized, we'd still exist in reality built on original timeline's sacrifice. That wouldn't change. The obligation wouldn't end just because mission was complete.

"What if we fail to live meaningfully enough?" I asked. "What if post-mission life is mundane? What if we close the loop and then just... exist without the weight of navigating probability branches?"

"Then we find new weight. New meaning. We've learned to live with existential stakes. We can apply that to whatever comes next."

"Assuming timeline stabilizes and we don't fragment across probability foam."

"Assuming that, yes."

We sat watching the sunset paint Oakland in gold and shadow. Two weeks until wedding. Six months until temporal window to 1977. Then loop closure, timeline stabilization, and whatever life looked like after saving humanity.

So many milestones ahead.

So many probability branches still to navigate.

"I love you," I said. "Not just because you're my anchor. I love you for being willing to plan wedding while we're trying to prevent extinction. For treating quantum entanglement and traditional ceremony as equally important. For carrying the weight of 300 ghosts with me."

"I love you for proposing on a roof at sunset because probability branches said it mattered. For maintaining coherence across timelines while still being romantic. For turning obligation into meaning instead of burden."

"Quantum romance."

"Best kind."

We stayed on the roof until dark. Planning wedding. Discussing probability futures. Marking this moment as singular even though we existed across superposition.

August 1st. We'd get married.

Then January 2032. Temporal jump to 1977.

Then loop closure. Timeline stabilization. Making 300 deaths meaningful through eight billion lives.

And after that...

After that, we'd figure it out.

One milestone at a time.

One probability branch at a time.

One choice to make existence count instead of just exist.

The 300 had given us that option.

Had erased themselves so we could choose meaning.

Had died so we could live deliberately.

The least we could do was make it count.

Starting with wedding.

Continuing with loop closure.

Ending with lifetime of honoring the gift.

It was appropriate weight.

Heavy but bearable.

Crushing but meaningful.

The best kind of obligation.

The kind that made existence matter.
