# Chapter 1: The Impossible Data

The rain didn't care about my problems.

It hammered against the observatory dome like it had somewhere important to be, each drop a tiny messenger of entropy doing its thermodynamic duty. I'd been staring at the same sequence of numbers for six hours, and they still refused to make sense. Or rather, they made perfect sense, which was the problem.

The coffee had gone cold three cups ago. I drank it anyway.

My father used to say that free will was the lie we told ourselves to avoid acknowledging we were machines. Meat computers running deterministic code, pretending our outputs weren't predetermined by our inputs. He'd been a philosophy professor specializing in compatibilism, which meant he got paid to argue that we could be both free and trapped simultaneously. The academic equivalent of having your cake and eating it too, except the cake was made of paradoxes and tasted like ashes.

He died thinking he'd won the argument.

I was about to prove him right in ways that would have terrified him.

The signal from Voyager 2 had arrived three weeks ago. Not the usual carrier wave telemetry we'd been tracking since 1977, but something new. Something hidden in the subharmonics, buried so deep in the noise that our standard analysis protocols had missed it entirely. I'd only found it because I'd been running a custom filter looking for potential gravitational lensing artifacts.

What I found instead was a message.

Not from aliens. That would have been easier to accept.

The data was structured as a mathematical proof. Elegant, compact, undeniable. It described a unified field theory that reconciled quantum mechanics with general relativity using a framework that wouldn't be developed by humanity until 2045. I knew this because the proof referenced papers that didn't exist yet, cited researchers who were currently in graduate school, and built on experimental results from particle accelerators that were still being designed.

I'd verified the math seventeen times. It was correct.

More than correct. It was beautiful in the way that truth is beautiful when it doesn't care whether you're ready for it.

The implications sat in my stomach like lead.

Either humanity had already developed this physics by 2045 and somehow sent the proof back in time to be embedded in Voyager 2's systems before its 1977 launch, or...

Or what? Aliens who happened to know the exact trajectory of humanity's future scientific development? A cosmic coincidence that decided to manifest as a perfectly formatted academic paper?

I pulled out my notebook, the one I'd been keeping since grad school. Flipped past pages of signal analysis, frequency plots, half-finished theorems. Found a blank page and wrote:

*Bootstrap paradox: Information with no origin point. Effect precedes cause. The snake eating its own tail.*

My father's voice in my head: "If you can predict the future from the past, then the future was always determined. Choice is illusion, Elliot. Mathematics doesn't lie."

I underlined the words twice, pressing hard enough that the pen tore through the paper.

The lab was empty at this hour. Just me and the ambient hum of servers processing data from telescopes pointed at distant stars, searching for patterns that would tell us we weren't alone. The irony wasn't lost on me. We'd been looking outward for decades, and the signal that mattered had been riding in our own spacecraft all along.

I pulled up the next layer of the signal.

If the first layer was a physics proof, the second layer was a blueprint. Schematics for a device I didn't recognize. Quantum computing architecture, but configured in ways that suggested applications beyond computational power. The notation used terminology I'd never seen before: "temporal interface," "causality anchor," "probability collapse chamber."

The device appeared to be designed to do something with time.

My hands were shaking. I blamed the caffeine.

The third layer was encrypted. Military-grade, or something beyond it. I'd been trying to crack it for two days with no success. Whatever was buried in that layer, someone had wanted it protected. Someone who understood cryptography that wouldn't be invented for another decade.

I sat back, rubbing my eyes until phosphenes danced in the darkness.

The rational explanations were exhausted. I'd tried them all. Coding error in the analysis software. Contamination in the signal. Elaborate hoax by someone with access to SETI's systems and a graduate degree in theoretical physics. Each possibility collapsed under the weight of the evidence.

What remained was impossible.

And impossibility, I was learning, had a taste. Copper and electricity, like licking a battery. The flavor of causality folding back on itself.

I opened a new file and began documenting everything. If I was going insane, at least I'd do it methodically. Started with the timeline:

*Voyager 2 launched: August 20, 1977*
*Signal received by SETI: September 23, 2029*
*First anomaly detected: October 14, 2029*
*Bootstrap data confirmed: October 17, 2029*

Then the evidence:

*Layer 1: Unified field theory (verified against current physics - mathematically sound but requires knowledge not available until 2045)*
*Layer 2: Quantum device blueprints (purpose unknown, components identifiable)*
*Layer 3: Encrypted payload (unbreakable with current methods)*

And finally, the conclusion I didn't want to write:

*The signal appears to contain information from Earth's own future, embedded in Voyager 2 before launch. This should not be possible. This is not possible. This is.*

My father used to play a game with me when I was young. He'd set up dominoes in elaborate patterns, then ask me which one I'd choose to knock down first. I'd deliberate, weighing options, feeling the weight of choice. Then he'd smile and say, "But I already knew which one you'd pick. I set them up that way."

I'd hated that game.

I closed my eyes and saw the signal in my mind's eye, its structure like a message in a bottle thrown from tomorrow. Someone had sent this. Someone who knew exactly when and how we'd find it. Someone who understood that Voyager 2 would still be transmitting in 2029, that SETI would be listening, that I would be the one running the analysis on this particular night.

The predestination made my skin crawl.

My phone buzzed. A text from an unknown number:

*Stop looking at the signal. You're not ready for what it means.*

I stared at the screen. Three weeks of secrecy. I'd told no one about the anomaly, followed protocol by keeping preliminary findings classified until peer review. So who knew I was looking?

Someone who had access to SETI's internal systems. Or someone who had already lived through this moment and knew exactly when I'd find the data.

I typed back: *Who is this?*

The response came immediately:

*Someone trying to prevent what happened in the other timelines. Don't go to work tomorrow. They're coming for you.*

I set the phone down like it might explode.

Other timelines. They're coming for you.

The words hung in the air like smoke, dissipating into possibility.

I turned back to my monitor, where the signal data scrolled past in endless rows of numbers. Somewhere in that stream of information was a message from the future, from a version of humanity that had learned to reach backward through time. And if they could send information back, what else could they send?

Warnings. Instructions. Lies.

I thought about my father's dominoes. The illusion of choice in a predetermined pattern.

But here's what he never considered: even if you know which domino will fall, someone still has to push it. The fact that something is determined doesn't mean it doesn't matter. The path might be set, but you still have to walk it.

I saved my documentation to three separate encrypted drives, then uploaded a copy to a private server I'd set up years ago for backing up research. If something happened to me, if the mysterious texter was right and "they" were coming, at least the data would survive.

Then I did something I hadn't done in two years.

I called Cassandra.

She answered on the fourth ring, her voice thick with sleep. "Elliot? It's three in the morning."

"I know. I'm sorry. I just..." I paused, unsure how to explain. "I found something. In the Voyager signal. Something impossible."

Silence on the other end. I could picture her sitting up in bed, that precise mind already spinning up to full speed. We'd been divorced for two years, but I still knew how she thought. Quantum physicist, specialist in observer effect and probability collapse. If anyone would understand what I was seeing, it would be her.

"Impossible like 'statistically unlikely' or impossible like 'this violates causality'?" she asked.

"The second one."

Another pause. Longer this time.

"Send me the data," she said finally. "And Elliot? Be careful. If you've found what I think you've found, you're not going to be the only one looking for it."

"Someone already texted me a warning. Told me not to come to work tomorrow."

"Then don't." Her voice was sharp now, fully awake. "Come to my lab. We'll look at this together."

"Cass, I don't want to drag you into—"

"You already did. The moment you called me at three AM, you dragged me in. So stop being a martyr and let me help you figure out what the hell you've stumbled into."

I felt something unknot in my chest. Relief, maybe. Or just the exhaustion of carrying this alone for three weeks.

"Okay," I said. "I'll be there at seven."

"Make it six. If someone's watching you, earlier is better."

She hung up.

I looked back at the screen, at the impossible data that had rewritten my understanding of reality in the space of three weeks. Bootstrap paradox. Information with no origin. A closed causal loop where effect created cause created effect in an infinite regression.

My father's voice again: "Free will is the lie we tell ourselves."

But here's the thing about lies, Dad. Sometimes they're the only thing keeping you sane.

I shut down my terminal, wiped the local cache, and gathered my research. The rain had stopped, leaving the world outside washed clean and uncertain. Somewhere in that clean uncertainty, the future was reaching back toward the past, and I was caught in the middle.

The dominoes were already falling.

I just had to decide whether I was one of them, or the hand that pushed them.

The problem, of course, was that in a bootstrap paradox, I might be both.

I walked out of the lab into the pre-dawn darkness, carrying the weight of tomorrow's knowledge in my bag. Behind me, the servers continued their quiet work, processing signals from the cosmos, searching for meaning in the void.

They'd already found it.

We just hadn't understood yet that the void was staring back from our own future, wearing our own face.
