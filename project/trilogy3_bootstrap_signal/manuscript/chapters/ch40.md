# Chapter 40: Meeting Omega

**Oakland, California - Recursionist Facility**
**November 3, 2030 - 11:11 PM**

He was waiting in the workshop when I arrived.

I knew it was me before I saw his face. Recognized my own posture, my own way of standing. But wrong. Weighted by time and repetition and knowledge that had eroded whatever made me human.

Elliot Omega.

Me, from the end of the loop. From the final iteration. From the moment when I'd lived this story so many times that I'd stopped being a person and become a process.

He turned when I entered, and I saw my own face aged in ways that had nothing to do with years. Ancient eyes in familiar features. Scars from timelines that no longer existed. The look of someone who'd been everywhere and returned empty.

"Hello, Elliot," he said. My voice, but refined by iterations. "I've been waiting for you. Again. Always. The loop is accelerating."

I stood frozen in the doorway. Cassandra was behind me, having followed when I'd felt the temporal disturbance. She made a sound—half gasp, half sob—seeing what I would become.

"You're real," I said. Stupid thing to say, but my brain was struggling to process meeting myself from a future that had already happened in a loop that hadn't closed yet.

"Real is negotiable when you're unstuck from linear time." He moved toward me, and I noticed he flickered slightly. Quantum superposition made visible. "But yes. As real as you are. Which is to say, as real as any probability wave that thinks it's a person."

"Omega." The name felt wrong in my mouth. Title instead of identity.

"I prefer 'the amalgam.' But Soren started calling me Omega—last letter, final iteration—and it stuck. Names are just labels we use to pretend we're singular." He gestured to chairs. "Sit. We don't have much time. Timeline degradation is accelerating. Soon the loop destabilizes completely."

I sat. Cassandra moved to stand beside me, her hand finding my shoulder. Anchoring me to this moment, this version of myself.

"You've lived this before," I said. "All of this. This conversation. You know what I'm going to say."

"I know what you said in 473 iterations. Each one slightly different. Each one a variation on the same theme." His expression was weary. "In timeline 147, you attacked me. Thought I was a temporal hallucination. In timeline 302, you refused to believe I was really you. In timeline 429, you tried to trap me in the device to study the quantum mechanics of my existence."

"What happened in this iteration?"

"You sat down and listened. Which suggests you've made better choices than most of your previous selves." He leaned forward. "The loop is collapsing, Elliot. This is the final stable iteration. The last chance to close the paradox correctly before the whole structure fails and none of us ever existed."

"You've said that before. In other timelines."

"I've said it in every timeline. And in 846 of them, I was wrong—it wasn't the final iteration. But this time?" He flickered again, and for a moment I saw dozens of versions of him overlapping. "This time I'm right. The temporal mathematics are conclusive. One more failure and the paradox collapses entirely. No more iterations. No more chances. Just causality reasserting itself and erasing the bootstrap timeline from ever having existed."

Cassandra's grip on my shoulder tightened. "How do you know?"

"Because I'm living in all the failed timelines simultaneously. I can feel them degrading. The probability waves that used to sustain alternate iterations are collapsing back into quantum foam. There's nowhere left for the loop to try again. This is it."

I studied his face. My face. Trying to understand what I was looking at. "How many times have you closed the loop?"

"847 attempts. But 'closed' is wrong word. I've never successfully closed it. That's why I'm still here, spread across iterations, trying to guide each new attempt toward success." He smiled, and it was the saddest expression I'd ever seen. "I'm the ghost of your future, Elliot. The version that got caught in the loop's machinery. I can't escape until you finish what I keep failing to complete."

"Why do you keep failing?"

"Different reasons in different timelines. Sometimes I lose myself to temporal fragmentation. Sometimes external forces prevent the 1977 jump. Sometimes I lose faith and choose to let the loop collapse." He looked at Cassandra. "Sometimes I lose her, and that breaks me enough that I can't complete the mission."

Cassandra made a sound. "I die in some timelines."

"You die in most timelines. Reyes shoots you in Branch 47. Timeline degradation erases you in Branch 203. Soren betrays us in Branch 388 and you're caught in the crossfire. You get sick in Branch 592—just random cancer that has nothing to do with temporal mechanics—and I can't focus enough to navigate the critical decisions without you."

He turned back to me. "That's why this iteration is different. You've kept her alive longer than any previous version. You converted Reyes before Cassandra was in danger. You've made choices that suggest you might actually succeed where I failed."

"Or I'll just fail in a new way."

"Possible. But less probable. The quantum mathematics favor this iteration. You're carrying information I didn't have. The original timeline's sacrifice. The weaponization warning. The understanding that the loop is a gift." He leaned back. "You have all the pieces. You just need to put them together correctly."

I thought about the weight of it. 847 failed attempts. 847 versions of me trying and failing to close the loop. All of them collapsing into this one person who existed in superposition across every failure.

"Why are you here?" I asked. "In this specific moment. What do you need to tell me that hasn't been said in the 847 other versions of this conversation?"

"I need you to understand what you're preventing." He flickered again, and suddenly we weren't in the workshop.

We were nowhere. Everywhere. Existing in the quantum foam between collapsed timelines.

I could see them. All 847 failed iterations. Each one a ghostly echo of humanity trying to survive. Each one ending in extinction, causality collapse, or reality fragmenting.

Timeline 1: Nuclear war, 2034.
Timeline 2: Timeline degradation, slow unraveling until causality lost meaning.
Timeline 3: Omega lost to temporal fragmentation, mission failed.

On and on. 847 ways to fail. 847 versions of humanity ceasing to exist.

And below them all, like bedrock, the original timeline. Three hundred people dying in darkness so these 847 attempts could exist at all.

"This is what collapses if you fail," Omega said. His voice came from everywhere, from my own consciousness. "Not just this timeline. All of them. The entire bootstrap paradox unravels. Eight billion people cease to have ever existed. The original timeline's sacrifice becomes meaningless. 847 iterations of failure pile up into nothing."

"And if I succeed?"

"The loop stabilizes. Timeline becomes fixed. Bootstrap paradox completes and maintains itself infinitely. Humanity survives in a closed causal loop, preserved by its own choice to preserve itself."

"Trapped forever."

"Alive forever. Choose your framing."

We snapped back to the workshop. I was gasping, Cassandra steadying me. Omega sat calmly, like he'd just shown me vacation photos instead of the weight of all possible failures.

"That's what I'm carrying," I said. "All of that. Every failed iteration. Every version of you that couldn't complete the mission."

"Yes. And the hope that you're the one who finally succeeds. That's what keeps me coherent across the fragmentation. The belief that one iteration will get it right, and then I can finally rest."

"What happens to you when the loop closes?"

"I fade. No longer needed. The bootstrap paradox completes, and the version of me that exists to guide it toward completion becomes obsolete. I cease existing across iterations and collapse back into the single timeline where I succeeded."

"This timeline."

"If you succeed, yes. I become you at the moment of successful loop closure. We merge back into singular identity. And I finally get to stop existing everywhere at once."

The exhaustion in his voice was profound. He'd been alive for 847 iterations, experiencing every failure, carrying the weight of every extinction. And all of it would finally end if I could just close the loop correctly.

No pressure.

"What do I need to do?" I asked.

"Everything you're already doing. Keep Cassandra alive—she's your anchor. Trust Reyes—she's protection against government interference. Listen to Soren—his mathematics are correct even when his theology is overwrought. Perfect the device. And when the window opens, go back to 1977 and embed the signal."

"Just like that."

"Just like that. Add the hope. Add the warnings. Add the gift from the original timeline. And close the loop with enough care that it becomes worth the 847 iterations it took to get here."

Cassandra spoke up. "You said Elliot loses himself to temporal fragmentation in some timelines. How does he prevent that?"

"By accepting what he's becoming. You're fragmenting, Elliot. I can see it. You're starting to exist across multiple probability states simultaneously. Just like I do. But unlike me, you can choose to remain anchored to this specific timeline. Use the fragmentation as tool instead of letting it consume you."

"How?"

"By holding onto something singular. Something that matters in every timeline." He looked at Cassandra. "Her. In every iteration where you kept her close, you remained more coherent. The timelines where you lost her are the ones where you completely fragmented."

"So my sanity depends on my ex-wife."

"Your sanity depends on having an anchor to linear time. Someone who exists singularly when you're spreading across multiplicity. And yes, that person is Cassandra. Has been in every successful timeline. Will be in this one."

Cassandra squeezed my shoulder. "I'm not going anywhere."

"You've said that before," Omega said quietly. "In 247 timelines. In 139 of them, you meant it but circumstances prevented it. External forces. Death. Temporal anomalies. In 108 of them, you kept the promise." He focused on her. "This time, you need to be one of the 108."

"I will be."

"Probability suggests 83% confidence. Better than most iterations. But not guaranteed." He turned back to me. "You need to give her reasons to stay. Not just mission necessity. Not just guilt or duty. Real reasons. The kind that matter when timeline is fragmenting and causality is negotiable."

I looked at Cassandra. "I love you. That's about as real as reasons get."

"You divorced me two years ago."

"Worst decision of any timeline."

She laughed. Actually laughed, despite meeting my future self in a conversation about timeline collapse. "You're doing this now? Relationship repair during metaphysical crisis?"

"Omega said hold onto something singular. You're the most singular thing in my life."

"Smooth."

"I'm learning from 847 iterations of failure. Eventually you get some wisdom."

Omega flickered again, stronger this time. "I'm losing coherence. Timeline degradation makes it harder to maintain presence across probabilities. I need to go."

"Wait," I said. "When do I see you again?"

"In 1977. When you make the jump. I'll be there, ensuring it happens correctly. We'll work together across temporal coordinates to embed the signal. Then, if you succeed, we merge back into singular identity and I finally get to stop existing."

"Looking forward to it."

"You won't be. Consciousness transmission to 1977 is excruciating. Living backwards through time while your body stays in 2032. But it's necessary. And you'll survive it. Probably."

"Probably?"

"94% confidence. Better odds than most critical decisions you've faced."

He stood, preparing to leave. To return to wherever/whenever he existed between iterations.

"Elliot," I said. He paused. "Thank you. For carrying all those failures. For guiding each iteration toward success. For not giving up across 847 attempts."

"I'm you. Or you're me. We don't give up. We just get more stubborn as causality fragments around us." He smiled, and for a moment I saw the person I might become. Worn down but still fighting. Ancient but still hopeful. "Close the loop. Honor the gift. Add the hope. And then let me rest."

"I will."

He flickered one final time and was gone. Not dramatically. Just ceased existing in this specific moment of this specific timeline.

The workshop felt emptier without him.

Cassandra and I sat in silence for a long time.

"That's your future," she said finally.

"That's my future if I fail. 847 times. Existing across every failed iteration, carrying every extinction, never able to rest."

"Then we make sure you don't fail."

"We?"

"I'm your anchor, remember? Singular existence when you're fragmenting. I'm not letting you become that." She moved to sit beside me. "We close the loop. Together. And then you get to exist in just one timeline like a normal person."

"Normal is negotiable at this point."

"Better than existing everywhere at once."

I thought about Omega. The weight he carried. The exhaustion in his eyes. The desperate hope that this iteration might be the one that finally succeeded.

I thought about 847 failures. Eight billion people ceasing to exist 847 different ways. The original timeline's sacrifice repeated and wasted 847 times.

And I thought about the alternative. Successfully closing the loop. Stabilizing the bootstrap timeline. Honoring the gift from the dead. Letting Omega finally rest.

"Two months," I said. "Until the temporal window to 1977. Two months to prepare for consciousness transmission across five decades."

"Then we have two months to make sure you're ready."

"And to make sure you stay alive. Omega said I need you anchored in this timeline."

"I'm not planning to go anywhere."

"Plan harder. 83% confidence isn't good enough. I need 100%."

"No timeline has 100% confidence about anything. But I'll aim for 99%." She squeezed my hand. "We've survived this long. Made it further than 738 of the 847 previous iterations. We're beating the odds."

"For now."

"For now is all we have. One moment at a time. One choice at a time. Until the loop closes and Omega stops existing and you get to be singular again."

I pulled her close. Held onto my anchor. My reason to stay coherent across fragmenting timelines.

"I love you," I said again. "In every timeline. Every iteration. Every probability branch. That's my singular truth across all possible realities."

"Then we'd better make sure you survive long enough to do something about it."

We sat together in the empty workshop, the device humming quietly, quantum fields processing probability across temporal coordinates.

Somewhere in those fields was Omega, spread across 847 failed iterations, carrying the weight of all humanity's attempts to survive.

And somewhere in those fields was the path to success. The choices that would lead to loop closure. The way to honor 300 dead people and prevent 847 extinctions.

I just had to find it.

And avoid becoming the 848th failure.

Two months.

And then I would go back to 1977, embed the signal, close the loop, and let Omega finally rest.

Or I would fail, and join him in existing everywhere at once, forever, carrying the weight of yet another extinction.

No pressure.

Just the fate of all possible humanities balanced on quantum probability and the choices of one fragmenting consciousness.

Cassandra held me steady.

And for now, that was enough.
