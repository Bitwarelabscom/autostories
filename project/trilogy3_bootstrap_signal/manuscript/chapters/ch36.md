# Chapter 36: Reyes Triangulation

**Oakland, California - Recursionist Facility**
**August 12, 2030 - 3:41 PM**

The wedding had been eleven days ago. We'd returned to work the next day. And now federal surveillance was tightening around the Oakland facility.

I could see it in the probability branches. Reyes' team was triangulating our location through multiple data streams. We had maybe a week before they raided the facility.

"We could relocate again," Chen suggested during afternoon strategy session. "Move to Seattle safe house. Reset her tracking."

"That buys us three weeks maximum," I said, showing the probability models. "She's too close. Too many data points. Whatever we do, she finds us by September."

Soren frowned at the calculations. "So we accelerate the mission. Complete device prep early. Attempt temporal jump before she can interfere."

"We're not ready. Device needs four more months of refinement. Attempting jump now has 23% success probability. That's unacceptable risk."

Cassandra studied the timeline branches. "What if we let her catch us?"

Everyone turned to look at her.

"Explain," I said.

"The probability models show Reyes capturing us in late August or early September regardless of evasive action. We've been treating that as failure state. But what if it's necessary state? What if being captured is how we convert her from hunter to ally?"

I pulled up the relevant timelines. Experienced the probability branches where we were captured.

In most, it led to Branch 47. Weaponization. Extinction.

But in some—small probability cloud, maybe 7%—capture led to conversation. Led to me proving Marcus existed. Led to Reyes switching sides.

"It's low probability," I said. "7% chance that capture leads to alliance instead of weaponization."

"But 100% probability we get captured eventually if current trajectory holds. So we can evade until we're captured unprepared, or we can prepare for capture and try to navigate the 7% branch."

Soren didn't like it. "You're suggesting we surrender to federal agents?"

"I'm suggesting we stop running and start navigating. Elliot's superposition perception lets him observe probability branches in real-time. If we know capture is coming, we can prepare. Can load the probability toward the 7% branch where Reyes becomes ally."

I experienced the timelines more deeply. Saw the capture scenarios unfold.

In unprepared capture, we were scattered across multiple locations. Device was seized incomplete. Interrogation happened before I could establish meaningful contact with Reyes. Led to Branch 47.

But in prepared capture, we were together. Device was secured separately. I had time to talk to Reyes before her superiors arrived. Opportunity to show her Marcus. To demonstrate the weaponization timeline. To convert her from antagonist to ally.

7% was still terrible odds.

But it was better than 0%.

"How do we prepare for capture?" Chen asked.

I mapped the optimal approach. "We secure the device in off-site location. Somewhere Reyes won't find it immediately but we can retrieve after conversion. We stay at Oakland facility. Let her team track us here. When raid happens, we don't resist. I request private conversation with Reyes before federal custody. Use that window to show her Marcus. To convert her."

"And if it doesn't work?" Soren asked.

"Then we're in federal custody. Branch 47 becomes likely. Weaponization timeline. Extinction."

"Unacceptable risk."

"Compared to continuing evasion that leads to disorganized capture with 0% conversion probability? 7% is better than 0%."

Cassandra pulled up more calculations. "We can increase the 7%. Elliot can navigate the conversation in superposition. See Reyes' probability branches in real-time. Adjust approach based on which timeline has highest conversion probability."

"That's manipulative," Chen observed.

"That's navigating. We've been using superposition perception for every other critical decision. Why not this one?"

Because this one felt different. More personal. I'd be reading Reyes' probability branches—her potential reactions—and manipulating the conversation toward desired outcome.

But we'd been doing that for months. Every critical choice was manipulated via probability observation. Reyes was just another timeline branch to navigate.

"Okay," I said. "We prepare for conversion-oriented capture. Secure device off-site. I practice the conversation. We load probability toward the 7% branch."

"When?" Soren asked.

I checked the timeline projections. "Reyes raids Oakland facility August 19th if we stay here. That's one week from today. We have seven days to prepare."

Seven days to set up optimal capture scenario.

Seven days to practice showing Reyes her displaced partner.

Seven days to increase 7% probability to something survivable.

Seven days to convert our primary hunter into our most valuable ally.

Or seven days until Branch 47 became inevitable.

We spent the week preparing.

Device moved to Berkeley safe house Chen had established months ago. Hidden well enough Reyes wouldn't find it immediately but accessible if conversion succeeded.

I practiced the conversation. Entered superposition, experienced different approaches to showing Reyes that Marcus existed. Found the probability branches where she believed me. Where trauma turned to alliance instead of anger.

Cassandra anchored me through the practice sessions. Witnessed me navigating imaginary conversations. Helped refine the approach.

"You need to show her Marcus immediately," she said after one session. "Don't build up to it. Don't explain quantum mechanics first. Just prove he exists. Everything else follows from that proof."

She was right. The probability branches where I led with Marcus had highest conversion rate. Reyes needed evidence before she could process explanation.

By August 18th, I'd increased the conversion probability from 7% to 14%. Still terrible odds. But better.

"Tomorrow," I said that evening. We were in our room—married eleven days, and the novelty of saying "our room" still felt significant. "Reyes raids tomorrow afternoon. Are we ready?"

Cassandra checked her tablet. "Device secured in Berkeley. Recursionist evacuation plan ready—Soren and most members will disperse when raid begins. Chen stays with us for credibility. Your conversation approach is optimized. Ready as we'll get."

"14% probability of conversion."

"86% probability of capture leading to Branch 47."

"Not reassuring odds."

"Better than certainty of disorganized capture. We've navigated worse probability branches."

I pulled up the superposition perception. Experienced tomorrow afternoon. Saw the raid unfold across multiple timelines.

Federal agents. Reyes leading. Recursionists scattering. Chen, Cassandra, and I staying behind. Allowing capture. Requesting private conversation.

Then branching. In 86% of timelines, Reyes refused or her superiors intervened before I could show Marcus. Led to federal custody. Weaponization. Extinction.

But in 14%, she gave me ten minutes. Private interrogation room. Chance to activate device's remote interface. Show her Branch 73 where Marcus existed.

14% where trauma became proof.

14% where alliance became possible.

14% where we might survive.

"I can navigate this," I said. "Can observe her probability branches in real-time. Adjust conversation toward conversion timeline."

"You've practiced."

"Yes."

"You're ready."

"No. But I'm prepared. There's a difference."

She kissed me. Anchoring gesture. "Then we trust the preparation. Trust your superposition navigation. Trust that 14% is enough probability to collapse into reality."

"And if it's not?"

"Then we tried. Made the best choice with available information. That's all we can do."

I held her close. Tomorrow we'd be captured. Tomorrow I'd attempt to convert our hunter. Tomorrow the timeline would branch toward alliance or extinction.

14% probability.

86% failure.

Terrible odds for saving humanity.

But the only odds we had.

"I love you," I said. "If tomorrow goes wrong—if we end up in federal custody and I can't convert Reyes—I need you to know that. That you were my anchor. That you kept me coherent. That you made quantum existence bearable."

"If tomorrow goes wrong, we'll be in federal custody together. You can tell me directly."

"Probably not. They'll separate us for interrogation."

"Then I'll assume you love me even when we're separated. Quantum entanglement doesn't end just because federal agents interfere."

"Observer and observed."

"Gift recipients and gift preservers."

We spent our last free evening in the Oakland facility quietly. No grand gestures. Just presence. Anchoring each other before the probability storm.

Tomorrow we'd navigate the most critical conversation of the mission.

Tomorrow I'd try to turn 14% probability into certainty.

Tomorrow Reyes would either become ally or lead us toward Branch 47's extinction.

Tomorrow we'd learn if preparation could overcome terrible odds.

14%.

It would have to be enough.

Because it was all we had.
