# Chapter 7: Excavating Belief

**San Jose, California - Safe House**
**October 25, 2029 - 11:52 PM**

I couldn't sleep, so I investigated the people trying to save my soul.

The Recursionists left digital footprints like anyone else. Academic papers. Conference presentations. Old social media profiles from before they disappeared into Soren's orbit. I'd spent the last six hours excavating their past lives, trying to understand how rational people became a cult worshipping causality.

The answer, it turned out, was physics.

Dr. Marcus Soren's downfall was documented with academic precision. I found his original paper from 2019: "Observable Evidence of Retrocausal Information Transfer in Quantum Systems." Published in a respectable journal. Peer-reviewed. Mathematically sound.

And completely career-destroying.

The responses came swift and brutal. "Soren's temporal fantasies," one reviewer called it. "Mathematics in search of a phenomenon that doesn't exist." His university put him on administrative leave. His funding evaporated. Colleagues distanced themselves.

But I'd read the paper now. With the benefit of knowing the bootstrap paradox was real.

Soren had been right.

He'd found evidence of information flowing backward through time in quantum experiments. Nothing dramatic—just statistical anomalies in particle behavior that suggested retrocausal influence. Observer effect, but the observer was in the future.

The physics community had dismissed it as experimental error.

Soren had built a religion around it instead.

I pulled up the next file. Sarah Chen. PhD in theoretical physics from Caltech. Her dissertation on quantum entanglement across temporal coordinates had been rejected twice before a sympathetic committee let it pass with severe caveats. No job offers. No postdoc positions. Academia had collectively decided her ideas were too fringe.

Then Soren had found her work and told her she was right.

The pattern repeated. Dr. Yuki Chen—MIT, discredited for publishing data on probability manipulation. James Torres—Stanford, forced out for claiming causality could be observed violating temporal order. Aria Okonkwo—Cambridge, blacklisted for theoretical work on consciousness existing across multiple timeline states.

All of them brilliant.

All of them correct, if the Voyager signal was any indication.

All of them destroyed by an academic system that couldn't accommodate ideas too far outside the paradigm.

So they'd found each other. Built a community around their shared exile. And transformed their vindication into theology.

I understood the impulse. When everyone calls you crazy and you know you're right, belief becomes identity. Truth becomes sacred. And the people who believe you become congregation.

Still unsettling. Still cultish.

But more sympathetic than I wanted to admit.

My laptop pinged. Cassandra, sending me a file from the other room. She was still awake too, apparently, analyzing the device blueprints.

The file was titled: "Recursionist Psychological Profiles - Reyes Analysis."

I opened it.

Agent Reyes' division had been tracking the Recursionists for years. Detailed dossiers on every member. Psychological assessments. Threat evaluations. The works.

"Where did you get this?" I messaged Cassandra.

"Dr. Chen. She has sources in the intelligence community. Don't ask."

I read through Reyes' analysis. She'd classified the Recursionists as a "low-threat fringe science group with concerning potential for radicalization." Not terrorists. Not criminals. Just scientists who'd gone too far down the rabbit hole and might do something desperate if they thought reality was at stake.

Which, it turned out, it was.

The profile on Soren was particularly detailed. Reyes had identified him as a "true believer type with messianic delusions about temporal mechanics." She'd noted his ability to attract followers, his charisma wrapped in mathematical certainty, his transformation of physics into faith.

But she'd also noted: "Subject's theoretical framework, while unorthodox, shows mathematical consistency. Recommend further evaluation of retrocausal claims by qualified physicists before complete dismissal."

So even Reyes thought Soren might be onto something.

That didn't make me feel better.

I dug deeper into the files. Found something that made me stop.

A sub-section titled: "Project Chronos - Classified Timeline Editing Experiments."

I clicked it open.

Redacted. Most of it blacked out. But the fragments that remained told a story:

The government had been experimenting with quantum temporal mechanics since 2024. Small-scale tests. Sending information backward through microseconds. Trying to manipulate probability outcomes in real-time.

One experiment had gone catastrophically wrong.

The details were redacted, but the aftermath wasn't. Two researchers dead. One researcher "displaced from observable timeline." Facility quarantined. Project shut down.

And in charge of the subsequent investigation: Agent Maya Reyes.

Who, according to her psychological profile, had shown signs of "temporal displacement trauma" following the incident. Who'd reported memories of events that didn't match official records. Who'd been the only one to remember a partner who'd been erased when the timeline editing went wrong.

The government had told her she'd had a psychotic break.

She'd known they were lying.

So she'd taken charge of the Temporal Anomalies Division. Hunting for proof that what she remembered was real. That her partner had existed before causality had been rewritten.

I stared at the screen, reframing everything I knew about Reyes.

She wasn't just a federal agent following orders. She was a woman whose reality had been edited out from under her, and who'd spent years trying to prove it hadn't been a delusion.

The Recursionists weren't her enemy.

They were proof she was sane.

My phone buzzed. Unknown number. But I recognized the pattern now—my future self, messaging backward through the temporal loop.

*You found the Chronos files. Good. You need to understand Reyes. She's not your enemy. She's someone fighting the same battle from a different direction. When she arrests you in three weeks, remember this: she's trying to prevent what happened to her from happening to you. She'll fail, but her intent is protection, not persecution.*

I typed back: *Then why do the probability models show timeline collapse if I go with her?*

The response came immediately:

*Because the government will weaponize the temporal mechanics. Not Reyes personally—she'd try to stop it. But the system she works for can't help itself. Future knowledge means power, and power corrupts causality. The Recursionists are fanatics, but they're right about one thing: the loop has to close before the government can monopolize what you've discovered.*

I thought about Project Chronos. About researchers dying and timelines being edited and a woman losing her partner to causality violation.

About the bootstrap paradox as the lesser evil compared to institutional control of time itself.

"Can't sleep either?"

I looked up. Cassandra stood in the doorway, holding two mugs of tea. She looked exhausted and determined in equal measure.

"Found something," I said. "Government's been experimenting with temporal mechanics since 2024. One experiment went wrong. Reyes was involved. Lost someone to timeline editing."

Cassandra handed me a mug and sat down. "That explains her psychological profile. She's not hunting the signal to suppress it. She's hunting it to understand what happened to her."

"And the Recursionists?"

"Probably knew about Project Chronos. Probably see the government experiments as proof that timeline editing is real and dangerous." She sipped her tea. "Which makes their theology more tactical than mystical. They're not worshipping causality. They're trying to close the loop before someone weaponizes it."

"Still a cult."

"Still right about the stakes." She pulled up her own research. "I've been analyzing the historical bootstrap events they documented. Cross-referencing with quantum causality models. At least forty percent of them show genuine evidence of retrocausal interference."

"Forty percent is less than half."

"Forty percent is way more than statistical noise. Elliot, if even a fraction of their historical timeline editing theory is correct, we're living in a reality that's been revised repeatedly. And each revision creates instability. Causality pressure building like a wound that won't heal."

"So the Voyager loop..."

"Is the final edit. The one that either stabilizes the timeline permanently or causes complete causal collapse. No pressure." She smiled without humor. "Just the fate of eight billion people depending on us building a time machine correctly."

I looked at my screen, at the files on the Recursionists. Brilliant people driven to extremism by being right too early. By finding truths the system wasn't ready to accommodate.

"I'm starting to sympathize with them," I admitted. "Which terrifies me."

"Good. Fear means you're still rational. It's when you start chanting probability equations that I'll worry."

"They have a point, though. About determinism and free will. About choosing your fate even when it's predetermined."

"They have several points. Wrapped in theology that makes them easier to dismiss than engage with." She set down her tea. "But we don't have to buy the full belief system to use their tools. Dr. Chen's temporal coherence protocols work whether you treat them as spiritual practice or neuroscience."

My future self texted again:

*Stop trying to categorize them as cult or colleagues. They're both. Use what helps, ignore what doesn't. You have three weeks before the first critical decision point. Learn everything you can. You'll need it all when the temporal bleeds start.*

I showed Cassandra the message.

"Your future self is very pragmatic about cult membership," she observed.

"My future self has survived temporal displacement. Probably recalibrated priorities."

We sat in comfortable silence, drinking tea, reviewing files on people who'd sacrificed their careers to chase impossible physics that turned out to be real.

"What do you think happened to Reyes' partner?" I asked eventually. "If timeline editing erased them from causality, are they... dead? Or just never existed?"

"Depends on your interpretation of quantum mechanics. Copenhagen says they never existed in this timeline. Many-worlds says they exist in a parallel probability stream. Retrocausality says they might have existed and then been edited out retroactively." She paused. "All of which is equally horrifying."

"And Reyes is the only one who remembers."

"Because she was the observer. Her consciousness preserved the memory even after the timeline was rewritten. Which proves my quantum consciousness theory, by the way. Awareness can persist across timeline edits."

"Academic vindication through temporal horror. Congrats."

"Thanks. I hate it."

We both laughed, and for a moment it felt like our marriage. Late nights discussing impossible physics. Finding humor in existential dread. Two minds tackling problems too big for one person alone.

"I miss this," I said quietly. "Working together. The way we used to."

"Me too. But Elliot, we divorced for good reasons. Your obsessions were consuming you. I couldn't watch you destroy yourself."

"And now?"

"Now you're destroying yourself anyway, but at least it's for an apocalyptically important reason instead of just academic stubbornness." She smiled sadly. "Progress?"

"Of a sort."

My laptop pinged. New message from Dr. Chen: *Meditation session tomorrow 6 AM. Soren wants you there. Practice probability coherence before temporal bleeds begin.*

I groaned. "They want me at their prayer meeting tomorrow."

"Go," Cassandra said. "Take notes. Treat it like anthropological fieldwork if that helps. But learn the techniques. When your consciousness starts fragmenting across timelines, pride won't save you. Preparation might."

She was right. I hated that she was right.

But I was learning that hating something didn't make it less true.

I messaged back: *I'll be there.*

Cassandra finished her tea and stood. "Try to sleep. Tomorrow you start becoming the person who can survive temporal displacement. That requires rest."

"Is that a neuroscience recommendation or mystical wisdom?"

"Both. Simultaneously. Welcome to bootstrap physics."

She left. I stayed up another hour, reading through Recursionist files, Reyes' psychological profiles, government experiments that had violated causality and erased people from reality.

Outside my window, the city slept. Linear lives progressing forward through time in the normal way.

I envied them.

But I was no longer one of them.

I was becoming someone else. Someone unstuck in time. Someone who'd have to learn to hold contradictory memories without fragmenting.

Someone who'd attend cult meetings at 6 AM and call it survival training.

The loop was tightening.

The theologians of causality were waiting.

And I was running out of reasons not to join them.

Even if just temporarily.

Even if just to survive what was coming.
