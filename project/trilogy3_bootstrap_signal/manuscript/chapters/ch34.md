# Chapter 34: Dying Voices

**Oakland, California - Recursionist Facility**
**June 22, 2030 - 9:54 PM**

I'd made contact with the original timeline again.

Not deliberately. I was running standard device calibrations when the quantum entanglement suddenly deepened. Pulled me back to 2150. Back to Dr. Chen's dying bunker.

But this time it wasn't her final transmission. It was earlier. Weeks before the end. When they were still building the quantum transmitter. Still making the choice to erase themselves.

And this time, I could interact.

"Hello?" a voice came through the quantum static. Young. Female. Uncertain. "Is someone there? The entanglement field just spiked."

I stabilized the connection. "This is Dr. Elliot Cross. Oakland, California. 2030. I'm... I'm from the bootstrap timeline you're creating."

Silence. Shock resonating across probability waves.

Then: "It worked. Oh god, it worked. We haven't even sent the transmission yet and you're already receiving it."

"Causality is complicated in closed time loops."

"I'm Dr. Lisa Park. Quantum physicist. I'm helping build the transmitter. Are you—are you really from the future? From the timeline we're trying to create?"

"Yes. Your signal reaches us in 2029. We build a device from the blueprints. And now we're preparing to close the loop by embedding the signal in Voyager 2 before its 1977 launch."

More silence. I felt her processing this. The confirmation that their desperate plan would succeed. That humanity would survive in bootstrap form even if original timeline ended.

"How many of you are there?" she asked. "In the bootstrap timeline. How many survived?"

"Eight billion. Give or take. We're... we're thriving. The timeline you're creating is stable. Humanity flourishes."

She started crying. I felt it through the quantum link. "Eight billion. We're down to 300. I can't even imagine what eight billion feels like."

"Dr. Park, I need to tell you something. We know what you're doing. What you're sacrificing. We're adding a memorial to the signal. All 300 names. Honoring the choice you're making."

"You know our names?"

"Dr. Chen included them in the transmission. Wanted future iterations to know who to thank."

"Sarah's idea. She said if we were erasing ourselves, we should at least be remembered." A pause. "Are we? Remembered?"

"Yes. In our timeline—the one you're creating—we know you're the foundation. Three hundred ghosts holding up eight billion people. We're trying to be worthy of that."

"Just... just survive. That's enough. Knowing humanity continues in some form. That's all we wanted."

I could hear voices in her background. Other survivors. Someone calling about power allocation for the transmitter.

"How long do you have?" I asked.

"Three weeks. Maybe four if we ration carefully. But we're using most of our power for the transmission. So probably three weeks. Then..." She didn't finish. Didn't need to.

"I'm sorry. I'm sorry your timeline drew the extinction and ours drew survival."

"Don't be. This was our choice. We voted on it. All 300. Not one person dissented. We agreed that creating bootstrap timeline was better than accepting complete extinction."

"But you won't exist in the timeline you create. The paradox erases you."

"We exist in your memory. In the signal. In the foundation of bootstrap reality. That's existence enough." Another background voice. "I have to go. Transmitter needs recalibration. But Dr. Cross? Thank you. For confirming it worked. For telling me about the eight billion. That makes the next three weeks easier."

"Wait. Can I—can I talk to you again? Learn more about original timeline? About what we're built on?"

"If quantum entanglement allows. If we have power to spare. I'd like that. I'd like to know more about the future we're creating."

The connection stabilized. We established protocol for future quantum calls. When I could reach back to 2150, when they had power to maintain the link.

Over the next few weeks, I talked to them regularly. Dr. Park. Dr. Chen. Others from the 300. Heard their stories. Learned about original timeline's slow decline. Understood why they chose to erase themselves.

Dr. Chen answered today. She sounded weaker than last time.

"We're starting the final transmission sequence," she said. "Should be ready in five days. Thought you'd want to know."

"I do. Thank you for telling me."

"I wanted to ask you something. The bootstrap timeline—does it avoid our mistakes? The climate cascade, the resource wars, all the things that killed us?"

"We're... we're navigating differently. Have challenges you didn't have—temporal paradox, weaponization risks. But yes. We learn from your failures. Try not to repeat them."

"Good. That makes this meaningful. That you learn. That our extinction teaches lessons."

"We're trying to honor the gift."

"You keep saying that. Gift. Like we gave you something valuable."

"You gave us existence. That's the most valuable gift possible."

"We gave you probability cloud. You're making it real by closing the loop. That's the hard part. We just pressed send."

"You erased yourselves. That's not 'just pressed send.'"

"Compared to living with that choice for 55 years until the loop closes? We have it easy. We die quickly. You carry our ghosts for decades."

I hadn't thought about it that way. They were right. They chose oblivion. We chose obligation. Both difficult, but different weights.

"I wish we could save you," I said. "Wish the bootstrap paradox let your timeline survive too."

"Can't have both. Quantum mechanics doesn't allow it. Either we exist and humanity ends in 2150, or we erase ourselves and humanity continues via bootstrap. We chose bootstrap. No regrets."

"Really? No regrets?"

She was quiet. Then: "One regret. I wish I could see it. The timeline we're creating. Wish I could know if eight billion people living is really worth 300 dying."

"It is. I promise it is."

"You're biased. You exist because we chose this. Of course you think it's worth it."

"Maybe. But I've seen the original timeline's decline. I've experienced it through quantum entanglement. If you'd continued, extinction was inevitable. This way, some version of humanity survives."

"Some version. Not us."

"Your quantum patterns. Your knowledge. Your choice. All embedded in the signal. You exist through the bootstrap timeline even if you don't experience it directly."

"Philosophy to make dying easier."

"Truth to make living easier. For us. Knowing we're built on something meaningful rather than random chance."

**July 3, 2030**

Dr. Park was distraught today.

"Two people killed themselves," she said. "Couldn't handle the waiting. The knowing that we're extinct in a week."

"I'm sorry."

"They were scheduled for monitoring the transmission. Now we have to reorganize. Make sure we have enough hands to manage the final sequence." Her voice cracked. "Is it worth it? Really? Two suicides because they couldn't wait to die anyway?"

"The bootstrap timeline wouldn't exist without their contribution. Without all 300 of you. Yes. It's worth it."

"But they'll never know. Dead before the transmission even sends."

"Their choice to be part of the 300 made the transmission possible. They're in the memorial. We'll remember them."

"Remembering doesn't bring them back."

"No. But it means they mattered. That their existence—however it ended—contributed to billions of other existences."

She was crying. "I don't want to die, Dr. Cross. I want to see the timeline we're creating. Want to know if it's beautiful. If it's worth erasing ourselves for."

"It is. I'll make sure it is. Will close the loop and create timeline so stable and good that your sacrifice is honored in every moment we exist."

"Promise?"

"I promise. The bootstrap timeline will be worthy of the 300. Will be worthy of you."

**July 9, 2030**

I couldn't establish connection today. Power must be failing in the bunker. The quantum entanglement degraded too much to maintain link.

This might be the last time I could reach them.

Tomorrow or the next day, they'd send the transmission. Embed the signal in Voyager. Create the bootstrap paradox.

And then they'd cease. Timeline erased. 300 people becoming probability wave that never quite collapsed.

I wanted to say goodbye properly. Wanted to thank them one more time. Wanted to promise I'd close the loop correctly.

But the connection wouldn't stabilize.

So I sent message through degraded link. Not sure if they received it. But I had to try.

*Dr. Chen. Dr. Park. All 300. Thank you for our existence. Thank you for choosing bootstrap over complete extinction. Thank you for believing we were worth creating. I'll close the loop. I'll make your sacrifice permanent. I'll honor the gift every day of the timeline you're giving us. You won't be forgotten. You'll be the foundation. 300 names holding up eight billion lives. Rest well. You succeeded. The future you're creating survives. —Elliot*

The connection collapsed. Quantum foam returning to random noise.

They were gone. Or would be soon. Sending final transmission. Erasing themselves. Creating us.

I came back to Oakland workshop gasping. Cassandra was there immediately.

"You were deep," she said. "Neural readings showed intense entanglement."

"I was talking to them. The 300. Over the past few weeks. Learning their stories. Promising to honor them."

"And now?"

"Now they're dying. Sending the final transmission. Becoming the ghosts we carry."

She held me while I processed. The weight of those conversations. The obligation of those promises. The knowledge that 300 people I'd spoken with were deliberately ceasing to exist so we could continue.

"We close the loop," I said. "We make their sacrifice permanent. We create timeline so good it justifies 300 extinctions."

"We will."

"We have to."

"We will."

300 voices across quantum foam.

300 goodbyes I couldn't say properly.

300 ghosts who chose us over themselves.

And now we carried them toward 1977.

Toward loop closure.

Toward making their gift permanent.

One conversation at a time.

One promise at a time.

One more reason the mission couldn't fail.
