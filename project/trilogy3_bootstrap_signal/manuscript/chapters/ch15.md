# Chapter 15: Agent Reyes Closes In

**Mountain View, California - SETI Institute**
**November 15, 2029 - 6:42 AM**

They came at dawn, because that's when people are slowest.

I was at my desk, pretending to work on a routine signal analysis while actually reviewing the Recursionists' probability models for the hundredth time. The first critical decision point. Today. This moment, or one very much like it.

Soren had sent me three messages in the past hour. Each one a variation of the same warning: *Stay ready. When they come, don't hesitate.*

When, not if.

The mathematics were clear. In every timeline iteration where I was arrested on November 15th, the loop collapsed within three months. Causality failure. Reality unwinding like a spool of film running backward.

So when the fire alarm started screaming, I knew it wasn't a drill.

I grabbed my bag—already packed with encrypted drives, research notes, the quantum probability models Cassandra had developed—and moved toward the east exit. Away from the main entrance where protocol would funnel everyone.

The hallway was chaos. Researchers streaming toward exits, confusion on their faces. Through the windows, I could see black SUVs blocking the parking lot. Not fire trucks. Wrong vehicles for a fire alarm.

Wrong everything.

A hand caught my shoulder, spinning me around.

She was compact, athletic, with eyes that cataloged everything in a single sweep. Professional suit, FBI credentials already out, a calm authority that suggested she'd done this before.

"Dr. Elliot Cross. I'm Agent Maya Reyes, Temporal Anomalies Division. I need you to come with me."

Temporal Anomalies Division. So it was real. Not just paranoid speculation by the Recursionists.

"Am I under arrest?" I kept my voice steady, casual. Just another confused employee caught in a fire drill.

"That depends on how cooperative you are. We need to discuss the Voyager signal and the unauthorized research you've been conducting." Her grip on my shoulder was iron. "We can do this easily, or we can do it officially. Your choice."

The word "choice" again. Following me like a ghost.

Down the hall, I saw two more agents clearing rooms. Professional, coordinated. They'd been planning this operation for a while. Probably since I first accessed the signal data.

"I'd like to call my lawyer," I said.

"Of course. After we've secured the facility and ensured there are no classified materials at risk." She smiled, but it didn't reach her eyes. "I'm sure you understand. National security takes precedence over constitutional niceties."

She started to steer me toward the main entrance. Toward the SUVs and whatever interrogation room they had prepared.

This was the moment. The first domino in a chain that led to timeline collapse.

I thought about the mathematics. The probability branches. The weight of eight billion lives balanced against the choice to resist arrest.

Then I thought about my father's domino game and decided I was done pretending I didn't know which one to knock down.

I drove my elbow back into Reyes' solar plexus.

She gasped, her grip loosening for just a second. I twisted free and ran.

"Suspect is fleeing! East corridor!" Her voice behind me, calm despite the assault. Professional. She'd been expecting resistance.

I crashed through the emergency exit, alarm shrieking louder. Outside, the morning was gray and cold. I could see the parking lot crawling with federal agents.

But I could also see the white van parked at the back entrance. Sarah in the driver's seat, engine already running.

The Recursionists, right on schedule. Following a script written by probability mathematics.

Gunshots. Not at me—warning shots into the air. Reyes and her team pouring out of the building. I ran harder, my lungs burning, my bag bouncing against my hip.

Twenty yards to the van. Fifteen.

"Dr. Cross, stop!" Reyes' voice carried across the parking lot. "You're making a mistake!"

Maybe. But it was my mistake to make.

Sarah threw the door open. I dove into the van, and we were moving before I'd even gotten the door closed. Tires screaming, acceleration pinning me to the seat.

Through the back window, I watched Reyes standing in the parking lot, her expression unreadable. Not angry. Not even surprised.

She'd known I would run. Had counted on it.

That thought followed me all the way to the safe house.

The Recursionists' backup facility was in San Jose, hidden in a industrial park that had seen better decades. Warehouses full of forgotten machinery and the ghosts of manufacturing jobs that had fled overseas.

Soren was waiting when we arrived.

"Welcome to the resistance," he said, like I'd just joined a revolution instead of fleeing federal custody. "You passed the first test."

"That wasn't a test. That was felony assault on a federal officer."

"It was a critical decision point. And you chose correctly." He gestured to a makeshift operations center—computers, comm equipment, a wall covered in timeline diagrams that looked like they'd been drawn by a particularly mathematical prophet. "Agent Reyes and her division have been preparing for temporal technology to surface. They want to control it. Weaponize it. Use future knowledge to cement current power structures."

"You don't know that."

"We've seen it happen. In the timeline echoes. In every iteration where the government secures the signal first, they turn it into an instrument of control. Surveillance technology informed by future developments. Weapons systems guided by knowledge of future conflicts." He pulled up footage on one of the monitors—news clips, government briefings, fragments of what might have been. "This timeline's only hope is for the loop to close before they can monopolize what you've discovered."

I sank into a chair, adrenaline finally fading, leaving exhaustion in its wake. "I just assaulted a federal agent. I'm a fugitive now."

"You're a variable choosing its own value," Soren corrected. "The system tried to constrain you. You refused. That's not crime. That's free will operating within deterministic constraints."

"Tell that to the judge."

"There won't be a judge. Not if we close the loop correctly. The timeline will stabilize, and all of this becomes historical necessity rather than criminal act. You'll be the person who ensured humanity's survival, not the suspect who fled federal custody."

Sarah came in with coffee, her expression sympathetic. "I know it's not much consolation, but you did the right thing. Reyes' division isn't interested in scientific progress. They want control."

I took the coffee, wrapping my hands around the warmth. My shoulder ached where Reyes had grabbed me. My ribs hurt from running. Every part of me wanted to believe this was temporary. A misunderstanding that would resolve itself.

But I'd seen the mathematics. This was the only path that led to timeline stability.

"What happens now?" I asked.

"Now we build the device," Soren said. "The signal contains blueprints. Dr. Chen has been analyzing them for years. With your expertise in signal decryption and Dr. Wright's quantum physics background, we can complete construction within three months."

"Cassandra." I stood up too fast, coffee sloshing. "She's at the lab. If Reyes knows about me—"

"She's being collected as we speak. Dr. Wright was always part of the equation. The Recursionists have been protecting her just as we've been preparing for you."

I wanted to argue. Wanted to rage against the presumption that they could just collect people like chess pieces. But Cassandra had seen the same models I had. She knew this moment was coming.

She'd chosen this path too, even if she'd done it months ago when she agreed to help me.

"I want to talk to her," I said. "Make sure she's okay."

"Of course." Soren gestured to a secure phone. "But keep it brief. Reyes will be tracking all communications. She's very good at her job."

I took the phone, dialed Cassandra's number. She answered on the first ring.

"Elliot. Tell me you're somewhere safe."

"Relatively. The Recursionists have a facility in San Jose. Sarah says you're being collected?"

"I'm with them now. Dr. Chen is driving, and she's explaining how my quantum consciousness theory was apparently correct in ways I didn't anticipate. It's flattering and terrifying." A pause. "You assaulted a federal agent."

"Critical decision point. I followed the math."

"I know. I ran the same calculations. But Elliot, we're fugitives now. There's no going back from this."

"There never was. Not from the moment I found the signal." I watched Soren and his people moving through the operations center, each one following their own predetermined role in the causality chain. "We're all just dominoes pretending we chose where to fall."

"That's not true. We could have chosen differently. Gone with Reyes. Let the government handle the temporal mechanics."

"And watched them weaponize future knowledge. Turn the bootstrap paradox into an instrument of control. The timeline models are clear, Cass. That path leads to extinction."

"I know." Her voice was soft. "I'm just... I'm scared. We're betting eight billion lives on mathematical models developed by a cult that worships causality."

"Not a cult. A congregation."

She laughed, and I heard the edge of hysteria in it. "You're defending them now?"

"I'm acknowledging they're right. The math is sound. The timeline mechanics are real. And yes, they're cultish and unsettling, but they've also been the only ones taking this seriously for eleven years." I lowered my voice. "I need you in this, Cass. You're my anchor. My connection to linear time. Without you, I'm just a consciousness fragmenting across probability states."

Silence on the other end. Long enough that I thought we'd been disconnected.

Then: "Okay. I'm in. But Elliot, when this is over—if we survive—we're having a very long conversation about how you dragged me into becoming a domestic terrorist in service of temporal mechanics."

"Deal. I'll even buy the coffee."

"Make it whiskey. I'm going to need it."

We hung up, and I felt something unknot in my chest. Whatever happened next, we'd face it together.

Soren appeared at my shoulder. "Agent Reyes will be analyzing your escape. Looking for patterns, for ways to predict your movements. She's been hunting temporal anomalies for years. She knows this is more than a fugitive situation."

"What do you know about her?"

"Enough to be cautious. Her division was formed after a classified quantum computing experiment went wrong. Temporal displacement of matter—or possibly personnel. The records are buried, but our sources suggest it wasn't just equipment that got displaced." He pulled up a dossier on one of the monitors. "She's hunting you because she understands what's at stake. And that makes her extremely dangerous."

I looked at Reyes' photo. Professional headshot, her expression neutral and unreadable. The face of someone who'd seen things that broke the normal categories of possible.

"She knew I would run," I said. "In the parking lot. She wasn't surprised."

"Because she's seen the models too. The government has its own probability analysts. They're trying to steer the timeline just like we are. The difference is they want control. We want closure."

"And Reyes? What does she want?"

Soren was quiet for a moment. "That's the interesting question. Her official mission is to secure you and the signal. But her psychological profile suggests a personal stake. Something happened to her involving temporal mechanics. Something that motivates her beyond duty."

I thought about the calm in her voice. The professional detachment. The way she'd said "constitutional niceties" like they were obstacles rather than principles.

A woman who'd been changed by temporal anomalies and now hunted them for a living.

"We'll encounter her again," I said. It wasn't a question.

"Inevitably. The timeline models show multiple intersections between your paths. Some of them resolve peacefully. Others..." He didn't finish the sentence.

Others ended in alleyways, with rain and bullets and the taste of copper.

"Then we need to be ready," I said. "For all the versions of how this might end."

"That's why you're the Closer," Soren said softly. "Because you understand that accepting determinism doesn't mean surrendering to it. It means walking the path with your eyes open."

I looked around the operations center, at the Recursionists preparing for a war against causality itself. At the timeline diagrams mapping futures both probable and impossible. At the weight of history pressing down on choices not yet made.

Somewhere out there, Reyes was mobilizing her team. Analyzing my psychology. Building a profile of how I would move, where I would hide, what I would do next.

And she would be right about most of it.

But not all of it.

Because the thing about bootstrap paradoxes is that they require novelty within repetition. The same song played with new variations. And if I was truly the variable the timeline needed, then I had to find the choices that hadn't been made before.

The dominoes my father never set up.

The path the mathematics predicted but hadn't yet constrained.

I pulled up the timeline models on the nearest screen and started looking for gaps. Spaces where probability clouds overlapped without collapsing into certainty.

Somewhere in those gaps was freedom.

I just had to be willing to leap into uncertainty.

And hope the loop caught me before I hit the ground.
