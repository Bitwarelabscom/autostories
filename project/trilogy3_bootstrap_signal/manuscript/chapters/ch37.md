# Chapter 37: Reyes' Trauma Revealed

**Location Unknown - Federal Facility**
**August 19, 2030 - 2:33 PM**

I woke up in a cell that pretended to be a consultation room.

The restraints were subtle—reinforced chair, locked door, probably armed guards outside. But they'd left me unshackled, provided water, even left my clothes on. Professional courtesy for someone they wanted to interrogate rather than torture.

Agent Reyes sat across from me, looking exactly as she had seven months ago at SETI. Same professional suit. Same observant eyes. Same calm authority that suggested she'd won before the game even started.

"Dr. Cross. Good afternoon. You've been unconscious for six hours."

My head throbbed. "Tranquilizer?"

"We had to subdue you during extraction. You and Dr. Wright were making things unnecessarily difficult." She slid a tablet across the table. "Your colleagues are fine. We have Dr. Wright in a similar accommodation. Dr. Chen and the Recursionists scattered. We'll find them eventually."

I looked at the tablet. Surveillance photos of Cassandra in another room. She looked angry but unharmed. They'd caught us during a supply run. Stupid mistake. We'd gotten complacent, started believing our own probability models.

The timeline had course-corrected.

"What do you want?" I asked.

"The same thing I wanted seven months ago. To prevent temporal technology from destroying causality." Reyes pulled up files on her own tablet. "You've been busy, Dr. Cross. Built a functional quantum temporal interface. Accessed multiple timeline iterations. Even managed to weaponize future knowledge enough to stay ahead of federal pursuit. I'm impressed."

"You're hunting the wrong people."

"Am I? You're a fugitive who assaulted a federal officer, evaded custody, and built a device capable of violating causality itself. That seems like exactly the right person to hunt."

"You don't understand what we're trying to do."

"Then enlighten me." She leaned back, genuinely interested. "Make me understand why building a time machine as a fugitive is somehow protecting humanity rather than threatening it."

I studied her. Seven months of running, I'd built up an image of Reyes as antagonist. Government enforcer trying to control what shouldn't be controlled. But looking at her now, I saw something else. Exhaustion. The kind that came from hunting something you knew was dangerous but didn't fully understand.

And something else. Pain. Old trauma wearing professional competence like armor.

"You've experienced temporal displacement," I said carefully. "Personal experience, not just theoretical. That's why they put you in charge of Temporal Anomalies Division."

Her expression didn't change, but I saw the flicker. Hit a nerve.

"That's classified."

"A lot of things are classified. Doesn't make them less real." I leaned forward as much as the chair allowed. "Something happened to you involving temporal mechanics. Something that makes you hunt this technology because you know firsthand what it can do."

Silence. She was deciding how much to reveal. Whether truth would help her interrogation or undermine it.

Finally: "March 14th, 2024. Classified quantum computing experiment at Lawrence Livermore. We were testing probability field manipulation. My partner and I were running security for the physicists." She paused, and I watched her gather the words like they were sharp. "Something went wrong. The field destabilized. And when it collapsed, my partner was gone."

"Dead?"

"Worse. Erased. Timeline displacement. He was removed from causality itself. The lab was suddenly configured for one security officer instead of two. Personnel files showed I'd always worked alone. Everyone's memories adjusted except mine." Her voice was controlled, clinical. "I'm the only person who remembers Marcus ever existed."

Marcus. I thought about the weight of carrying someone's entire existence in your memory alone. Being the only witness that they were real.

"The government told you it was psychotic break," I said. "Delusional disorder. Tried to get you to believe your partner never existed."

"Yes. But I knew better. I had physical evidence they couldn't explain. A photo that showed two security officers when records only listed one. A scar on my hand from an incident that didn't happen because Marcus wasn't there to prevent it." She showed me her left hand. Clean scar across the palm. "That's how I know temporal displacement is real. I carry proof in my skin."

"So you started hunting temporal anomalies. Looking for a way to understand what happened. Maybe find a way to bring him back."

"To prove he existed. That I'm not insane." She met my eyes. "And to make sure no one else experiences what I did. The government wants to weaponize temporal technology. I've been trying to contain it. Keep it controlled. Make sure the experiments that erased Marcus don't become standard practice."

I understood her now. She wasn't enemy. She was someone traumatized by temporal mechanics trying to prevent others from suffering the same way. Her methods were wrong, but her motivation came from the right place.

"I can help you," I said.

"By surrendering the device specifications? Letting us study your work under proper oversight?"

"By showing you that Marcus still exists. That he wasn't erased—just displaced. And that the device I built can prove it."

She went very still. "Explain."

"Timeline displacement doesn't erase people. It shifts them to different probability branches. Marcus wasn't deleted from existence. He was moved to an alternate timeline—one where the quantum experiment took a different path. He's still real. You're just in a timeline where he isn't present."

"That's just another way of saying he doesn't exist here."

"No. It means he exists somewhere else. And my device can show you." I watched her process this. "Agent Reyes, I've been using quantum entanglement to observe across timeline iterations for months. I've seen hundreds of probability branches. If Marcus was displaced to an alternate timeline, I can find him. Prove to you that your memories are real."

"Why would you do that?"

"Because you're hunting us for the wrong reasons. You think we're threatening causality. But we're trying to close a bootstrap paradox that's the only thing keeping humanity alive. If you understood what we're actually doing—if you saw the original timeline, the failed loops, the weaponization timelines—you'd realize we're on the same side."

She was quiet for a long time. I could see the war in her expression. Professional duty versus personal desperation. The hope that someone might finally validate her trauma versus the suspicion that I was manipulating her.

"The device is in our custody," she said finally. "Secured at this facility. If I let you access it, you could use it to contact your Recursionist allies. Arrange escape. I'd be compromising the entire operation."

"Or you'd be learning the truth. About Marcus. About the signal. About why trying to control temporal technology is the one thing guaranteed to destroy everything." I held her gaze. "I've seen the timeline where you succeed. Where you capture me, secure the device, hand everything over to your superiors. They weaponize it. Nuclear war 2034. Eight billion dead. I lived through that timeline's ending, Reyes. Felt it collapse. You're trying to prevent the very thing you're causing."

"You can't know that."

"I can. Because I've been there. The device let me access Branch 47—the weaponization timeline. I know exactly how it ends when governments control temporal mechanics. And it ends with everyone dead."

She stood up, pacing the small room. I watched her struggle with the impossible choice. Everything she'd built her career on said she was right. But everything she'd experienced told her I might be telling the truth.

"If I let you use the device," she said slowly, "and you're lying—if this is an escape attempt or a way to destroy evidence—I'll spend the rest of my career in prison for aiding a fugitive."

"If you don't let me prove this, you'll spend the rest of your life not knowing if Marcus was real. Wondering if you're insane. And you'll enable the exact timeline that gets everyone killed."

"That's a lot of pressure to put on one decision."

"Welcome to my life for the past eight months."

She laughed. Single bark of bitter humor. "You know what the worst part is? I believe you. I've read your psychological profile. You're not a liar. You're a paranoid obsessive who follows mathematics even when they lead somewhere uncomfortable. If you say you've seen the weaponization timeline, I believe that you believe it."

"So let me prove it. Show you Marcus. Show you the timeline branches. Let you see what I've seen. Then make an informed decision about whether to keep hunting me or help me close the loop."

She was silent for so long I thought she'd decided against it.

Then: "One hour. You get one hour with the device under full supervision. If you can prove Marcus exists in an alternate timeline, I'll listen to your case. If you can't—or if you try anything—we proceed with standard interrogation protocols and prosecution. Agreed?"

"Agreed."

She knocked on the door. Guards opened it, and she gave instructions. "Bring Dr. Cross to Lab 3. Full security detail. And get Dr. Wright—she'll need to monitor the quantum readings."

Twenty minutes later, I was seated at my own device, relocated to a federal laboratory and surrounded by armed guards. Cassandra was there too, brought in under escort. She met my eyes, and I saw the question: *What the hell are you doing?*

I gave her the slightest nod. *Trust me.*

Reyes stood behind me. "Prove it. Show me Marcus."

I activated the device, feeling the familiar quantum entanglement spread through my consciousness. The probability fields opened up like flowers, revealing timeline branches scattered across possibility space.

I focused on March 14th, 2024. The day of the quantum computing experiment. The divergence point where Marcus was displaced.

The timelines split.

In one branch—our branch—the experiment destabilized. Marcus was displaced. Timeline adjusted to accommodate his absence. Reyes remembered him, but no one else did.

But in the other branch...

"There," I said, pulling the data onto the lab monitors. "Branch 73. The timeline where the experiment was shut down three seconds earlier. Marcus wasn't caught in the displacement field. He's still there."

The monitors showed quantum probability data. But through the device's consciousness interface, I could see more. Could experience that timeline's reality.

And Marcus was in it. Security officer, age 38, still working with Reyes in that timeline's version of Temporal Anomalies Division. Living his life. Real and solid and existing.

Reyes stared at the data, her hands trembling. "That's... that could be fabricated. Quantum projections based on my memories."

"It's not. Look at the divergence markers. The quantum signature is consistent with timeline displacement, not fabrication. And here—" I pulled up more data. "He has a daughter. Born in 2026 in that timeline. Named Isabel. Two years old. You've never mentioned a daughter because you didn't know about her. She only exists in the timeline where Marcus wasn't displaced."

Reyes made a sound. Something between gasp and sob. "How..."

"Because timelines continue after displacement. People don't freeze. They live. Marcus met someone, had a child, kept working. He's real, Agent Reyes. Your memories aren't delusion. He's just in a different probability branch."

She was crying now. Professional facade cracking as eight years of trauma and doubt and isolation finally met proof. "Can I see him? Talk to him?"

"The device doesn't allow direct communication across intact timelines. Only observation. But yes. You can see him."

I adjusted the quantum entanglement, pulling up direct observational feed from Branch 73. And there he was. Marcus Reyes, security officer, currently at work, reviewing case files, living his normal life in a timeline where the experiment hadn't gone wrong.

Agent Reyes—Maya, I realized, she had a first name—watched her partner exist. Tears streaming down her face but expression fixed with desperate attention. Memorizing every detail of a man only she remembered.

"He's real," she whispered. "I'm not insane. He's real."

"You were never insane. You were just the only person observing the right probability branch."

She watched for a long time. I let her. The guards shifted uncomfortably, unsure how to handle their commanding officer breaking down. Cassandra moved closer to me, her hand finding mine. Anchoring me while I kept the entanglement stable.

Finally, Reyes pulled herself together. Wiped her eyes. Became professional again—but different now. Carrying proof instead of doubt.

"Show me the weaponization timeline," she said. "The one where I succeed. I need to see it."

I showed her Branch 47. Walked her through every step. Her successful capture. My cooperation. The government building Project Causality Shield. Multiple nations developing competing technology. Timeline manipulation creating unsustainable temporal pressure.

And finally, March 15th, 2034. Nuclear exchange. Eight billion dead.

She watched it all. Took it in with the same focused attention she'd given Marcus. Seeing her success lead to extinction.

When it was done, she was pale. "That happens if I do my job correctly."

"That happens if anyone tries to control temporal mechanics instead of working with them. The timeline has momentum. Forcing specific outcomes creates pressure that builds until something breaks. And what breaks is usually everything."

"Then what do we do?"

"We let the loop close. Let me go back to 1977 and embed the signal that creates the bootstrap paradox. Stabilize the timeline so it stops trying to collapse. Give humanity the existence that three hundred people died to create for us."

"Three hundred people?"

I showed her the original timeline. The dying research facility. Dr. Chen's quantum transmission. The choice to erase themselves for the sake of an alternate humanity.

By the time I finished, Reyes was sitting down, looking like she'd been hit.

"We only exist because of them," she said quietly. "The bootstrap timeline is a gift."

"Yes. And my job is to close the loop correctly so their sacrifice matters. But I can't do that if I'm in federal custody. Can't do it if the government seizes the device and tries to weaponize it. Can't do it if you keep hunting me for doing the only thing that prevents extinction."

She was quiet for a long time. Processing everything. Reconstructing her worldview around new information.

"What do you need from me?" she asked finally.

"Let us go. Cassandra and I. Give us time to perfect the device and prepare for the temporal jump. And keep your superiors from finding us. Make them think you're still hunting us while actually giving us space to close the loop."

"You're asking me to commit treason."

"I'm asking you to save humanity. And to honor Marcus—both the one you lost and the one who's still living in Branch 73. Give his existence meaning by making sure this timeline survives."

She looked at the monitors, still showing probability branches and quantum data. Evidence that her trauma was real. That timelines were real. That everything I'd told her was verifiable mathematics rather than delusion.

"If I do this," she said, "and you're wrong—if closing the loop causes timeline collapse instead of preventing it—I'll have enabled human extinction."

"If you don't do this, Branch 47 becomes inevitable. I've seen the probability trees. Every timeline where I'm in federal custody leads to weaponization. Every one leads to 2034. The only branches that survive are ones where I'm free to close the loop."

"Determinism as survival strategy."

"Determinism as gift from the dead. We have to honor it by completing it."

She stood, made her decision. "I'm going to report that you attempted escape during device demonstration. That you and Dr. Wright overpowered guards and fled. That we lost you in the confusion." She looked at the guards, who were staring at her in shock. "And you're all going to corroborate that story, because if you don't, I'll have you charged with compromising national security by enabling the exact timeline that ends in nuclear war. Understood?"

The guards nodded. Sometimes authority only needed confidence.

Reyes turned back to me. "You have four months until your temporal window. I can buy you that much time. But Dr. Cross, if you fail—if the loop doesn't close—there won't be anyone left to hold accountable. We'll all just cease to have existed."

"I know."

"Then don't fail."

She unlocked my restraints herself. Escorted us to a side exit. Gave us an unmarked car with enough fuel to reach the Oakland facility.

Before we left, she pulled me aside.

"Thank you," she said quietly. "For showing me Marcus. For proving I'm not insane."

"Thank you for listening. For being willing to change your mind when the evidence changed."

"That's just good science." She almost smiled. "Now go close your loop. And Dr. Cross? When you embed the signal in 1977, include something about Marcus. Let future iterations know that some people got displaced but were still real. That memory can preserve existence even when timeline can't."

"I will."

We drove away from the federal facility, Cassandra beside me, freedom feeling fragile and temporary.

"You just converted our primary hunter into an ally," she said after a while.

"I just showed her the truth. She converted herself."

"By showing her that her trauma was real."

"By proving that temporal mechanics isn't something to control but something to navigate carefully. That the only way to survive it is to work with causality instead of against it."

"And now she's risking everything to help us."

"Because she understands the stakes. She's seen what happens when governments try to weaponize time. She's carrying proof in her skin."

Cassandra was quiet as we drove. Then: "Four months. We have four months to perfect the device and prepare for the biggest leap in human history."

"And to add hope to the signal. And to honor 300 dead people. And to prove that Reyes made the right choice trusting us."

"No pressure."

"All the pressure. But we've handled worse."

"Have we?"

"We survived this long. Made it through 847 iterations' worth of critical decisions. Turned our primary antagonist into an ally. I'd say we're doing better than most failed timelines."

"Setting a low bar."

"It's the only bar we have."

We drove toward Oakland, toward the Recursionists, toward the four months of preparation before the final leap.

Reyes had bought us time.

Now we had to make it count.

Behind us, federal agents were reporting an escape. Reyes was lying to her superiors, committing career suicide to protect a future she'd never see.

All because I'd shown her that her pain was real.

That timelines were real.

That Marcus was real, somewhere, in a probability branch she could never touch but could finally believe in.

Sometimes proof was the kindest gift you could give.

And sometimes the kindest gift required breaking every rule.

We'd broken enough already.

What was one more in service of saving everything?
