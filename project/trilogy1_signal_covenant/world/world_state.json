  "series_title": "The Signal Covenant Trilogy",
  "genre": "Hard Science Fiction / Political Thriller",
  "setting": {
    "time_period": "2034-2037 (Near future)",
    "primary_location": "Global - focusing on Atacama Desert Observatory (Chile), Washington D.C., Geneva (UN Headquarters), and various underground research facilities",
    "atmosphere": "Tense, paranoid, intellectually rigorous. The world teeters between hope and fear as humanity confronts proof of alien intelligence.",
    "technology_level": "Near-future realistic - quantum computing emerging, AI assistants common, climate crisis managed but not solved, private space industry mature"
  },
  "rules": {
    "physics": {
      "ftl_travel": "Impossible - Einstein's speed limit holds",
      "communication": "Light-speed limited - Voyager 2 signals take hours to reach Earth from outer solar system",
      "voyager_modifications": "Probe's systems have been quantum-altered by alien technology - operating beyond original specifications but following observable physics"
    },
    "technology_constraints": {
      "ai_limitation": "No true AGI exists - advanced narrow AI only",
      "space_capability": "Humans have lunar base, Mars missions planned, but no interstellar capability",
      "communication_tech": "Radio telescopes can detect Voyager's signals, quantum decryption exists but is experimental"
    },
    "social_structures": {
      "global_politics": "Fragmented - UN weakened, regional blocs (NAU, EU, Asian Coalition, African Union) compete for influence",
      "science_authority": "Private observatories compete with government agencies - scientific discovery is politicized",
      "public_awareness": "Initially low, escalates rapidly - social media drives both unity movements and conspiracy theories",
      "power_dynamics": "First contact is weaponized - whoever controls alien knowledge controls the future"
    },
    "alien_contact_rules": {
      "test_nature": "Aliens are evaluating humanity's intelligence AND social cohesion through mathematical challenges embedded in signals",
      "no_direct_contact": "Aliens never appear directly - only through Voyager 2 as intermediary",
      "choice_mechanism": "Humanity must achieve consensus on response - divided civilizations are rejected",
      "timeline_pressure": "18-month countdown from discovery to Voyager's Earth arrival - creates urgency"
    }
  },
  "themes": [
    "Unity vs Division - Can humanity overcome tribalism when faced with cosmic significance?",
    "Knowledge as Power - Who has the right to control first contact?",
    "The Loneliness of Intelligence - What if we're being tested and fail?"
  ],
  "tone": "Cerebral and tense. Emphasizes intellectual puzzle-solving and political maneuvering over action. Characters debate philosophy, ethics, science. Dialogue-heavy. Atmosphere of creeping paranoia mixed with wonder."
