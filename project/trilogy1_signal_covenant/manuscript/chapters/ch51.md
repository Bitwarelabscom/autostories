# Chapter 51: The Final Push

Seven days before Voyager's arrival, Marcus stood before a global media conference and announced the discovery that changed everything.

"Independent analysis by seventeen research institutions worldwide has confirmed a third option in the Assembled's choice framework. The stated threshold of eighty-five percent represents full partnership. But there exists a second threshold at seventy-five percent that triggers provisional contact—a trial period where the Assembled evaluate humanity's continued growth potential."

The room erupted. Questions shouted simultaneously, cameras flashing, reporters demanding clarification.

"How long have you known?" "Why announce now?" "Is this desperation because you're failing the test?"

Marcus waited for quiet. "We've suspected tertiary mathematical structures for weeks. We only confirmed them forty-eight hours ago through rigorous independent verification. We're announcing now because humanity deserves to know the full scope of choices available."

"You're currently at sixty-four percent," a reporter said. "Even seventy-five is eleven points away with one week left. Aren't you just moving the goalpost because you can't reach the original target?"

"We didn't move the goalpost. The Assembled embedded two thresholds in their mathematics from the beginning. We just discovered the second one. Whether we can reach seventy-five percent in the time remaining is uncertain. But having a clearer understanding of the choice framework is better than operating with incomplete information."

The announcement hit the global referendum like an earthquake.

Within six hours, forty million people who'd been abstaining participated. Not all voting yes—the third option didn't eliminate legitimate concerns about contact. But participating because the choice felt more nuanced than binary yes/no.

Within twenty-four hours:

Total participants: 1.37 billion
Yes votes: 896 million (65.4%)
No votes: 474 million (34.6%)

They'd gained 1.1 percentage points in a single day. The discovery of the third option was shifting the conversation from "all or nothing" to "degrees of engagement." People who'd been paralyzed by the stakes were finding middle ground.

"Nine point six percentage points to go," Dr. Rashid reported. "Six days remaining. We need 1.6 points per day to reach seventy-five percent."

"Is that achievable?" Sofia asked.

"Yesterday we gained 1.1 in one day just from the announcement. If momentum holds..."

But momentum didn't hold. The initial surge tapered off. By day two after the announcement, they'd gained only 0.4 percentage points. By day three, 0.3.

Total participants: 1.43 billion
Yes votes: 967 million (67.6%)
No votes: 463 million (32.4%)

Four days until Voyager arrived. Seven point four percentage points to go.

"We're slowing down," Yuki said, analyzing participation trends. "The announcement surge is over. We're back to incremental growth. At current rates, we reach seventy-two percent by deadline. Close, but short."

Marcus pulled up demographic analysis. They'd saturated accessible populations—urban, connected, educated demographics were participating at near-maximum rates. The remaining non-participants were harder to reach: remote populations, people actively choosing not to engage, populations systematically excluded from global networks.

"We need one more surge," Sofia said. "Something that mobilizes the last holdouts. But what? We've tried everything—grassroots organizing, media campaigns, direct outreach."

"We've tried external motivation," Dr. Rashid said. "Maybe we need internal motivation. Make it personal."

"How?" Marcus asked.

"Stories. Not data, not arguments. Personal stories from people who've chosen. Why it matters to them individually. Make it less about humanity's collective future and more about individual hopes and fears."

It was worth trying.

They launched a campaign: #WhyIChose. People sharing in their own words why they voted yes or no, what hopes or fears drove them, what they wanted for their children or communities.

The stories flooded in. A farmer in Kenya voting yes because climate technology might save his land. A teacher in Japan voting no because she feared losing cultural identity. A doctor in Brazil voting yes hoping for medical advances. An Indigenous elder in Canada voting no to preserve sovereignty.

The campaign worked—not by changing minds, but by making the choice feel real and personal instead of abstract and global.

Three days before arrival:

Total participants: 1.51 billion
Yes votes: 1.04 billion (68.9%)
No votes: 470 million (31.1%)

Six point one percentage points to go. Three days left.

They were so close. But close wasn't enough. The mathematics didn't care about effort or progress. Either they reached seventy-five percent or they didn't.

"We need two percentage points per day for three days," Yuki said. "That's... that's going to be really hard."

Marcus looked at the numbers, at the stories still flooding in, at the billion people who'd chosen and the billions more who still could.

"Then we work really hard," he said.

His phone chimed. Message from an unknown number: *Verification complete. I'm ready to announce. Tomorrow, 10 AM Geneva time. Full proof, complete explanation. Make sure the world is watching. - ET*

Thorne. Finally ready to make the third option official, with her full resources behind the proof.

Tomorrow would be Chapter 52. Thorne's Redemption.

And then three days to mobilize six percentage points.

It should have been impossible.

But they'd come this far through supposedly impossible challenges.

Maybe impossible just meant it hadn't been done yet.

Three days.

Six points.

Everything.
