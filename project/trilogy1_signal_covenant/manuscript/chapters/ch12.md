# Chapter 12: The Industrialist

Dr. Evelyn Thorne arrived at the Atacama Observatory in a helicopter that bore no corporate logos, accompanied by a single assistant and a proposal that Marcus recognized immediately as both generous and dangerous.

"Dr. Reid, thank you for seeing me on such short notice." Thorne offered her hand—firm grip, expensive manicure, the practiced confidence of someone accustomed to being the most powerful person in any room. She wore a tailored business suit that probably cost more than Marcus's monthly salary, but her eyes carried an intensity he recognized from his graduate school days. The look of someone who'd once cared about pure knowledge and hadn't entirely forgotten what that felt like.

"Dr. Thorne. Your message said you wanted to discuss Voyager 2." Marcus had debated refusing the meeting, but curiosity had won. Evelyn Thorne didn't make personal visits to obscure Chilean observatories without significant motivation.

"Please, call me Evelyn. We're both scientists, after all." She settled into a chair in the conference room, her assistant discreetly positioning himself in the corner. "Though I suppose I'm more accurately described as a former scientist these days. CEO of Prometheus Space Industries, corporate strategist, someone who sold her soul for funding and influence. But we can't all maintain our idealism, can we?"

The self-awareness was disarming. Marcus had expected corporate platitudes, not sardonic honesty about her career trajectory.

"What does Prometheus want with our Voyager research?" Sofia asked, joining the meeting with barely concealed suspicion.

"The same thing every corporation wants—competitive advantage, market dominance, shareholder value." Thorne pulled up a tablet and shared a presentation to their screens. "But unlike most corporations, I'm willing to be transparent about my methods. I've been monitoring your work for six weeks. Encrypted communications, off-the-books supercomputing time, recruitment of international mathematicians—you're building a team to decode alien signals without institutional backing. That's either brilliantly audacious or catastrophically reckless."

"How do you know about our work?" Marcus demanded.

"Because I pay very good analysts to track developments in space science. When Dr. Yuki Tanaka—my former doctoral student—starts working on cryptographic problems related to Voyager 2, I pay attention. When she coordinates with twelve international mathematicians and a Chilean radio astronomer, I investigate." Thorne's smile was sharp. "You're planning to publish via ArXiv in..." she checked her tablet, "sixty-eight hours. Open-access disclosure of first contact evidence. I assume you expect the global scientific community to rally around collaborative decoding efforts."

"You're tracking our publication timeline?" Sofia's voice was ice.

"I'm tracking everything. It's what I do." Thorne set down her tablet. "Which brings me to my proposition. Prometheus Industries has resources you need—supercomputing power, quantum decryption algorithms, communications infrastructure that doesn't rely on easily monitored government networks. I'm offering to provide those resources in exchange for partnership."

"Partnership meaning you get access to the alien knowledge," Marcus said.

"Partnership meaning we all get access to the alien knowledge, but Prometheus gets first commercial applications." Thorne was nothing if not direct. "The mathematical proofs you've decoded have immediate technological implications. Advanced encryption systems, new materials science frameworks, computational approaches that could revolutionize everything from drug discovery to climate modeling. I want Prometheus to be the company that commercializes those applications. In exchange, I provide the resources that make decoding possible before Voyager arrives."

Sofia leaned forward. "You want to monetize first contact."

"I want to ensure humanity doesn't waste the opportunity." Thorne's voice carried an edge. "Look, I'll be blunt. If you publish via ArXiv without institutional backing, governments will move immediately to classify the information. Your seventy-two-hour head start will evaporate. The NAU, the European Union, the Asian Coalition—they'll all claim jurisdiction over alien knowledge as a matter of national security. Your beautiful vision of global scientific collaboration will die in bureaucratic containment protocols."

"Kessler promised—" Marcus started.

"Director Kessler is one mid-level intelligence official fighting a battle against his entire institutional hierarchy. He can delay containment, but he can't prevent it. Not when you're about to publicly disclose evidence that threatens every government's strategic position." Thorne pulled up geopolitical analysis charts. "The moment you publish, the space race becomes a first contact race. Every major power will want exclusive access to alien technology. They'll fight over the signal, over interpretation rights, over who gets to respond to Voyager when it arrives."

"So we should just give Prometheus exclusive access instead?" Sofia asked incredulously.

"You should partner with the one entity that has the resources to maintain independence from government control and the infrastructure to support global collaboration." Thorne highlighted sections of her presentation. "Prometheus has private satellites, encrypted global communication networks, supercomputing facilities in seven countries, and enough legal resources to fight governmental confiscation attempts in multiple jurisdictions simultaneously. We can protect your research where governments can only suppress it."

Marcus studied Thorne's presentation. The resources were real—he recognized specifications for quantum computing arrays that made the Chilean supercomputer look like a calculator. Private satellite networks that could coordinate global research teams without government monitoring. Legal frameworks that could shield scientific work from classification.

It was tempting. It was also exactly the kind of corporate control that would betray everything they were trying to achieve.

"What happened to you?" The question came from Yuki, who'd been listening from the doorway. "You were my doctoral advisor. You taught me that pure knowledge mattered more than applications. You said science was about understanding reality, not exploiting it for profit. Now you're here offering to commercialize alien mathematics before we even understand what it means."

Thorne's expression flickered—something almost like pain crossing her features before the corporate mask reasserted itself. "What happened, Yuki, is that I tried to do pure research in a world that only funds applied research. I published beautiful work that won awards and got me exactly zero grant money. I watched brilliant colleagues leave academia because they couldn't afford to stay. I spent a decade writing funding proposals that were rejected because my work wasn't 'commercially viable.'" She stood and walked to the window. "So I made a choice. I founded Prometheus, used my scientific credibility to attract investors, and built a company that could fund the research I cared about. Except somewhere along the way, the funding became more important than the research. The company became more important than the science. And now I'm a CEO who happens to have a PhD instead of a scientist who happens to run a company."

The room was quiet. Marcus heard genuine regret in Thorne's voice—the kind that came from small compromises that accumulated into complete transformation.

"But you still care about the science," Yuki said quietly. "Or you wouldn't be here. You'd send lawyers and business development representatives. You came personally because part of you still wants to be part of discovery instead of just profiting from it."

Thorne turned from the window. "Of course I still care. I've spent twenty years building Prometheus into a space industry leader, and the entire time I've been hoping for exactly this kind of breakthrough. First contact. Alien knowledge. A chance to be part of something that matters beyond quarterly earnings and shareholder value." She looked at Yuki. "You think I enjoy being the villain in this story? The corporate sellout trying to monetize first contact? I hate it. But I'm also pragmatic enough to know that idealism without resources accomplishes nothing."

"Resources without ethics accomplish worse than nothing," Sofia countered. "They enable those with power to exploit everyone else."

"Which is why I'm proposing partnership, not acquisition." Thorne pulled up a different document—actual contract language, surprisingly equitable terms. "Prometheus provides infrastructure and protection. You maintain full scientific control. All discoveries are published open-access with appropriate delay for safety review. Commercial applications are shared with humanity under reasonable licensing. I make money, you make history, and we both prevent governments from weaponizing first contact. Everyone benefits."

Marcus scanned the contract terms. They were fairer than he'd expected—genuine partnership rather than corporate takeover. But the fundamental problem remained: corporate involvement meant corporate priorities, no matter how well-intentioned the initial agreement.

"Why should we trust you?" he asked.

"Because unlike governments, I actually want the alien knowledge to be used. Governments will classify and suppress because they fear losing strategic advantage. Corporations want to commercialize because we profit from application and dissemination. Our incentives align with global access, not containment." Thorne sat down again. "I know I'm not the ally you wanted. You wanted pure scientific collaboration, global institutions coming together in the spirit of discovery. But that's not the world we live in. In the real world, power structures compete for control, and if you don't ally with one of them, you'll be crushed by others."

Sofia and Marcus exchanged glances. Yuki looked torn—loyalty to her former mentor warring with suspicion of corporate motives. Rashid had joined the meeting at some point and stood in the corner, looking thoughtful.

"Evelyn raises valid points," Rashid said carefully. "Institutional suppression is a real threat. We need resources we currently lack. The question is whether corporate partnership is better or worse than governmental control."

"False dichotomy," Sofia said. "We can publish openly and invite global collaboration without pledging loyalty to any power structure. That's the entire point of ArXiv publication—bypassing gatekeepers entirely."

"Which works beautifully until you're detained for national security violations and your computers are confiscated," Thorne said. "You need protection, and protection requires power. I'm offering to be your power shield."

"In exchange for commercial rights to alien mathematics," Marcus said.

"In exchange for partnership that benefits both of us. You get resources and protection. I get commercial applications. Humanity gets access to alien knowledge faster than if governments control the distribution. It's a pragmatic solution to a complex problem."

Marcus thought about his dissertation, about how institutional gatekeeping had defined his career. About the choice between idealistic purity and pragmatic effectiveness. About whether compromise was wisdom or betrayal.

"We need to discuss this internally," he said. "Your proposal is serious, and we owe it serious consideration. But we're not making a decision today."

Thorne nodded. "Fair enough. I'll be staying in Santiago for the next seventy-two hours. You can reach me anytime." She stood to leave, then paused. "One more thing. You're planning to disclose four mathematical proofs as evidence of alien intelligence. I'd recommend leading with the Riemann Hypothesis proof. It's the most famous unsolved problem—everyone from mathematicians to general public will recognize the significance. Frame it as 'aliens solved a 163-year-old problem using methods we're just learning to understand.' That's a compelling narrative that inspires curiosity rather than fear."

"You're giving us publication advice?" Sofia asked.

"I'm giving you strategic communication advice. I've spent twenty years managing how scientific discoveries are presented to maximize positive reception. First contact is too important to fumble because of bad framing." Thorne handed Marcus a card. "Call me when you've decided. And Dr. Reid? Don't let idealism prevent you from accepting help. The aliens didn't send a message requiring global resources to decode and then expect you to solve it with limited observatory equipment and good intentions. They're teaching us that we need to work together, but they never specified that collaboration had to exclude corporate resources."

She left with her assistant, the helicopter departing with the same efficiency that had marked her arrival.

The team sat in silence for a long moment.

"I don't trust her," Sofia said finally. "Everything she said about protecting us and enabling collaboration—that's what every powerful entity says before exploiting the people they claim to help."

"She's not wrong about the government threat," Rashid pointed out. "Kessler can't protect us indefinitely. The moment we publish, multiple nations will move to classify and control."

"And Prometheus is better?" Sofia challenged. "Letting a corporation monetize first contact? That's the solution?"

Yuki was quiet, staring at the door Thorne had left through. "She meant what she said about missing pure science. I saw it in her eyes—the same look she had when I was her student and we'd solve a particularly elegant proof together. She used to stay up all night working on problems just because they were beautiful. Not for funding, not for applications. Just for the joy of understanding."

"What happened to that person?" Marcus asked.

"The world happened. Academic funding dried up. Universities demanded commercial applications. Peer review became more about political positioning than scientific merit. She couldn't do the work she loved through institutional channels, so she built her own infrastructure. Except the infrastructure became the point, and the science became secondary." Yuki looked at her former colleagues. "I don't think she's lying about wanting to be part of first contact. I think she genuinely wants to contribute to something meaningful again. But she's been thinking like a CEO for so long that she doesn't know how to think like a scientist anymore."

Marcus pulled up Thorne's contract proposal, reading through the specific terms. "If we do this—and I'm not saying we should—we'd need to modify these terms significantly. Full scientific autonomy, absolute transparency about all findings, immediate open publication of all discoveries, and Prometheus gets only commercial application rights, not ownership or control of knowledge."

"You're actually considering this," Sofia said.

"I'm considering that we have sixty-eight hours until publication, that government containment is likely within seventy-two hours after that, and that we need resources we don't currently have if we're going to complete the decoding before Voyager arrives. Thorne is offering those resources. Whether we accept depends on whether we can do so without compromising our principles."

"Principles are easy when they don't cost anything," Rashid said quietly. "The test is whether we maintain them when they're expensive."

Sofia was quiet, visibly wrestling with the decision. "If we partner with Prometheus, we're acknowledging that pure scientific collaboration is insufficient. That we need corporate power to enable the work we want to do. That's not the message we want to send about first contact."

"Maybe it's the message we need to send," Yuki said. "That humanity is complicated, that we use the resources we have available even when they're not ideal, that perfect collaboration is less achievable than pragmatic partnership. The aliens have been watching us for centuries—they know we're not a unified species. Maybe the test is whether we can work together despite our divisions, not whether we've magically transcended them."

Marcus thought about the mathematical proofs embedded in Voyager's signal, about lessons in thinking beyond human dimensions, about aliens who were teaching humanity to see in ways we'd never imagined.

Maybe they were also teaching us to work with the world as it was, not as we wished it to be.

"We table the decision for now," he said. "Focus on finalizing the ArXiv publication. After it goes live, we reassess based on how governments and institutions actually respond. If we need Thorne's resources and protection, the offer will still be there. If we don't, we proceed independently."

"And if Thorne was right about everything?" Sofia asked. "If governments immediately move to classify and suppress?"

"Then we learn whether corporate partnership is liberation or just a different kind of cage," Marcus said. "But we make that decision with full information, not out of fear."

The team nodded agreement, and they returned to preparation for the publication that would change everything.

Outside, Evelyn Thorne's helicopter headed back to Santiago, carrying a former scientist who'd built an empire and wondered if she'd lost something essential in the process.

And in the signal streaming from Voyager 2, seventeen alien civilizations continued their patient transmission, teaching humanity mathematics that might save us or reveal our inadequacy.

Sixty-eight hours until the world learned we were being tested.

And somewhere in that countdown, a decision about whether idealism or pragmatism would guide humanity's first contact response.
