# Chapter 41: Six Weeks

The visual confirmation came from the Hubble Space Telescope successor on a clear January night.

Voyager 2, for the first time in forty-seven years, was bright enough to see.

Marcus stood in the control room watching the images resolve on the screen. The probe was still small—just a bright point of light against the darkness—but it was there. Real. Approaching. The Assembled's vessel carrying their judgment of humanity.

"Distance: 0.8 AU and closing," the technician reported. "Velocity steady at 15.2 kilometers per second. Trajectory confirms Earth approach. ETA: forty-five days."

Forty-five days.

Six weeks until first contact or permanent isolation.

"The visual confirmation is going to change everything," Sofia said quietly. "People could believe it was theoretical when it was just radio signals and mathematics. But now they can see it. Now it's real."

She was right. Marcus's phone was already flooding with alerts as news organizations picked up the telescope images. VOYAGER 2 VISIBLE FROM EARTH. ALIEN-MODIFIED PROBE APPROACHING. FIRST CONTACT IN SIX WEEKS.

The world was about to get very loud.

The referendum numbers shifted within hours of the visual confirmation.

"We're at four hundred million participants," Yuki reported. "Sixty percent yes votes, forty percent no. That's a massive surge in participation since the images went public."

"But we're moving backward on percentage," Dr. Rashid said. "We were at sixty-four percent. Now we're at sixty."

Marcus pulled up the demographic analysis. The new participants were different from the early adopters—less tech-savvy, more skeptical, more diverse in their motivations. Some were voting yes because the visual confirmation made contact feel inevitable. Others were voting no for exactly the same reason.

"We're getting the general population now instead of just the enthusiasts," he said. "This is what true democratic participation looks like. Messier. More divided."

"And insufficient," Professor Okafor said. "We need eighty-five percent. We're at sixty with six weeks left and declining. Marcus, the mathematics are brutal. Even if we add a million new yes votes per day, we'd need the no votes to stop growing. Which they're not."

Sofia was monitoring social media feeds. "We've got new factions emerging. Look at this—the Voyager Vigil movement. They're treating the approach as a religious event. Gathering at telescopes, holding prayer services, calling it divine contact."

"That's not necessarily bad," Yuki said. "If they're voting yes—"

"Some are. Some are voting no because they see it as a test of faith that humanity should refuse. And some aren't voting at all because they think the referendum is irrelevant compared to spiritual preparation." Sofia pulled up more feeds. "And then there's the Earth First coalition. They're organizing protests against contact, calling it civilizational surrender. There was a demonstration in Washington yesterday—fifty thousand people demanding we reject the Assembled."

"Peaceful?" Marcus asked.

"Mostly. But there are splinter groups advocating violence. Someone tried to hack a telescope array to prevent observations. Another group is calling for the destruction of our referendum network."

"So we're radicalizing in both directions," Dr. Rashid said. "True believers on one side, violent resisters on the other."

"And the majority in the middle trying to make an informed choice," Marcus added. "Which is exactly what democracy looks like. We can't just count the extremes."

His phone rang. Director Kessler.

"Dr. Reid. We need to talk about the militant factions."

Marcus stepped into a quieter room. "Director."

"The visual confirmation has accelerated radicalization. We're tracking seventeen groups that have made explicit threats against referendum infrastructure or against individuals advocating for contact. Your team is on at least three target lists."

"Are you offering protection?"

"I'm offering information. What you do with it is your choice." Kessler paused. "There's something else. Military commands in four nations are floating the idea of intercepting Voyager before it reaches Earth."

Marcus felt cold settle in his chest. "Intercepting how?"

"Destroying it. They argue that if we're uncertain about consensus, preventing arrival removes the deadline pressure. Gives us more time to decide without an alien vessel in orbit."

"That's insane. The Assembled would see that as hostile action—"

"The Assembled are forty-seven light-years away. By the time they see anything, humanity has either united or collapsed. Some military strategists think eliminating the immediate threat is worth risking long-term consequences."

"It's not a threat. It's first contact."

"To you. To certain military planners, it's an alien vessel of unknown capability approaching Earth. They want to neutralize it while they still can."

Marcus thought about the message the Assembled had sent, about ethics and wisdom, about humanity being tested on how we responded to their offer. Destroying their vessel would be failing the test in the most catastrophic way possible.

"Can you stop them?" he asked.

"I'm trying. But I'm one voice among many, and the voices calling for military intervention are getting louder as the deadline approaches." Kessler's voice was strained. "Your referendum is helping, Marcus. The fact that sixty percent of participants are voting for contact makes it harder to justify hostile action. But sixty isn't eighty-five. If we can't demonstrate clear consensus, the military option becomes more attractive."

"Then we need to reach eighty-five percent."

"With six weeks and a growing no-vote coalition. Dr. Reid, I need you to be realistic. What's your actual probability of success?"

Marcus looked at the data on his screen. Four hundred million participants. Sixty percent yes. Six weeks remaining. They were adding participants rapidly, but the yes percentage was declining as broader populations voted. At current trajectories, they might reach a billion participants by the deadline, but the percentage would drift toward fifty-five percent.

Nowhere near eighty-five.

"I don't know," he admitted. "But I know we have to try."

"Try isn't good enough when the alternative is military strikes against an alien vessel."

"Then what are you suggesting?"

"I'm suggesting you consider what happens if we fail. If we reach the deadline with seventy percent consensus—close, but not enough. Do we accept isolation because we missed an arbitrary threshold? Or do we make contact anyway and hope the Assembled appreciate the effort?"

Marcus understood what Kessler was really asking. Would the Assembled accept near-miss? Would eighty percent be close enough to eighty-five? Could humanity negotiate the terms of the test?

"The message was explicit," Marcus said. "Eighty-five percent through verifiable democratic processes. There's no negotiation clause."

"There's also no enforcement mechanism. The Assembled aren't here. Voyager is just a probe. If we show them eighty percent and call it good enough—"

"Then we fail the ethics test by cheating the parameters." Marcus rubbed his eyes, exhausted. "Director, I know you want certainty. I know military planners want control. But we can't manipulate our way through this. We either pass honestly or we fail honestly. Those are the options."

"Even if failing honestly means we lose our one chance at advancement?"

"Especially then. Because if we're willing to cheat and lie to pass, we haven't actually proven we deserve partnership with advanced civilizations."

Kessler was quiet for a long moment. "You're asking me to have faith."

"Yes."

"In humanity's ability to make the right choice when we've spent most of our history making the wrong ones."

"In humanity's potential to grow. To be better than we've been. Isn't that what the Assembled are testing? Not whether we're perfect, but whether we're capable of improvement?"

"I hope you're right," Kessler said. "Because if you're wrong, we're about to make the most expensive mistake in human history."

He ended the call.

The emergency session was called for the following morning—every major participant in the referendum process, convened in a Geneva conference center under heavy security.

Marcus arrived to find the room packed. Government representatives, civil society organizations, religious leaders, scientists, activists. The full chaotic spectrum of humanity trying to coordinate a collective response to first contact.

The moderator, a calm woman from the International Arbitration Council, opened the session. "We have six weeks until Voyager's arrival. Current referendum data shows sixty percent yes votes from four hundred million participants. We need to address three critical questions: Can we reach eighty-five percent in the time remaining? What happens if we fall short? And how do we respond to emerging threats against the process?"

The next three hours were exhausting. Nations argued about verification standards. Religious groups debated whether the referendum was spiritually legitimate. Activists demanded more resources for offline participation. Security experts warned about cyberattacks and physical threats.

And through it all, the underlying question: are we going to make it?

A representative from the Pacific Island Coalition stood. "We represent nations that will be underwater within a generation if we don't get help with climate change. The Assembled are offering technology that could save our countries. But we're forty-two small nations with a combined population of eleven million. Our yes votes barely register in the global numbers. How is that fair?"

"The test requires consensus, not majority rule," someone countered. "Eighty-five percent means even small populations matter."

"Then how do we achieve consensus when large nations are split?" the representative asked. "China has a billion people and their referendum is showing fifty-five percent yes. India is similar. The NAU is at sixty-two percent but declining. Even if every small nation voted yes unanimously, we couldn't reach eighty-five percent without the major powers achieving higher consensus."

Sofia raised her hand. "Which means we need to address the concerns driving the no votes. What are people afraid of? What questions haven't been answered?"

The moderator pulled up survey data from no voters. The reasons varied widely:

- Fear of losing human independence (28%)
- Religious objections to alien contact (19%)
- Distrust of the referendum process itself (16%)
- Belief the whole thing is a hoax (14%)
- Philosophical opposition to technological acceleration (12%)
- Other/uncertain (11%)

"These aren't irrational positions," Marcus said, studying the data. "These are people with legitimate concerns about what contact means for humanity's future. We can't dismiss them as obstacles. We need to engage with them."

"In six weeks?" Dr. Rashid asked. "You're suggesting we conduct a global conversation addressing every philosophical and religious objection to first contact, while also growing participation and defending against attacks?"

"Yes," Marcus said. "Because that's what ethical consensus-building requires. Not overriding objections, but addressing them honestly."

"It's impossible," someone said.

"It's necessary," Sofia countered. "The Assembled are testing whether we can unite while remaining true to democratic values. That means including dissenting voices, not silencing them."

A religious leader stood. "How do we include voices that see this entire process as demonic deception? I represent communities who believe the Assembled are not advanced aliens but fallen angels testing humanity's faith. They won't participate in any referendum because they see it as spiritually compromising."

"Then we respect their choice," Marcus said. "But we also make clear what the consequences are. If they choose not to participate, they're choosing isolation. That's their right. But it's also their responsibility."

"And if there are enough of them to prevent eighty-five percent consensus? Do we fail the test because some people see it as a test of different kind?"

No one had a good answer.

The session broke for lunch with more questions than solutions. Marcus found himself on the balcony overlooking Geneva, trying to process the overwhelming complexity of what they were attempting.

Yuki joined him. "You know what the worst part is?"

"Tell me."

"Even if we do everything right—address every concern, include every voice, build genuine ethical consensus—we might still fail. Because eighty-five percent is really, really hard. And six weeks is really, really short."

"I know."

"But we're going to try anyway."

"Yes."

"Because failing honestly beats succeeding dishonestly."

"Yes."

Yuki smiled tiredly. "You know, when I first got your email about Voyager, I thought you were probably wrong. Another pattern-recognition specialist seeing patterns that didn't exist. I almost didn't come to Chile."

"I'm glad you did."

"Me too. Even though this is possibly the most stressful experience of my life and we're probably going to fail."

"We might not fail."

"We're at sixty percent with six weeks left, Marcus. The mathematics are really not in our favor."

"Mathematics can change. Consensus can build exponentially."

"Or it can plateau and decline as resistance hardens." She looked at him. "Do you actually believe we can do this? Or are you just saying it because we have to try?"

Marcus thought about the question honestly. Did he believe humanity could reach eighty-five percent consensus in six weeks? Could achieve something unprecedented in our history as a species?

"I believe we have a chance," he said finally. "A real one. Not a certainty, but a possibility. And that's enough to justify trying."

"Even if trying means we might fail publicly, catastrophically, in a way that defines humanity for generations?"

"Especially then. Because the alternative—not trying, or trying dishonestly—is guaranteed failure. At least this way we have a chance."

Yuki nodded slowly. "Okay. Then let's give ourselves the best chance possible. Six weeks. Sixty to eighty-five percent. Should be easy."

She was being sarcastic, but there was determination underneath it.

Inside, the session was resuming. Outside, Voyager continued its approach, visible now to amateur telescopes, growing brighter each night. A reminder that the deadline was real, the test was happening, and humanity's answer would be measured not in intentions but in actions.

Six weeks.

Everything depended on what happened next.
