# Chapter 44: Digital Siege

The attack came at 3:47 AM Geneva time, coordinated across seventeen time zones simultaneously.

Yuki jerked awake to alarms screaming from every device. The referendum network was under assault—not the crude DDoS attacks they'd repelled before, but something far more sophisticated. Targeted exploitation of zero-day vulnerabilities, distributed across thousands of compromised systems, designed to corrupt the blockchain verification layer itself.

Someone was trying to make the referendum results untrustworthy.

She grabbed her laptop and dove into the code, fingers flying across keys while her mind raced through defensive protocols. The volunteer security community was already mobilizing—programmers from forty countries coordinating through encrypted channels, identifying attack vectors, deploying patches, isolating compromised nodes.

"It's state-level sophisticated," reported Chen Wei, one of the lead security volunteers from Beijing. "The kind of resources only major intelligence agencies have. This isn't hacktivists. This is coordinated governmental action."

"Multiple governments," added Priya Sharma from Mumbai. "I'm seeing attack signatures consistent with at least three different national agencies. They're coordinating."

Yuki felt ice in her stomach. Individual nations trying to manipulate the referendum was expected. But multiple nations working together to undermine it meant something had shifted in the geopolitical landscape.

"What's the damage?" she asked.

"They're not trying to change votes directly," Chen said. "They're targeting verification protocols. If they succeed, we won't be able to prove that any given vote is legitimate. The entire referendum becomes questionable."

Which was worse than changing votes. A referendum with suspected fraud was worthless, even if the actual results were clean.

Marcus appeared in her doorway, hair disheveled, looking more exhausted than she'd ever seen him. "How bad?"

"Bad. State-level actors trying to undermine verification. If we can't patch the vulnerabilities fast enough, the referendum loses credibility even if we maintain the count."

"Can you stop them?"

"I don't know. This is... this is really sophisticated, Marcus. They found vulnerabilities I didn't know existed. Multiple zero-days deployed simultaneously. Whoever planned this has been preparing for months."

Her screen flashed—another intrusion detected, this one targeting the offline ballot integration systems. They weren't just attacking the digital network. They were attacking the entire structure.

Sofia joined them, phone pressed to her ear, coordinating with volunteers in the field. "I'm getting reports of physical interference too. Ballot materials confiscated at checkpoints in three countries. Volunteers detained for 'unauthorized activities.' Someone's attacking both vectors."

"Coordinated suppression," Marcus said. "Digital and physical. Timed to maximize impact."

Yuki pulled up the attack analytics. The sophistication was terrifying—adaptive algorithms that evolved when defenses were deployed, distributed command structures that couldn't be shut down at a single point, exploitation chains that suggested months of preparation.

But there was something else. A pattern in the attack code itself.

"Wait," she said, isolating a section of malicious code. "Look at this. The core attack is state-level professional. But there's another layer underneath—commercial security software. Someone's using corporate infrastructure to amplify governmental attacks."

"Prometheus," Marcus said immediately.

"Maybe. But look at the implementation. It's deliberately inefficient. Like... like whoever deployed it wanted to be traced." Yuki ran diagnostic after diagnostic. "The commercial layer is amplifying the attack, but it's also leaving breadcrumbs. Digital signatures that point directly to corporate sources."

"A false flag?" Sofia asked.

"Or someone making sure we know who's attacking us." Yuki thought about the patterns, about what would make sense. "What if someone wanted to expose governmental interference by making it visible through commercial infrastructure?"

Her phone rang. Unknown number. She almost didn't answer, but something made her.

"Dr. Tanaka. You're analyzing the attack patterns right now, aren't you?" Evelyn Thorne's voice, calm and precise.

Yuki felt rage flood through her. "Tell me you're not behind this."

"I'm not. But I know who is, and I can help you stop it. On one condition."

"No conditions. Not after last time—"

"The condition is that you listen for thirty seconds before hanging up. That's all I ask."

Yuki counted to three, forcing herself calm. "Thirty seconds."

"The attack is being coordinated by intelligence agencies from NAU, European Federation, and Asian Coalition. They're using a joint task force established three months ago specifically to interfere with the referendum. I discovered it because they approached Prometheus asking to use our infrastructure for amplification. I said yes, then modified the implementation to leave you evidence trails."

"Why?"

"Because I want them exposed. They're attacking the only legitimate democratic process humanity has for this decision. If they succeed, we default to whatever backroom deals governments negotiate, and that's unacceptable." Thorne paused. "I'm sending you decryption keys for their coordination channels. You'll be able to see every detail of the operation. Use it to expose them publicly."

"And what do you get?"

"The knowledge that I helped preserve democratic legitimacy instead of undermining it. Maybe that's enough."

The call ended. Two seconds later, Yuki received an encrypted file. She ran it through every security protocol she had—no malware, no backdoors, just pure intelligence data.

Coordination logs. Communication intercepts. Operational planning documents.

Proof.

"Thorne just gave us evidence that three major governments are coordinating attacks on the referendum," she told Marcus and Sofia.

"And we trust this why?" Sofia asked.

"We don't. But we can verify it independently. These are coordination channels—if they're real, they'll match the attack patterns we're seeing." Yuki started cross-referencing. The data matched perfectly. Attack timing, vulnerability exploitation sequences, target selection—everything aligned with what she was observing in real-time.

"It's real," she said. "Governments are actively trying to make the referendum untrustworthy."

Marcus pulled up his secure line to Kessler. "Director. We have evidence of coordinated governmental interference in the referendum. Multiple nations working together to undermine verification protocols."

"I know," Kessler said, and he sounded furious. "The NAU component was authorized through channels I don't control. Black budget, national security justification, operating outside normal oversight. I just learned about it an hour ago."

"Can you stop it?"

"Working on it. But the operation has support at high levels—people who think manipulating the referendum is justified to prevent what they see as humanity making a catastrophic choice. They're not trying to change votes. They're trying to make the results questionable enough that governments can ignore them."

"That's still electoral interference."

"Agreed. Which is why I'm burning more bridges to expose it. But Marcus, you need to understand the rationale. These are people who genuinely believe accepting contact with the Assembled is dangerous. They see themselves as protecting humanity by any means necessary."

"Including destroying democratic legitimacy?"

"They'd say there's no democracy in accepting alien domination. That preserving human sovereignty justifies subverting this one process." Kessler's voice was strained. "I don't agree. But I understand their fear."

Yuki was barely listening, focused on deploying emergency patches while the volunteer security network coordinated defense. The attack was relentless—every patched vulnerability revealed two more, every defensive measure met with adaptive counter-measures.

But they were holding. Barely.

"Network integrity at seventy-eight percent," Chen reported. "If we can maintain above seventy, the verification remains statistically sound."

"What happens at below seventy?" Marcus asked.

"We can't guarantee that any individual vote is legitimate. The whole referendum becomes suspect."

Yuki watched the integrity percentage hover between seventy-three and seventy-six, fluctuating as attacks and defenses evolved in real-time. Thousands of volunteers worldwide coordinating through encrypted channels, deploying patches, isolating compromised systems, maintaining the infrastructure that let humanity make this choice.

And opposed by governmental agencies with billions in resources, convinced they were protecting humanity by preventing the choice from being made cleanly.

"Why is Thorne helping us?" Sofia asked Yuki. "Last time she tested us by attacking. What's her angle now?"

"I don't know," Yuki admitted. "Maybe she's genuinely choosing a side. Maybe she sees governmental interference as worse than corporate interference. Or maybe..." She thought about her former mentor, about the physicist who'd abandoned research for profit. "Maybe she's trying to remember who she used to be."

Marcus's phone chimed. Public message from Thorne, broadcast through every major news network:

*I am Evelyn Thorne, CEO of Prometheus Space Industries. I am releasing classified evidence that intelligence agencies from NAU, European Federation, and Asian Coalition are coordinating cyberattacks against the referendum network. Their goal is to make democratic participation untrustworthy so governments can ignore popular consensus. This is unacceptable. Democracy under alien evaluation must be genuine or it's meaningless.*

The evidence followed—coordination logs, attack plans, authorization documents. Everything needed to prove governmental interference.

The political firestorm was immediate. News organizations erupted. Government spokespeople scrambled to deny or justify. The UN General Assembly called emergency sessions. And critically, the cyberattacks stopped as exposure forced operations into shutdown.

Network integrity stabilized at eighty-one percent.

"She burned her governmental relationships to protect the referendum," Sofia said, watching the news coverage. "That's going to have consequences."

"Why would she do it?" Marcus asked. "What does she gain?"

Yuki thought about the question. Thorne had spent years building influence through governmental contracts, intelligence connections, political leverage. She'd just destroyed most of that to expose interference in a referendum that might fail anyway.

What did she gain?

Unless she wasn't trying to gain anything. Unless she was trying to be someone different than who she'd become.

"She's choosing ethics over profit," Yuki said quietly. "Maybe for the first time in years."

The referendum numbers updated as the attack effects were filtered out:

Total participants: 723 million
Yes votes: 438 million (60.6%)
No votes: 285 million (39.4%)

The percentage had barely moved, but the integrity was preserved. The referendum remained trustworthy despite coordinated governmental attempts to undermine it.

"Twenty-eight days until Voyager arrives," Dr. Rashid reported. "We're at 60.6% with verification intact. The process survived."

"But we're still nowhere near eighty-five percent," Sofia said.

"We're somewhere near honest," Marcus countered. "That has to count for something."

Yuki looked at the code scrolling across her screens—layers of defense built by thousands of volunteers, maintained through constant vigilance, protecting humanity's right to choose freely. The Assembled were testing ethics and intelligence both.

Maybe surviving governmental interference while maintaining democratic integrity was part of passing the ethics test.

Even if the numbers weren't where they needed to be.

Her phone chimed. Message from Thorne: *The third-party security audit you requested is complete. Network integrity verified at 81%. You did good work. - ET*

Yuki stared at the message. Thorne hadn't just exposed governmental interference. She'd provided independent verification that the referendum remained trustworthy.

Why?

The answer came slowly: because Thorne needed to prove to herself that she could still choose knowledge over power, truth over profit, ethics over expedience.

Just like humanity was being tested.

Maybe everyone was growing. Imperfectly, late, but genuinely.

And maybe growth was what the Assembled were really looking for.
