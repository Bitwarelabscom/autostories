# Chapter 57: Countdown to Contact

The kinetic interceptor would reach Voyager in sixty-eight hours.

Marcus watched the tracking data from Geneva headquarters, the missile's trajectory a cold mathematical certainty cutting through space toward humanity's one chance at contact with advanced civilizations.

Thorne's global broadcast had bought them awareness. The world knew a rogue military faction had launched despite the 75% consensus. But awareness didn't change physics. The missile was already in space, already locked on course, already carrying the violent answer certain humans had chosen over dialogue.

"Can Voyager defend itself?" Sofia asked, watching the same data.

"We don't know," Marcus said. "The Assembled modified it with technology we don't understand. It might have defensive capabilities. Or it might just be a probe carrying a message, vulnerable to kinetic impact."

"And if it's destroyed?"

"Then we fail both tests simultaneously. We'd be demonstrating that even after achieving seventy-five percent consensus, our violent minority can override majority will. That's exactly the kind of division the Assembled were testing for."

The referendum numbers had surged again after Thorne's broadcast—people flooding in to make sure their votes counted before the missile hit, before humanity's choice was made irrelevant by violence.

Current: 1.89 billion participants, 76.1% yes

Seventy-six point one percent. Higher than the threshold. Higher than they'd dreamed possible weeks ago. But potentially meaningless if a kinetic interceptor destroyed Voyager before the Assembled could evaluate humanity's answer.

"Three days until Voyager arrives," Yuki reported. "Assuming the missile doesn't destroy it first. Sixty-eight hours until potential impact."

Marcus thought about timing. The missile would reach Voyager roughly twelve hours before Voyager reached Earth orbit. Twelve hours for the Assembled to see humanity's choice—76% consensus for contact—before seeing humanity's violence destroy their probe.

What message did that send? "We mostly choose dialogue, but our violent elements might kill you anyway"?

That was failure. Absolute, unambiguous failure.

His phone rang. General Reeves.

"Dr. Reid. I'm mobilizing every resource I have to intercept the rogue missile. So are Generals Chen and Okonkwo. We're trying to reach it before it reaches Voyager."

"Can you?"

"I don't know. It's moving fast, it's in deep space, and the faction that launched it designed it specifically to be hard to intercept. But we're trying." Reeves paused. "Marcus, I'm sorry. I helped authorize Guardian Shield initially. I thought destroying Voyager was protecting humanity. I was wrong. And now a rogue cell is doing what I stopped the official operation from doing. This is partly my responsibility."

"You changed your mind," Marcus said. "You chose growth over your initial position. That's what the test is about."

"Then let me demonstrate that growth by stopping this missile. Give me sixty-eight hours."

The call ended. Marcus looked at his team—Sofia coordinating final referendum push, Yuki monitoring the missile trajectory, Dr. Rashid preparing documentation of everything humanity had achieved.

And Marcus himself, about to address the world one final time before Voyager arrived.

Not as a data analyst. Not as a pattern-recognition specialist. But as the person who'd discovered this situation and helped humanity navigate it.

A role he'd never wanted but had grown into anyway.

"I need to prepare my speech," he said. "For when Voyager arrives. Whether the missile hits or not, whether we succeed or fail, humanity deserves to hear what we accomplished and what we learned."

Sofia looked at him. "You're going to speak for humanity?"

"No. I'm going to speak about humanity. What we tried to do. How we grew. Why 76% consensus through ethical means matters even if violence destroys it. Someone needs to say it for the record."

He went to a quiet room and started writing. Not a victory speech—success wasn't certain. Not a eulogy—failure wasn't guaranteed. Just an honest accounting of humanity's eighteen-month journey from first discovery to final answer.

The words came slowly, painfully, built from everything they'd learned:

*We discovered we weren't alone in the universe. And we chose to respond not with unified certainty, but with diverse honesty...*

*We divided along every line humans divide—nation, religion, ideology, experience. And we chose to include those divisions in our answer instead of suppressing them...*

*We were tested on intelligence and ethics both. We found the hidden pattern you embedded, demonstrating we could see beyond stated problems. We built consensus through transparent democracy, demonstrating we valued ethical means as much as desired ends...*

*We're not perfect. 76% isn't 100%. Our violent elements launched a missile against our majority will. But we're trying. Growing. Demonstrating potential even when achievement is partial...*

The words filled pages. Marcus refined them, restructured them, worked them until they captured what humanity had done—imperfectly, incompletely, but genuinely.

This was his pattern recognition moment. Not seeing signals in data, but seeing meaning in humanity's messy, fractious, beautiful attempt to answer the biggest question we'd ever faced.

"It's ready," he told the team twelve hours later.

"Ready for what?" Dr. Rashid asked.

"For whatever happens. If the missile hits, I speak to explain what we tried to accomplish. If Voyager defends itself, I speak to present our answer. If we fail the test entirely, I speak so the record shows we attempted wisdom even if we didn't achieve it."

"That's three different speeches," Sofia said.

"It's one speech," Marcus corrected. "About growth. The outcome doesn't change the journey."

The countdown continued. Fifty-six hours until missile impact. Sixty-eight hours until Voyager arrival. Seventy-six point three percent consensus.

Everything converging toward a single moment when humanity would discover if trying honestly was enough.

Marcus looked at his speech and thought about his grad school dissertation. The pattern he'd seen that wasn't real. The humiliation of being wrong. The years of doubt afterward.

This time the pattern was real. He'd verified it. Billions of people had confirmed it through their participation.

But he might still fail. The missile might hit. The Assembled might reject 76% as insufficient. Humanity might have tried perfectly and still fallen short.

And he'd have to accept that. Because wisdom meant trying without certainty, choosing without guaranteed success, growing without knowing if growth was enough.

The test continued.

And Marcus prepared to speak for humanity one final time.

Whatever the outcome.
