# Chapter 35: Breaking Points

Yuki collapsed during the feasibility presentation.

One moment she was explaining the biometric verification protocols to the commission, the next she was on the floor, out cold. Medical staff rushed in. They found her pulse weak, blood pressure dangerously low, showing signs of severe dehydration and exhaustion.

"How long has she been working?" the medic asked Marcus.

"I... five days? Maybe six?" Marcus realized with horror that he'd lost track. They'd all lost track, caught in the deadline sprint to demonstrate technical feasibility.

"Six days. With how much sleep?"

"Maybe ten hours total."

The medic looked at him with pure disgust. "You're killing yourselves. All of you. For what?"

For the future of human civilization, Marcus thought but didn't say. The medic wouldn't understand. Couldn't understand that sometimes the stakes justified breaking yourself trying.

But watching them load Yuki onto a stretcher, seeing her unconscious face, Marcus wondered if he was wrong about that.

They postponed the feasibility demonstration. Yuki recovered after twelve hours of sleep and IV fluids, but the medical staff forbade her from returning to work for at least forty-eight hours. She argued. They threatened to sedate her. She grudgingly agreed to rest.

Which left the rest of the team scrambling to finish the technical demonstrations without their cryptography expert.

"We can't do this without her," Dr. Rashid said over the video link. "The zero-knowledge proofs are her specialty. I can't verify the protocols, let alone explain them to skeptical commission members."

"Then we delay again," Marcus said. "Ask for another week."

"The commission won't grant it. They're already skeptical. Delaying twice looks like we can't deliver."

"Then we deliver what we can. Partial demonstrations. Proof of concept rather than full implementation."

Sofia, who'd been silent during the discussion, suddenly stood. "I need to go check on the São Paulo network. They're reporting issues with the education distribution."

"Sofia, São Paulo is eight time zones away and it's the middle of their night. Whatever issues they're having can wait until morning."

"Their morning is five hours from now. I'll catch them before—"

"Sofia." Marcus's voice was sharper than he intended. "You're making excuses to avoid dealing with the fact that we're failing."

She turned on him. "I'm trying to actually help instead of sitting here having the same useless conversation about feasibility demonstrations that won't convince anyone anyway."

"The demonstrations are the condition for commission support—"

"The commission doesn't matter! They're a bureaucratic delay on what we should have been doing from the beginning. Building grassroots support directly instead of begging institutions for permission."

"We need resources the commission controls. Funding, infrastructure access, international coordination—"

"We needed those things for the old approach. The ethics-compliant system bypasses institutions. We should be organizing communities, not optimizing presentations for skeptical officials who are going to oppose us regardless."

"You don't know that they'll oppose us."

"I know that fifteen voted in favor and ten voted against, which means we have thin support that will evaporate the moment we hit real obstacles. Like our chief cryptographer collapsing from exhaustion. Like missing deadlines. Like the fact that we're still at 31% consensus with five months left and no credible path to 85%."

Marcus felt anger flash through him. "So we give up? Stop trying to work within available systems and just... what? Hope grassroots organizing magically solves everything?"

"It's not magic. It's actual democracy. People talking to people, building genuine consensus from the ground up instead of manufactured consensus from the top down. That's what the ethics test is measuring."

"And while you're organizing your perfect grassroots democracy, who's building the technical infrastructure to make votes actually count? Who's solving the cryptographic problems that prevent fraud? Who's creating verification systems the Assembled will accept?"

"Yuki was doing that, and we worked her into collapse. Maybe that's a sign we're trying to do too much through too few people."

"Then help us! Instead of running off to São Paulo or wherever else you can find to avoid the hard work of actually implementing these systems."

Sofia's expression went cold. "Hard work? Marcus, I've been organizing across Latin America for four months. Fifty million people in grassroots networks talking about contact, education, genuine consensus-building. While you've been in Geneva having meetings about meetings, I've been doing the actual democracy work."

"Organizing isn't enough without infrastructure to channel it into measurable consensus—"

"And infrastructure isn't enough without people who actually believe in what they're voting for! You're so focused on technical correctness you've forgotten that the ethics test is about people, not protocols."

They were both shouting now. Dr. Rashid had muted himself on the call, diplomatically pretending not to hear. But the rest of the small team in the room was watching, uncomfortable with the confrontation.

Ambassador Chen intervened. "Both of you, stop. This isn't productive."

"Nothing's productive!" Sofia shot back. "That's the problem. We've been spinning our wheels for five months, and we're worse off than when we started. Consensus down from 54% to 31%, eighty-two people dead, and we're arguing about feasibility demonstrations that won't change anything."

"They'll change commission support—" Marcus started.

"I don't care about commission support! I care about passing the test. And we're not going to pass by optimizing failed institutional processes. We pass by building something genuinely new. Which requires abandoning the commission, abandoning the institutional framework, and trusting people to organize themselves."

"That's anarchist fantasy—"

"That's democracy! Actual democracy, not the managed consent you and Kessler have been pursuing."

"I'm nothing like Kessler—"

"You're exactly like Kessler. You both think governance requires experts making decisions for people too stupid or chaotic to decide for themselves. The only difference is you dress it up in ethics language while he's honest about wanting control."

That hit Marcus like a physical blow. Because there was truth in it. He had been trying to design systems that would produce the right outcome. Making the ethics-compliant referendum technically sound, but still fundamentally about guiding people toward the choice he thought was correct.

"That's not fair," he said quietly.

"Isn't it? Marcus, when's the last time you talked to someone who opposed contact? Actually listened to their concerns instead of figuring out how to change their mind?"

"I... the anti-contact perspectives are represented in the information we're distributing—"

"Represented by us. Filtered through our framing. Presented in ways designed to make pro-contact seem more reasonable. That's not genuine dialogue. That's manipulation with better ethics justifications."

Marcus wanted to argue, but couldn't find the words. Because she was right. They'd been so focused on passing the test that they'd lost sight of what the test was actually measuring: genuine democratic capability, not clever system design.

"So what do you want me to do?" he asked, exhausted.

"I want you to stop trying to control the outcome. Build infrastructure that enables choice, then trust people to make it. Even if they choose wrong. Even if we fail."

"And if we fail, eight billion people miss out on partnership with the Assembled. Extended lifespan, clean energy, medical advances—all gone because we were too principled to guide people toward the obviously better choice."

"If we pass through manipulation, we don't deserve the partnership. We'd just be proving we can fake unity while remaining fundamentally divided and dishonest."

They stared at each other across an unbridgeable gap. Marcus saw someone who valued moral purity over outcomes. Sofia saw someone who'd become what they were fighting against.

Ambassador Chen spoke softly. "You're both exhausted. Sofia, you're right that grassroots organizing matters. Marcus, you're right that infrastructure is necessary. You don't actually disagree about strategy. You disagree about which you personally should focus on, and you're both overextended trying to do everything."

"We don't have enough people to specialize," Marcus said.

"Then we get more people. We've been operating as small team trying to coordinate global movement. That's structurally impossible. We need to distribute the work, trust others to carry pieces of it, stop trying to manage everything centrally."

"That's exactly what I've been saying," Sofia said.

"And Marcus has been saying we need the infrastructure to make distribution possible. You're complementary, not contradictory. But you're both too tired and stressed to see it."

A message arrived on Marcus's tablet. From Kessler: *Global protest update. NAU protests now at 2 million participants in 47 cities. Asian Coalition matching numbers. Both coordinated and escalating. You need to see this.*

Marcus pulled up the protest tracking. The numbers were staggering. Over a hundred million people in the streets globally. Half pro-contact, half anti-contact. The largest coordinated demonstrations in human history.

And the violence was spreading. Not mass casualties like Cairo, but dozens of small incidents. Fights, vandalism, harassment. The low-grade conflict that defined societies tearing themselves apart.

"This is what we're trying to prevent," he said, showing Sofia the data. "If we don't pass the test, this becomes permanent. Humanity divided into hostile camps over a question that should unite us."

"Or," Sofia said, "this is humanity working through a genuinely difficult decision. Messy, confrontational, but real. The Assembled aren't testing whether we can avoid conflict. They're testing whether we can resolve it ethically."

"By getting people killed?"

"By finding ways to channel disagreement into non-violent resolution. Which the old institutional framework failed at, and your technical infrastructure alone won't solve. It requires the grassroots organizing you keep dismissing."

Marcus looked at the protest numbers, at the feasibility demonstration notes, at the consensus tracker still stuck at 31%. Everything was failing. The technical approach, the grassroots approach, the institutional approach. All producing the same result: slow collapse toward inevitable failure.

"I don't know what to do anymore," he admitted.

Sofia's expression softened slightly. "Neither do I. But I know we can't keep doing what we've been doing and expect different results."

"So we change. To what?"

"I don't know. But maybe not knowing is part of the test. Maybe the Assembled are watching whether we can pivot when approaches fail, whether we can learn and adapt instead of just optimizing the same strategies harder."

That almost made sense. Almost gave Marcus hope.

Then another alert: Yuki's medical team reporting she'd tried to leave the hospital against medical advice. They'd sedated her to prevent self-harm through overwork.

Sedated. Their cryptography expert sedated because she literally couldn't stop working herself to death.

"We're breaking," Marcus said. "Yuki collapsed, you and I are fighting, protests are escalating, consensus is dropping. Everything's breaking."

"Then maybe we need to break," Sofia said. "Maybe we need to hit bottom before we can find a different approach."

"Or maybe hitting bottom means we've failed and there's no recovery."

"Five months to find out."

She left. Marcus stayed, looking at the screens showing protests, the medical update on Yuki, the consensus tracker that refused to budge upward.

Ambassador Chen sat beside him. "She's not wrong, you know. About needing to trust people more."

"I know. But I'm terrified that trusting people means accepting we'll fail."

"Maybe. Or maybe trying to control the outcome is what's making failure inevitable. Control and trust are inversely related. The more you try to manage consensus, the less authentic it becomes."

"So I let go? Just build infrastructure and hope people use it well?"

"You build infrastructure that enables good choices and constrains bad ones. Then yes, you let go. Because the alternative is building systems that make the right choice for people, which isn't democracy."

Marcus thought about that. About the difference between enabling and directing. About whether he was capable of building something and then trusting others to use it in ways he couldn't control or predict.

The protests continued. Yuki slept in medical restraints. Sofia organized her networks in São Paulo. The consensus tracker showed 31.1%.

And somewhere above, Voyager approached, carrying observers who were watching humanity's every choice, every failure, every desperate attempt to prove they deserved partnership.

Five months remained.

Marcus had no idea if that was enough time to learn what the test was really measuring.

But he knew that what they'd been doing wasn't working.

So something had to change.

The question was what.

And whether they'd figure it out before everything broke beyond repair.
