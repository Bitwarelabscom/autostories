# Chapter 27: Corporate Conspiracy

The encrypted file arrived in Marcus's inbox at 3:17 AM with no subject line and a sender address that didn't exist.

He almost deleted it. Almost. But something about the timestamp—exactly when Voyager's latest ping should have arrived—made him pause. He ran it through Yuki's security scanner, confirmed it was clean, and opened it.

Inside was a single PDF document labeled "Project Covenant - Technical Specifications."

Marcus read the first page and felt his blood run cold.

"She's going to intercept it."

Sofia looked up from her coffee, eyes bleary from another fourteen-hour day coordinating grassroots referendum efforts across South America. They were working out of a rented office in Geneva now, closer to the UN coordination efforts, though still operating independently from governmental oversight.

"Who's intercepting what?"

"Thorne. Prometheus Industries." Marcus turned his laptop around, showing her the document. "They've been building a spacecraft in secret for the past four months. Fast courier design, nuclear propulsion, capable of matching Voyager's trajectory. They're planning to reach it three weeks before it arrives at Earth."

Sofia grabbed the laptop and started scrolling. Her expression darkened with each page. "This is detailed. Mission parameters, engineering specifications, launch windows... Marcus, where did you get this?"

"Anonymous leak. Sent to me specifically. Someone inside Prometheus wants this stopped."

"Or wants us to stop it for them." Sofia kept reading. "Launch date is six weeks from now. Crew of four, all Prometheus employees. Mission objective: 'secure alien technology for analysis and corporate partnership opportunities.'" She looked up. "They're trying to monopolize first contact."

"Not first contact. First access." Marcus pulled up the mission timeline. "Look at the approach vector. They're not trying to communicate with the Assembled through Voyager. They're trying to physically retrieve technology from the probe before it reaches Earth. Reverse-engineer it, patent it, corner the market before anyone else gets a look."

"Can they do that? Legally?"

"Space law is murky on salvage rights for alien-modified human property." Marcus had been researching this since opening the file. "Voyager 2 was built by NASA, but Prometheus could argue that once it left human space, it became derelict. If they retrieve it in international waters—or space, rather—they could claim salvage rights."

Sofia swore in Spanish. "This destroys everything. The referendum process, the international cooperation, the whole test. If one corporation seizes Voyager and claims exclusive access to alien technology, every nation will see it as theft. We'll have a space race, probably a shooting war. The 85% consensus becomes impossible."

"I know."

"So we leak it. Immediately. Expose Thorne's plan before she can execute it."

Marcus had been thinking about that for the past hour. "And then what? We're six months into the referendum process. Consensus is building slowly, painfully, but it's building. If we reveal that Thorne—who's been publicly supporting the coordinated referendum—is secretly planning to sabotage it for corporate profit, we shatter what trust remains. The whole process collapses."

"It's going to collapse anyway when she launches!"

"Not if we can stop her without going public."

Sofia stared at him. "You want to confront Thorne privately? Marcus, she's not going to just abandon a multi-billion dollar mission because you ask nicely."

"No, but she might if we give her a better alternative." Marcus pulled up another section of the document. "Look at the cost. Eight billion dollars for the spacecraft, another three for the crew training and mission support. That's an enormous investment, even for Prometheus. She's taking a massive risk."

"Because she thinks the payoff is bigger. Alien technology worth trillions."

"But what if the technology is worthless to her? What if the Assembled see this kind of corporate seizure as proof that humanity failed the ethics test?" Marcus was thinking out loud now, following the logic. "Thorne's a scientist underneath the corporate exterior. She wants the knowledge. If we can convince her that her plan guarantees we fail the test and lose everything, maybe she backs down."

Sofia looked skeptical. "You're giving her a lot of credit for hidden idealism."

"You didn't see her face at the UN summit. When she talked about the answers the Assembled could provide. That wasn't corporate greed. That was genuine scientific passion."

"Passion she's willing to betray for profit."

"Or passion she thinks she's protecting by ensuring someone secures the technology." Marcus stood, his decision made. "I'm going to talk to her. Before we leak this, before we destroy the fragile cooperation we've built. Let me try to reach whatever's left of the scientist in Evelyn Thorne."

"And if there's nothing left?"

"Then we leak it and deal with the chaos." Marcus grabbed his jacket. "But we owe it to the three billion people working toward consensus to try the less destructive option first."

Prometheus Industries headquarters in Geneva was a monument to corporate ambition—forty stories of steel and glass, topped with a literal observation deck overlooking the city. Marcus had to pass through three security checkpoints before reaching Thorne's executive floor.

She was waiting in her office, which surprised him. He'd expected to fight through assistants and schedulers. Instead, Thorne sat behind her minimalist desk, looking at him with an expression of weary resignation.

"Dr. Reid. I was wondering when you'd show up." She gestured to a chair. "Coffee? I have an excellent espresso machine."

"You knew I'd find out."

"I was counting on it." Thorne stood and walked to the window, looking out over Geneva. "You're predictable, Marcus. May I call you Marcus? Someone leaks you information about potential malfeasance, you investigate. That's who you are."

"Did you leak it yourself?"

"No. But I know who did. A chief engineer who thought the mission was too risky, both technically and ethically. I've already accepted her resignation." Thorne turned back to him. "So. You've seen the specs. What are you going to do about it?"

Marcus hadn't expected this level of directness. "That depends. Are you really planning to intercept Voyager and monopolize alien technology?"

"Planning? No. I've already built the spacecraft, trained the crew, and scheduled the launch. Planning implies something hypothetical."

"Why?"

Thorne laughed, but there was no humor in it. "Why? Because I'm a greedy corporate monster who sees first contact as a profit opportunity? That's what you think of me."

"I think you're more complicated than that."

"How flattering." Thorne returned to her desk and pulled up her own display. "Let me show you something. This is the global consensus tracker. Real-time aggregation of all referendum processes worldwide. What's our current percentage?"

Marcus knew the number. They all knew the number. "Forty-two percent."

"Forty-two percent," Thorne repeated. "After six months of coordination, billions spent on education campaigns, unprecedented international cooperation. We're not even halfway to the threshold. And we have six months left, during which consensus typically becomes harder, not easier, as people's initial enthusiasm gives way to skepticism and fear."

"So you've decided we're going to fail."

"I've decided we need a contingency." Thorne leaned forward. "What happens if we reach the deadline with 70% consensus? Or 80%? Close enough to feel the loss, but not enough to pass? The Assembled withdraw, taking their knowledge and technology with them. Humanity is left with nothing except the certainty that we failed our one chance at advancement."

"That's the test. Pass or fail."

"Unless we hedge our bets." Thorne pulled up the mission profile for her Voyager intercept. "If my crew reaches Voyager before it arrives at Earth, we get access to at least some alien technology. Not the full partnership, but something. We can study it, learn from it, maybe make enough progress that when the Assembled check back in a few centuries, we've proven ourselves worthy after all."

"That's not how it works. The message was clear—"

"The message was an ultimatum from beings far more powerful than us. Unite or be isolated. But ultimatums sometimes have loopholes." Thorne's voice was intense now, persuasive. "The Assembled are testing our unity, yes. But they're also rational beings. If we show initiative, if we demonstrate that even in the absence of their help we're willing to reach for advancement, maybe that impresses them. Maybe that's actually the test—not passive unity, but active striving."

Marcus shook his head. "You don't believe that."

"I don't know what I believe!" For the first time, Thorne's corporate composure cracked. "I believe we're being tested by aliens we don't understand using criteria we can't fully interpret. I believe humanity is fundamentally fractious and probably incapable of 85% consensus on anything. And I believe that doing something is better than doing nothing while we watch our one chance slip away."

"Even if the something you're doing guarantees we fail the ethics test?"

"What ethics test?" Thorne demanded. "They said intelligence and unity. They didn't say anything about ethics."

Marcus pulled out his tablet and showed her the passage from the Assembled's message he'd highlighted weeks ago. "Species that cannot achieve this level of unity before developing advanced technology invariably destroy themselves. They're not just testing whether we can unite. They're testing whether we can unite ethically, through legitimate processes, without coercion or fraud. Your plan is the opposite of that."

Thorne read the passage, her jaw tight. "That's interpretation, not explicit instruction."

"It's the only interpretation that makes sense. If the Assembled just wanted to see if we could coordinate, they'd test our logistics. They're testing our unity because unity requires trust, cooperation, shared values—all the things that make advanced technology safe instead of destructive."

"And if you're wrong? If I'm the one interpreting correctly, and my mission is actually showing the kind of initiative they want to see?"

"Then you're gambling three billion people's future on your ego."

Thorne went very still. When she spoke again, her voice was cold. "Be very careful what you say next, Dr. Reid."

Marcus met her gaze. "You were a scientist once. You told me at the UN that you wanted the Assembled's knowledge because you still cared about answers. But this isn't about answers. This is about control. About making sure that if humanity gets alien technology, you're the one who owns it."

"I never said own. I said priority access—"

"Which you'll monetize. Patent. License. Turn into proprietary advantage for Prometheus Industries and its shareholders. You're not hedging against failure, Evelyn. You're hedging against success that doesn't benefit you personally."

Thorne stood abruptly. "This meeting is over."

"I'm going to stop you." Marcus stayed seated. "I'll leak the mission specs. I'll contact the space agencies whose launch corridors you'll be violating. I'll make sure every government on Earth knows you're planning to sabotage the consensus process for corporate profit."

"And in doing so, you'll destroy what's left of international cooperation. Governments will fracture into competing camps—those who want to copy my approach and those who want to criminalize it. The referendum process collapses, we miss the 85% threshold, and the Assembled leave anyway. Congratulations, you've accomplished nothing except ensuring we all lose together."

She was right, and they both knew it.

"There's another option," Marcus said quietly. "Cancel the mission. Commit your resources to the legitimate referendum process instead. Help us reach 85% honestly."

"We're at 42%," Thorne said. "Forty-two percent after six months of trying. The mathematics are not in our favor."

"Mathematics can change. Consensus can build exponentially as more people see their neighbors participating. We're not doomed yet."

"No, just probably doomed. And I'm not willing to bet humanity's future on probably."

Marcus stood. "Then you're not the scientist you pretend to be. A scientist accepts uncertainty. Lives with it. Doesn't try to cheat the experiment because the results might not go their way."

He headed for the door.

"Marcus." Thorne's voice stopped him. "What are you going to do?"

"I don't know yet." He turned back. "But I know what you should do. Remember why you became a scientist in the first place. Remember that knowledge is worth more than control. And ask yourself if the Evelyn Thorne who chose physics over profit would approve of the person you've become."

He left, not waiting for a response.

Sofia was waiting when he got back to the office. "Well?"

"She's not backing down. The mission is happening."

"Then we leak."

Marcus sat down heavily, suddenly exhausted. "If we leak, we cause exactly the kind of division and chaos that guarantees we fail the test. But if we don't leak, Thorne intercepts Voyager, probably triggers an international incident, and we fail anyway."

"Rock and hard place."

"Yeah."

Yuki appeared in the doorway. "There might be a third option. What if we don't leak to the public? What if we leak to specific governments who would have both the authority and the incentive to stop the launch quietly?"

"Like who?" Sofia asked.

"Like the NAU Space Intelligence Agency. Like Director Kessler."

Marcus shook his head. "Kessler and Thorne are allies. He's not going to act against her."

"Are they though?" Yuki pulled up a file. "I've been tracking their public statements. They present a united front at the UN, but their private interests diverge. Kessler wants governmental control. Thorne wants corporate advantage. Those aren't actually compatible long-term."

"So we drive a wedge between them," Sofia said slowly. "Make Kessler see that Thorne's mission threatens his goal of managed, orderly contact."

"It's manipulative," Marcus said.

"It's strategic." Yuki was already drafting a message. "We send Kessler the specs, framed as intelligence he needs for national security purposes. Let him make the decision about whether to stop Thorne. We're just providing information."

Marcus thought about it. It was still manipulation, still playing political games he hated. But it was less destructive than a public leak, and it gave Kessler the agency to act in what he saw as humanity's best interest.

"Do it," he said. "Send it to Kessler. Anonymously, same as how it came to us. Let him think he has a source inside Prometheus."

"And if he doesn't stop her?" Sofia asked.

"Then we've given him every chance to do the right thing, and the failure is his, not ours." Marcus looked at the mission specs still displayed on his screen. "And then we leak it publicly and let the chips fall where they may."

Yuki sent the message. They watched the confirmation flash across her screen, then sat in silence, waiting to see if they'd just saved the referendum process or merely delayed its inevitable collapse.

Outside, Geneva went about its business, unaware that somewhere in orbit a spacecraft was being prepared to gamble humanity's future on corporate ambition and the eroded idealism of a scientist who'd lost her way.
