# Chapter 36: The Question of Deserving

Marcus found Sofia on the roof three days after their fight. She was watching the sunrise over Geneva, looking small and tired in a way that made his chest ache.

"I'm sorry," he said.

"For which part? Comparing my approach to anarchist fantasy, or trying to control outcomes while pretending to enable choice?"

"Both. All of it." He sat beside her, careful to leave space. "You were right. I've been treating the referendum like a problem to solve rather than a process to facilitate. Designing systems to produce the outcome I think is correct instead of genuinely enabling choice."

Sofia was quiet for a long moment. "And I've been so focused on perfect process that I've ignored practical constraints. Grassroots organizing is beautiful in theory but useless without infrastructure to channel it into measurable consensus. You were right about that."

"So we're both right and both wrong?"

"Apparently."

They watched the sun climb higher, painting Geneva in shades of gold that felt inappropriately beautiful given the circumstances.

"Do you think we can actually pass this test?" Marcus asked.

"Do you want my hopeful answer or my honest one?"

"Honest."

Sofia sighed. "No. I don't think humanity can achieve 85% consensus on anything, let alone something this profound, in the time remaining. We're too divided, too traumatized by history, too committed to competing visions of the future. The mathematics alone make it nearly impossible."

Marcus felt something settle in his chest. Not relief exactly, but clarity. Someone else seeing the same impossible odds.

"But," Sofia continued, "I also think maybe passing isn't the point."

"What do you mean?"

"The Assembled have been watching for 473 years. They retrieved Voyager 78 years ago. They've had decades to study us. They know what humanity is—divided, violent, flawed. They didn't need to run this test to discover that. So why test us at all?"

"To filter for species mature enough for partnership?"

"Maybe. Or to see if we're capable of trying. Of recognizing our flaws and working to overcome them, even when success is unlikely. The test isn't 'are you perfect?' It's 'are you growing?'"

Marcus thought about that. About the months of work, the deaths, the failures, the desperate attempts to build something better than existing systems. They hadn't succeeded. But they had tried things no one had attempted before. Created frameworks for global democracy that didn't exist six months ago. Forced conversations about ethics and legitimacy that institutions usually avoided.

"So you think the Assembled might accept growth even without achieving 85%?"

"I think if we hit 85% through manipulation and manufactured consent, we fail regardless. But if we attempt genuine democratic process, build ethical infrastructure, demonstrate capacity for self-reflection and adaptation... maybe that counts for something. Even if the final number falls short."

"That's hope disguised as pragmatism."

"That's the only kind of hope I have left."

A notification buzzed. Marcus checked his tablet—consensus tracking updated. 32.4%. Up a full percentage point overnight.

"The grassroots networks are starting to show impact," he said, showing Sofia the data. "Slow growth, but growth. First sustained increase in weeks."

"32.4% is still catastrophically below 85%."

"But it's movement in the right direction. After weeks of freefall, we're climbing again."

Sofia took the tablet, examining the demographic breakdowns. "It's coming from regions we're not managing. Places where local organizers are having actual conversations about contact rather than being subjected to intervention campaigns. The growth is organic."

"Which supports your thesis about grassroots organizing."

"And your thesis about needing measurement infrastructure to make it count. We're both right. Annoyingly."

Marcus smiled despite everything. "What if we actually integrated the approaches? Your grassroots organizing plus my technical infrastructure plus institutional resources where they're helpful?"

"That's what we should have been doing from the beginning instead of treating them as competing strategies."

"So we pivot. Completely. No more institutional-first approach with grassroots as supplement. Grassroots-first with institutional support as infrastructure."

"Kessler will hate it. So will half the commission."

"Then they can oppose it. But we move forward anyway."

Sofia looked at him carefully. "Who are you and what happened to cautious, hedge-his-bets Marcus Reid?"

"He realized that hedging has gotten us nowhere. Time to commit fully to something, even if it fails."

"Why now? Why this approach?"

Marcus thought about how to articulate it. "Because I'm tired of pretending I can control this. You were right that control and trust are inversely related. Every time I try to manage the outcome, I undermine the genuine consensus we actually need. So... I'm choosing to trust. To build the best infrastructure I can, then trust people to use it well."

"You realize that could mean we fail? That people might genuinely choose against contact?"

"Then that's their choice. And maybe the Assembled respect genuine refusal more than manipulated acceptance."

"You've become an idealist. It's unsettling."

"You've become a pragmatist. Equally unsettling."

They sat in companionable silence, watching Geneva wake up below them.

"I talked to Yuki yesterday," Sofia said. "In the hospital."

"How is she?"

"Physically recovering. Mentally... she's struggling. Blames herself for collapsing, for letting the team down. I told her the team let her down by allowing her to work herself into medical crisis."

"We all did that. To her and to ourselves."

"She wants to know if it's worth it. All the sacrifice, the suffering, the deaths. If we're going to fail anyway, was it meaningless?"

"What did you tell her?"

"I told her I don't know. But that meaninglessness isn't determined by success or failure. It's determined by whether we tried our best to do the right thing. And despite all our mistakes, I think we have been trying."

"Do you actually believe that?"

Sofia was quiet. "I want to. Some days I do. Other days I think we're just privileged people playing political games while real people die in demonstrations and violence we enabled. The truth is probably somewhere in between."

Marcus understood that uncertainty. He lived in it daily.

"My brother believed in me," Sofia said suddenly. "When no one else did. When I was just a poor kid from Santiago with impossible dreams of becoming a scientist. He worked double shifts to help pay for my education. Gave up his own future for mine. And then he died, shot in a gang fight that had nothing to do with him, just wrong place wrong time."

Marcus hadn't known the details. Sofia rarely talked about her brother.

"He told me, two weeks before he died, that believing you can finish the journey is what makes the first step possible. Not knowing you'll succeed. Just believing you might, enough to try."

"Wise man."

"He was nineteen. Barely more than a kid. But he understood something I'm only now learning—you can't let fear of failure prevent the attempt. Because not trying is guaranteed failure. Trying might fail too, but at least there's a chance."

"So we try. Despite odds. Despite exhaustion. Despite likely failure."

"We try. And maybe the Assembled see that humanity is capable of trying impossible things. Maybe that's enough."

Marcus wanted to believe it. But belief was hard when the numbers were so stark. 32.4% toward an 85% goal. Four and a half months remaining. Mathematical impossibility dressed up as noble effort.

"What if it's not enough?" he asked quietly. "What if we try our best, exhaust every option, break ourselves in the attempt... and still fail? What does that mean for humanity?"

"It means we weren't ready yet. Not failure forever, just failure now. The Assembled said they've been watching for centuries. Maybe they'll check back in a few hundred years, see if we've grown enough."

"That's cold comfort for the billions alive now who miss out on partnership."

"Yes. But it's honest. We can't pass this test through desperation or determination alone. Either we're capable or we're not. Trying to fake capability is worse than admitting we're still developing."

"You sound like you've accepted failure."

"I've accepted that failure is probable. That's different from giving up. I'm still going to organize every community I can reach. Still going to push for genuine democratic process. Still going to believe that maybe, possibly, against odds, we might surprise ourselves. But I'm not going to lie to myself about the likelihood."

Marcus pulled up the projection models. Even with the grassroots bump, best case scenarios showed 45-52% by deadline. A significant improvement over 32%, but nowhere near 85%.

"The gap is unbridgeable through any approach we've conceived," he said, showing her the numbers.

"Then maybe we haven't conceived the right approach yet. Maybe that's still ahead of us."

"Or maybe there is no right approach for species at our development level. Maybe the test is designed to filter for civilizations already capable of this kind of unity, and we're simply not there yet."

"Possible. Likely, even. But I refuse to accept that until we've exhausted every option."

"Even options that seem impossible?"

"Especially those. Because the possible options have already failed."

A message arrived—from Kessler. *Emergency commission meeting. NAU and Asian Coalition presenting competing proposals for referendum restructuring. Your presence requested.*

"The institutions are fracturing," Marcus said, showing Sofia the message. "Whatever unified approach existed is falling apart."

"Good. Maybe that's what needs to happen. Break the old systems completely so something new can emerge."

"Or break everything and be left with chaos."

"Same thing, sometimes. Chaos is just order that hasn't found its pattern yet."

They headed down from the roof together, back into the grinding work of attempting impossible tests and organizing fractured civilizations.

32.4% consensus. 52.6 percentage points to go. Four months and seventeen days remaining.

The mathematics said failure was certain.

The attempt continued anyway.

Because as Sofia's brother understood and as they were slowly learning: belief that you might succeed is what makes the first step possible.

Even when every subsequent step reveals how impossible the journey actually is.

You try anyway.

Because the alternative is giving up before you've exhausted every option.

And humanity, for all its flaws, had never been good at giving up.

Even when maybe it should.
