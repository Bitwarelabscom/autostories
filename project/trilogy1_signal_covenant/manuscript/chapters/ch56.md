# Chapter 56: Three Days

The alert came through at 06:17 UTC on a Monday morning that would define human history.

**UNAUTHORIZED LAUNCH DETECTED - VANDENBERG SPACE FORCE BASE**

**TRAJECTORY: INTERCEPT COURSE WITH VOYAGER 2**

**ESTIMATED IMPACT: 71 HOURS**

Marcus stared at the notification, his blood turning cold. Despite Kessler's exposure of Operation Guardian Shield, despite the political chaos and public outcry, someone had launched anyway.

"They're going to destroy it," Sofia said, reading the same alert. "Three days before it arrives. Three days before we find out if we passed."

The consensus tracker on the main screen showed 74.8%. So close. Hours away from seventy-five percent, days away from eighty-five if the momentum held. And now a kinetic interceptor was screaming through space toward Voyager, carrying the violent answer certain factions had always preferred to dialogue.

Yuki burst into the room. "It's a rogue launch. Not officially authorized. Some military faction pulled resources together and did it anyway."

"Can it be stopped?" Marcus asked.

"Kessler's trying. But the missile's already in space, already locked on trajectory. To intercept it would require..." She trailed off, checking calculations. "Would require technology we don't have time to deploy."

"So we just watch? We sit here and watch them destroy our one chance at contact?"

"Unless Voyager defends itself," Yuki said quietly.

The room went silent. None of them had considered that possibility. Voyager wasn't just a probe anymore—it was alien-modified, carrying technology beyond human understanding. If the Assembled had given it defensive capabilities...

"That might be part of the test too," Sofia said. "How we respond to violence. Not just whether we can achieve consensus, but whether we can maintain it even when our worst elements act out."

Marcus's phone rang. It was Thorne.

"Marcus. I saw the launch. I need you to trust me one more time."

"What are you planning?"

"I still have access to Prometheus's satellite network. I can broadcast the third-option proof globally, override every channel, make it impossible for anyone to miss. Show the world what we're about to lose because one faction chose violence."

"That's illegal. Broadcasting hijack, emergency system interference—"

"I'm already dissolving the company. What are they going to do, arrest me? Fine. Worth it." Thorne's voice was fierce. "Marcus, we're at seventy-five percent. We achieved it. We found the third option and we reached the threshold. But if that missile hits Voyager, it won't matter. The Assembled will see humanity as violent and divided. We'll fail both tests simultaneously."

"So you want to broadcast the proof to... what? Shame the people who launched?"

"To remind everyone what's at stake. To give people a chance to respond. Maybe we can't stop the missile, but we can make sure the Assembled see that it doesn't represent humanity's choice. That the vast majority of us chose different."

Marcus thought about it. A global broadcast hijacking was exactly the kind of authoritarian move they'd been fighting against. But doing nothing while a rogue military action destroyed first contact was equally unacceptable.

"Do it," he said. "But make it transparent. Identify yourself, explain what you're doing, make it clear this is your choice. No hidden manipulation."

"Understood. Give me ten minutes to set it up."

Marcus turned to the team. "Yuki, where are we on verification of the third option proof?"

"Complete. Seventeen independent institutions have confirmed the mathematical structure. The tertiary stability point is real. We've got everything documented."

"Then we present it. Now. Globally. We show the world that we found the third option, we reached seventy-five percent consensus, and we demonstrated humanity's capacity for growth. Before that missile hits."

"And if it hits anyway?" Dr. Rashid asked.

"Then at least the Assembled will see that we tried. That most of us chose wisdom over violence, even if our worst elements couldn't."

The screens flickered. Thorne's broadcast was starting.

---

Every screen on Earth interrupted simultaneously. News broadcasts, entertainment programs, social media streams—all of them replaced by the same image: Evelyn Thorne standing in what was clearly the command center of Prometheus Industries.

"My name is Dr. Evelyn Thorne. What I'm doing right now is illegal. I'm hijacking emergency broadcast systems and satellite networks to deliver a message that cannot wait. In three days, humanity's response to the Assembled's offer will be evaluated. Seventy-five minutes ago, an unauthorized military strike was launched against Voyager 2 by rogue elements attempting to destroy first contact."

Images appeared—tracking data showing the missile's trajectory, countdown timers showing impact in 71 hours.

"This action does not represent humanity's choice. Over the past two weeks, we achieved seventy-five percent global consensus supporting contact. We discovered a third option in the Assembled's mathematics—a provisional relationship that acknowledges our growth potential while recognizing we're not yet ready for full partnership."

The screen filled with mathematical proofs, simplified for public understanding but detailed enough to show the rigor behind the claims.

"The majority of humanity chose dialogue. Chose to demonstrate our potential. Chose to grow." Thorne's voice cracked slightly. "And now a small fraction is trying to override that choice with violence. I'm broadcasting this so the Assembled will know—so everyone will know—that violence is not our answer. Most of us chose different. Most of us deserve a chance."

She stepped back, and the broadcast shifted to Marcus.

"Dr. Marcus Reid, the scientist who first discovered the Voyager anomaly. Dr. Thorne gave me control of this broadcast. I'm using it to present humanity's proof."

The screen split into multiple views—Yuki's mathematical verification, Sofia's grassroots referendum data, Kessler's testimony about stopping the official military strike, testimonies from millions of people who'd participated in the referendum.

"We're not perfect," Marcus said. "We're divided, flawed, struggling to overcome generations of conflict and tribalism. But we're trying. Seventy-five percent of humanity chose to try. We found the third option you embedded in your mathematics. We demonstrated the intelligence and cooperation you were testing for. And now we're asking—please don't judge us by the violence of our worst elements. Judge us by the wisdom of our majority."

Behind him, the consensus tracker showed 75.2% and climbing as people who'd been watching the deadline with anxiety flooded back to cast or reaffirm their votes.

"The missile will reach Voyager in seventy-one hours. We can't stop it. But we can make sure you see our choice. Seventy-five percent chose dialogue. Chose growth. Chose to be worthy of your partnership, even if we're not yet ready for it." Marcus looked directly at the camera, knowing the Assembled might never see this, knowing he might be speaking into void. But he had to try.

"We ask for the third option. For time to grow. For provisional partnership while we continue developing. Not because we've achieved perfection, but because we've demonstrated potential. Please. Give us the chance to become what you hoped we could be."

The broadcast ended. Normal programming resumed. But the message was out—to seven billion humans and, through every radio telescope pointed at Voyager, to the Assembled.

Marcus's phone immediately exploded with calls. Kessler first.

"That was the most illegal, reckless, necessary thing I've ever seen," Kessler said. "I'm officially supposed to arrest you and Thorne for broadcast hijacking and emergency system interference."

"Are you going to?"

"After the deadline. If we survive this and fail the test, you'll face charges. If we pass, I'll claim the broadcast was part of authorized emergency communication protocols. Either way, the immediate priority is stopping that missile."

"Can you?"

"I've got assets moving. Long shot, but maybe. The faction that launched is isolated now—your broadcast exposed them, made it clear they're acting against majority will. Their military support is collapsing. But the missile's already in space and locked on target."

"Then it's up to Voyager."

"To defend itself, you mean. To demonstrate that the Assembled can destroy our weapons when threatened." Kessler's voice was grim. "That's also a test, isn't it? Whether we're mature enough to handle being the weaker party. Whether we can accept help from those more powerful without seeing it as domination."

"I guess we're about to find out."

Marcus ended the call and looked at his team. Yuki was monitoring the missile trajectory. Sofia was coordinating responses with their global network. Dr. Rashid was compiling the final referendum data. Professor Okafor was preparing documentation of everything they'd achieved.

"Seventy-five point four percent," Yuki reported. "Still climbing. The broadcast triggered another surge—people who'd been undecided are voting yes in solidarity against the rogue launch."

"How high can we go?" Sofia asked.

"Projecting seventy-six, maybe seventy-seven percent by the time Voyager arrives. We're not going to hit eighty-five. But we've demonstrated the third option. We've shown growth potential. Whether that's enough..." She didn't finish.

Marcus pulled up the view from the Hubble telescope. Voyager was visible now, a bright point growing larger each hour. In three days it would reach Earth orbit. And in seventy-one hours, a kinetic interceptor would reach it first.

Unless it didn't.

"We've done everything we can," he said. "We found the pattern, built the consensus, demonstrated growth. Now we wait to see if it was enough."

"And if Voyager destroys the missile?" Dr. Rashid asked. "If the Assembled use force to protect their vessel?"

"Then we learn that wisdom includes self-defense," Marcus said. "That the Assembled aren't pacifists. Just... selective about when violence is necessary."

His phone chimed. Message from an unknown number.

*The proof is complete. Yuki was right—we're brilliant AND lucky. The mathematics work. Humanity deserves the third option. - ET*

Marcus showed it to Yuki.

"She's giving credit where it's due," Yuki said softly. "The mentor I remember would have done that. Maybe she's really finding her way back."

"We all are," Sofia said. "Finding our way. Growing. Showing potential. That's what the test was always about."

The countdown continued. Seventy-one hours until impact. Seventy-two hours until Voyager arrived. Seventy-five point six percent consensus and rising.

All of it coming down to three days.

Three days to discover if humanity's growth potential was enough.

Three days to learn if wisdom could overcome violence.

Three days until first contact or permanent isolation.

Marcus looked at the brilliant point of light growing brighter in the telescope view and thought about the message they'd sent. Not perfect, not unified, but trying. Growing. Demonstrating potential.

And he hoped—desperately, irrationally, but genuinely hoped—that potential was what the Assembled had been looking for all along.

"Three days," he said. "Let's make them count."
