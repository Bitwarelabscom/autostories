# Chapter 26: First Blood

The notification came at 4:17 AM Geneva time. Marcus was still awake, monitoring protest feeds from across the globe, when his tablet lit up with an emergency alert from the commission's crisis center.

*CRITICAL INCIDENT - LAGOS - MULTIPLE CASUALTIES - ALL SENIOR STAFF REPORT IMMEDIATELY*

He was dressed and out the door in three minutes, arriving at the crisis center to find it already crowded with grim-faced officials. The main screen showed aerial footage from Lagos, Nigeria—a massive intersection where two demonstrations had collided. Emergency lights strobed through the darkness. Bodies lay motionless on the pavement.

"What happened?" Marcus asked.

Kessler's voice was flat, drained of emotion. "A pro-contact march and an anti-contact march converged at the same intersection. Someone threw an incendiary device. The crowd panicked. Stampede. Then fighting. Then..."

He gestured at the screen. The aerial view pulled back, showing the full scope. Hundreds injured. And seventeen bodies covered with sheets, waiting for coroners.

"Seventeen dead," Ambassador Chen said quietly. "Twelve in the stampede, five from direct violence. The youngest was fourteen years old. A girl who'd come with her school group to march for contact."

Marcus felt his stomach lurch. A fourteen-year-old, killed for supporting a choice she'd probably barely understood. For wanting to believe humanity could reach for something beyond itself.

"Who started it?" Sofia's voice came from the doorway. She looked haggard, her arm still bandaged from Mexico City.

"Does it matter?" Yuki was at her workstation, pulling up forensic analysis. "Pro and anti-contact groups blame each other. Security footage shows the incendiary came from someone masked, affiliation unknown. Could be either side, could be an agitator trying to escalate conflict."

"It matters for the narrative," Kessler said. "If this becomes a he-said-she-said between factions, it delegitimizes both movements."

"Seventeen people are dead," Sofia said, her voice dangerous. "And you're worried about narrative?"

"I'm worried about preventing the next seventeen deaths. Which requires understanding how this happened and ensuring it doesn't happen again."

"It will happen again. We've mobilized billions of people around an existential choice with a deadline. Violence is inevitable."

"Then we demobilize," Kessler said. "Ban demonstrations. Restrict protest activities. Move the referendum entirely to digital platforms where physical confrontation is impossible."

"That's authoritarian suppression," Marcus said. "The opposite of democratic legitimacy."

"It's riot control," Kessler countered. "Standard protocol when public assemblies turn violent. We can't let the referendum process devolve into tribal warfare."

"We also can't suppress legitimate political expression because it makes us uncomfortable. The Assembled asked for democratic processes. That includes the right to assemble and protest."

Kessler turned to face him fully. "Dr. Reid, we have seventeen dead bodies in Lagos. How many more corpses do we need before you accept that some rights need temporary restriction for public safety?"

Before Marcus could answer, another alert lit up the screens. Delhi. A pro-contact demonstration outside the Indian Parliament had turned violent after counter-protesters attacked with improvised weapons. Eight more deaths confirmed, dozens critically injured.

Then another alert. São Paulo. Anti-contact extremists had detonated a bomb near a Prometheus education center, killing four staff members and eleven civilians who'd been attending an information session about the Assembled's offer.

The room went silent except for the incoming emergency notifications, each one announcing more death, more violence, more proof that humanity's attempt to reach consensus was tearing itself apart.

"Shut it down," Ambassador Chen said finally. "All of it. Issue a global moratorium on referendum-related demonstrations. Move everything to regulated digital engagement only."

"You can't do that," Sofia protested. "You have no authority to ban peaceful assembly—"

"This isn't peaceful assembly. This is coordinated violence masquerading as political expression. The commission has emergency powers to ensure the referendum process remains viable. I'm invoking them."

"I oppose this," Marcus said. "Suppressing demonstrations will only drive the conflict underground, make it less visible but more dangerous."

"Noted. But the decision is made." Chen turned to her staff. "Draft the emergency order. Coordinate with national governments on enforcement protocols. And get me casualty estimates for every major demonstration site globally. I want to know the full scope of what we're dealing with."

The staff moved to comply. Marcus stood frozen, watching his worst fears manifest in real-time. They were barely past the quarter mark of the timeline, and the referendum was already producing body counts.

Yuki approached quietly. "Marcus. There's something else you need to see."

She led him to her workstation and pulled up data analysis that made his blood run cold.

"Consensus is dropping. It started about six hours ago, just after the Lagos incident hit global news. We're down to 49%. Five percentage points in six hours."

"That's not possible. Consensus doesn't swing that fast without coordinated manipulation."

"It's not manipulation. It's genuine response to violence. People are pulling back support for contact because they're seeing what the process costs. Parents don't want their kids dying in demonstrations. Religious leaders are calling the referendum 'cursed by God.' Governments that were neutral are now advising their citizens to oppose contact on safety grounds."

Marcus looked at the trending data. 54% to 49% in six hours. If that rate continued, they'd be below 40% by the end of the week.

The demonstrations hadn't built consensus. They'd destroyed it.

"We need to make a statement," Marcus said. "Address the violence directly, reaffirm the importance of peaceful engagement, call for both sides to de-escalate."

"From who?" Yuki asked. "The commission? We're seen as compromised. The scientific community? We're seen as biased toward contact. The governments? They're seen as self-interested. There's no trusted voice left."

She was right. The referendum had polarized every institution, every spokesperson, every source of authority. Anyone who spoke would be dismissed by half their audience as partisan.

"Then we speak anyway," Marcus said. "Because silence in the face of death is complicity."

---

They assembled in one of the commission's press rooms—Marcus, Sofia, Yuki, and Dr. Rashid, who'd flown in from Chile specifically for this moment. No governments, no corporations, no official positions. Just four scientists who'd started this by discovering and decoding Voyager's signal.

The statement was simple:

*We are heartbroken by the violence that has taken innocent lives. We never intended for the quest for consensus to produce conflict, or for hope to generate hatred. We call on everyone—supporters and opponents of contact alike—to honor the dead by choosing peace. This choice before humanity is too important to be decided through violence. We ask that you make your voice heard through your vote, not through confrontation.*

*The Assembled are watching. They will judge humanity not only by our final decision but by how we make it. If we cannot discuss this choice without killing each other, we have already failed the test.*

*Please. Choose peace. Choose dialogue. Choose to show that humanity is worthy of the partnership being offered.*

They released it simultaneously across every platform, then braced for the response.

It came in waves. Half the internet praised them for speaking out. Half condemned them for various sins—being too soft, too naive, too willing to blame both sides when clearly one side was the aggressor (though which side was the aggressor depended on the accuser's perspective).

The violence didn't stop.

Over the next forty-eight hours, twelve more deaths across six countries. The emergency moratorium on demonstrations was implemented unevenly—some governments enforced it strictly, others ignored it, a few used it as excuse to suppress all political dissent, not just referendum-related protests.

The consensus number continued dropping. 49% to 44% to 39%.

Three months of work, billions spent, global coordination—erased in three days of violence and fear.

Marcus sat in his office, watching the numbers fall, and felt the weight of responsibility crushing him. They'd discovered the signal. They'd decoded the message. They'd made the choice public. And now people were dying because of decisions he'd set in motion.

Sofia found him there, staring at his tablet's consensus tracker.

"It's not your fault," she said.

"Isn't it? We pushed for transparency. We pushed for democratic engagement. We created the conditions that led to this."

"The conditions were already there. Humanity was already divided, already violent, already prone to tribalism. We just made it impossible to ignore."

"That doesn't make the deaths less real."

"No. But it makes them meaningful. Those people died believing in something. Fighting for what they thought was right. That's not nothing."

Marcus looked at her. "A fourteen-year-old girl is dead, Sofia. She should be in school, learning algebra and arguing with her friends about music, not lying under a sheet in Lagos because some asshole threw a firebomb at a demonstration."

"I know." Sofia's voice broke slightly. "I know, and it's awful, and I wish it hadn't happened. But we can't let their deaths be for nothing. We have to keep pushing for consensus, keep working toward the 85%, keep believing that humanity can pass this test."

"We're at 39%. We've lost fifteen percentage points in three days. The test isn't just impossible now—it's trending in the wrong direction."

"Then we change tactics. Find a new approach. But we don't quit."

"Maybe we should. Maybe the ethical thing is to accept that humanity isn't ready for this choice, let the Assembled leave, and stop getting people killed trying to force a consensus that doesn't exist."

Sofia grabbed his shoulders, forcing him to meet her eyes. "Listen to me. Those seventeen people in Lagos? The eight in Delhi? The fifteen in São Paulo? They didn't die for nothing unless we give up. They died fighting for a future where humanity reaches beyond its limits, where we prove we're capable of unity despite our divisions. If we quit now, we're saying their sacrifice was meaningless. I won't do that. And neither will you."

Marcus wanted to argue, but he was too tired. Too sad. Too overwhelmed by the magnitude of what they'd attempted and how badly it was failing.

A notification popped up on his tablet. New signal from Voyager.

"Yuki needs us," he said quietly. "Another message."

They found Yuki in the decryption center, her face pale as she stared at the decoded transmission.

"What is it?" Marcus asked.

"A response. To the violence. The Assembled have been watching everything, and they've sent..."

She turned the screen so they could read it.

*VIOLENCE IN PURSUIT OF UNITY IS CONTRADICTION*

*CASUALTIES IN PROCESS OF CONSENSUS INDICATE FAILURE OF PREREQUISITES*

*EVALUATION CRITERIA EXPAND: INTELLIGENCE + UNITY + ETHICS*

*CURRENT ASSESSMENT: INTELLIGENCE DEMONSTRATED*

*UNITY: INSUFFICIENT*

*ETHICS: CONCERNING*

*TIME REMAINING: 8 MONTHS 23 DAYS*

*CHOICE STILL OFFERED - UNDERSTANDING NOW CLARIFIED*

The room went silent.

"Ethics," Marcus said finally. "They're judging our ethics. How we achieve consensus, not just whether we achieve it."

"Which means the violence doesn't just reduce our consensus numbers," Yuki said. "It fails the ethics test. Every death, every injury, every act of hatred—they're watching all of it."

Sofia sat down heavily. "Then we've already failed. How do we get eight billion people to agree on something without any conflict? It's impossible."

"Maybe not impossible," Yuki said slowly. "But definitely harder than we thought. The Assembled aren't asking for zero violence—they said 'concerning,' not 'failed.' They're still offering the choice. But they've clarified that violence in pursuit of consensus is disqualifying."

"So we need 85% consensus achieved through entirely peaceful means," Marcus said. "In eight months and twenty-three days. Starting from 39%."

"With a global population that just killed thirty-nine people arguing about the question," Sofia added.

They looked at each other, the impossible mathematics of the situation settling over them like a shroud.

"We should tell the commission," Yuki said.

"We should tell everyone," Marcus corrected. "Full transparency. The Assembled just moved the goalposts. Humanity deserves to know."

---

Within hours, the new message was public. The response was immediate and divided.

Half saw it as confirmation that peaceful engagement was necessary. Half saw it as impossible constraint, proof that the test was rigged to ensure failure.

But something unexpected happened. The violence didn't escalate. It paused.

Because now everyone knew the aliens were watching. Judging. Evaluating not just the outcome but the process.

It didn't stop the protests. But it changed them. Made them more careful. More conscious that every act of hatred was being recorded by observers who could grant or deny humanity's future.

The consensus numbers stopped falling. 39%. Stable. Not rising yet, but no longer in free fall.

Marcus watched the new equilibrium establish itself and felt cautiously hopeful for the first time in days.

They'd lost thirty-nine people. They'd learned that the test included ethics. They'd crashed from 54% to 39%.

But they had eight months. Eight months to build peaceful consensus across a divided world. To prove humanity could want something together without destroying itself in the process.

It was still impossible.

But at least now they understood what impossible actually meant.
