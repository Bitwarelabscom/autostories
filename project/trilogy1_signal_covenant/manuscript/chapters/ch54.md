# Chapter 54: The Threshold

Thirty-six hours after Thorne's announcement, the referendum crossed seventy-four percent.

The world watched in real-time as the numbers climbed: 74.1%, 74.2%, 74.3%...

One percentage point from the threshold. One point from demonstrating humanity had enough potential for provisional partnership.

But the acceleration was slowing.

"We're hitting saturation," Yuki reported, analyzing participation curves. "We've reached ninety-two percent of accessible populations. The final point is going to be the hardest."

Marcus pulled up demographic breakdowns. The remaining non-participants fell into three categories: truly inaccessible (populations without any referendum infrastructure), active abstainers (people who'd chosen not to participate), and the persuadable undecided (people who could still be mobilized).

The persuadable undecided were maybe two hundred million people. If they could convert sixty percent of them to yes votes, they'd reach seventy-five percent.

"Eight days until Voyager arrives," Sofia said. "One percentage point. Can we do it?"

"We have to," Dr. Rashid said simply.

The final mobilization campaign was everything at once—grassroots organizing, media saturation, personal appeals, celebrity endorsements, religious leader statements, governmental encouragements. Every tool, every channel, every voice trying to reach those final holdouts.

And slowly, incrementally, it worked.

74.4%
74.5%
74.6%

Each tenth of a percentage point took hours, then half a day, then longer. The curve was flattening despite maximum effort.

"We're going to plateau below seventy-five," Yuki said, reading the trend lines. "We'll hit seventy-four point eight, maybe seventy-four point nine. But that last tenth..."

Marcus thought about all the thresholds he'd faced. Grad school acceptance. Dissertation defense. Job interviews. Pattern recognition tests. So many times he'd been just short. Just not quite enough.

Was this another one?

His phone rang. Sofia's brother's friend, Roberto, from Santiago.

"Dr. Reid? I voted no originally. I still think the sovereignty concerns are valid. But I'm changing my vote to yes. Not because I stopped worrying. Because I'd rather we try and fail than not try at all. Thought you should know."

One vote. One person changing their mind. It would barely register in the billions participating.

But it mattered.

Marcus pulled up the stories still flooding in through #WhyIChose. Thousands of people explaining their final choices. Many undecided finally deciding. Many nos reconsidering. Many yes votes encouraging others.

This wasn't just mathematics. It was humanity wrestling with the biggest choice we'd ever faced, and slowly—painfully slowly—finding our answer.

74.7%
74.8%
74.9%

"We're one-tenth of a percentage point away," Sofia whispered. "About twenty million votes."

The numbers hung at 74.9% for three hours. Everyone working every channel, mobilizing every last person who might participate.

And then, at 4:47 PM Geneva time, six days before Voyager's arrival:

75.0%

The threshold.

The room erupted. Yuki was crying. Sofia was hugging Dr. Rashid. Marcus stood watching the numbers, barely able to process it.

They'd done it. Humanity had demonstrated enough potential for provisional partnership. Enough wisdom to find the hidden option. Enough unity to reach three-quarters consensus despite all their divisions.

Not perfect. Not complete. But enough.

The number kept climbing—74.9% had been sustained too long, and now the momentum pushed past:

75.1%
75.2%
75.3%

"We're not stopping," Yuki said, watching the acceleration. "Look at the velocity. People are flooding in now that we've reached the threshold. We might hit seventy-six, seventy-seven..."

Marcus pulled up analysis. She was right. The successful crossing of seventy-five percent was triggering another surge. People who'd been watching, waiting to see if humanity could actually do it, were now participating because success seemed possible.

The test wasn't over. They still had six days, still could build higher consensus. But they'd crossed the critical threshold. They'd proven capacity for growth.

His phone exploded with messages. Director Chen from Atacama. General Reeves. Sarah Chen. Even a brief message from Kessler's lawyer saying his client would be proud.

And one from Thorne: *You did it. All of you. Not me, not corporations, not governments. People choosing honestly. Exactly what the test required. Congratulations.*

Marcus looked at his team—Sofia organizing, Yuki analyzing, Dr. Rashid coordinating, volunteers worldwide mobilizing. They'd built this together. Not through manipulation or force, but through transparency and trust.

Six days until Voyager arrived.

75.3% and climbing.

The test wasn't over.

But humanity had passed the threshold.

And that changed everything.
