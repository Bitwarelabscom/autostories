# Chapter 28: Fractured Alliance

Kessler's message was terse: *My office. One hour. Come alone.*

Thorne knew exactly what it was about. The leaked mission specs for her Voyager intercept had reached him, just as she'd anticipated. The only question was whether he'd try to stop her or demand a partnership stake.

She arrived at the NAU Space Intelligence Agency's Geneva office precisely on time. Kessler's assistant—a stone-faced woman who looked like she ate glass for breakfast—escorted her through three security checkpoints to a conference room that was certainly being recorded from multiple angles.

Kessler was waiting, and he was not alone. Ambassador Chen sat at the table, along with General Morrison from NAU military command and Dr. Elena Volkov, Russia's representative to the verification commission.

"Director. I wasn't aware this would be a party," Thorne said, maintaining her composure.

"Sit down, Ms. Thorne." Kessler's voice could have frozen helium.

She sat, carefully neutral. Whatever play this was, she wouldn't give them the satisfaction of seeing her rattled.

Kessler slid a tablet across the table. It showed the Project Covenant specifications—her spacecraft design, mission timeline, crew manifest. Everything Marcus had leaked to him.

"Explain this."

"It's a contingency mission. In case the referendum fails to achieve 85% consensus, humanity will still have access to some alien technology from Voyager for study and potential—"

"It's sabotage," Kessler interrupted. "Sabotage of the entire referendum process. If you intercept Voyager before it reaches Earth, you undermine the very test the Assembled are conducting. Every nation will see it as a corporate power grab. The coalition we've built will collapse. Consensus becomes impossible."

"We're already at 39% consensus, Director. After three months of work and thirty-nine deaths, we're further from passing than when we started. This isn't sabotage. It's insurance against predictable failure."

"Predictable because you're engineering it!" Ambassador Chen's voice was sharp. "Your intervention campaign has been spending billions to shape public opinion in red zones. Now we discover you've also been building a spacecraft to bypass the test entirely. You've been hedging against your own strategy."

"I've been realistic about our chances." Thorne met Chen's glare without flinching. "The intervention campaign was meant to build genuine consensus if possible. The Voyager mission is backup if consensus proves impossible. They're not contradictory—they're parallel paths to the same goal."

"The same goal being Prometheus Industries' monopoly on alien technology," General Morrison said. "Don't insult our intelligence with talk of helping humanity. This is about corporate advantage, pure and simple."

Thorne laughed. Not her polite corporate laugh, but something genuine and slightly bitter. "General, if this were about profit, I'd have licensed the voting infrastructure to governments at markup and skipped the spacecraft entirely. Do you know what Project Covenant costs? Eleven billion dollars. For a mission that might—might—retrieve some alien-modified components from a forty-year-old probe. The ROI is catastrophically negative unless we actually pass the test and establish broader partnership with the Assembled. This isn't about profit. It's about ensuring humanity doesn't walk away from this opportunity with nothing."

"By stealing what we can't earn honestly," Kessler said. "Evelyn, we've worked together for months. I thought I understood your motives. But this..." He gestured at the specifications. "This is theft. Piracy. The kind of aggressive nationalism we've been trying to move beyond."

"It's pragmatism. Something you used to value before you started believing your own rhetoric about democratic legitimacy."

"Careful," Kessler warned.

"Or what? You'll expose the mission publicly?" Thorne leaned forward. "Director, think carefully about that choice. If you blow the whistle on Project Covenant, you don't just damage Prometheus. You damage the entire corporate partnership that's been funding the referendum infrastructure. The education campaigns. The verification systems. Twelve billion in support that evaporates the moment you make me a villain. Can the referendum survive that?"

"Is that a threat?"

"It's a calculation. The same kind you've been making since this started. We both want humanity to pass this test. We both recognize that achieving 85% consensus through entirely peaceful democratic means is borderline impossible. So we've both been taking out insurance. You through managed intervention campaigns that shape opinion. Me through a physical mission that secures technology. Don't pretend your hands are cleaner than mine."

The room went silent. Thorne could see she'd struck a nerve. Kessler's intervention campaign had crossed ethical lines—targeted manipulation of vulnerable populations, coordination with authoritarian governments willing to deliver votes in exchange for concessions, statistical modeling that identified and exploited psychological vulnerabilities. He'd justified it as necessary. Now he was condemning her for the same pragmatism.

"There's a difference," Ambassador Chen said quietly, "between intervening to help people make informed choices and unilaterally seizing alien property for corporate advantage."

"Is there? Because from where I sit, both involve powerful actors deciding they know better than democratic processes and taking unilateral action to ensure preferred outcomes. The only difference is I'm being honest about it."

"You're being honest now because you were caught," Kessler said. "How long were you planning to keep this secret?"

"Until the referendum was decided. If we achieved 85% consensus, I would have scrapped the mission—no need for insurance if we passed the test. If we failed to achieve consensus, I would have launched. Either way, humanity would have benefited."

"Humanity. Not Prometheus Industries."

"They're not mutually exclusive. Yes, Prometheus would have had first access to the technology we retrieved. That access would have been worth trillions. But we would have shared the knowledge. Published the research. Created an open-source foundation for the discoveries. I'm not a cartoon villain, Director. I'm a scientist who became a CEO to fund science. This mission is about knowledge, not conquest."

"I don't believe you," Kessler said flatly.

Thorne felt something crack inside her—some last remnant of hope that her former partners would understand her motives. "Then we have nothing further to discuss. Do what you think you must. Expose the mission, destroy our partnership, fracture the coalition. But know that when the referendum fails and humanity is left with nothing to show for this opportunity, you'll share the responsibility."

She stood to leave.

"Sit down." Kessler's command voice. "We're not done."

"Actually, Director, we are. Unless you're planning to arrest me—which you lack authority to do—I'm leaving."

"I can revoke Prometheus's contracts. Freeze your assets. Ground your spacecraft through international space law enforcement."

"You can try. It would take months of legal proceedings, assuming you could even establish jurisdiction. Project Covenant launches in five weeks. By the time you navigate the bureaucracy, it will be irrelevant."

General Morrison spoke up. "We could shoot it down. NAU has assets capable of destroying your spacecraft before it reaches Voyager."

The room temperature dropped ten degrees. Thorne looked at Morrison with genuine shock. "You're threatening to militarily attack a civilian spacecraft conducting scientific research?"

"I'm stating capabilities. Whether we use them depends on whether you're willing to call off this mission."

"I'm not."

"Then you force our hand."

Thorne turned to Kessler. "Director, tell your general to stand down. Destroying a spacecraft doesn't just violate a dozen international treaties—it proves to the Assembled that humanity solves disagreements through violence. It fails the ethics test definitively."

"So does corporate theft of alien property," Kessler said. But his voice was less certain now.

Ambassador Chen intervened. "Perhaps there's a middle ground. Ms. Thorne, what if we nationalized Project Covenant? Brought it under international oversight, made it an official contingency plan rather than a corporate mission?"

"Absolutely not. The moment you involve governments, it becomes political. Negotiations over crew selection, mission authority, distribution of discoveries—it would take years to sort out. The mission window is five weeks."

"Then delay the launch. Give us time to properly coordinate."

"Voyager will be at Earth in seven months. If we wait, we lose the intercept window. It's now or never."

Dr. Volkov, who'd been silent until now, finally spoke. Her accent was thick but her English precise. "Ms. Thorne, I have reviewed your mission specifications. The spacecraft is remarkable. The crew is qualified. The mission profile is sound. If this were being conducted by a government space agency, I would call it admirable scientific initiative. But it is not government. It is corporate. And that makes it colonialism dressed as exploration."

"Dr. Volkov, with respect, Russia attempted its own Voyager intercept mission two months ago. Your spacecraft failed during launch. Don't lecture me about colonialism when your government tried the exact same thing."

Volkov's expression didn't change. "And we were rightly criticized for that attempt. Our failure was fortunate—it prevented further damage to international cooperation. Your success would be catastrophic precisely because it would work. You would retrieve alien technology. You would study it privately. You would patent the discoveries. And humanity would be divided between those with access and those without. The Assembled test unity. You create division."

Thorne had no good answer for that. Because Volkov was right. If Project Covenant succeeded, it would create exactly the kind of technological inequality that would make 85% consensus impossible to maintain.

Unless they failed the test first, in which case inequality was irrelevant because there would be no partnership to maintain.

"Director Kessler," Thorne said carefully. "You haven't said whether you'll expose the mission publicly. That's the real question here. These threats about freezing assets and shooting down spacecraft—they're negotiating positions. What do you actually want?"

Kessler was quiet for a long moment. Then: "I want you to abort the mission. Commit those eleven billion dollars to the referendum process instead. Prove that Prometheus Industries cares more about humanity passing the test than about corporate advantage."

"And if I refuse?"

"Then I make the mission public. Let the global community decide whether to allow it. If they support it, you launch with international blessing. If they oppose it, you face sanctions, asset freezes, and possible military intervention. Either way, the decision is democratized rather than unilateral."

Thorne considered this. Making the mission public would certainly destroy consensus—probably drop it from 39% to 25% as nations fractured over whether to support or oppose the intercept. The referendum would fail. But Project Covenant would likely be allowed to proceed—no government would risk the appearance of suppressing scientific initiative, and enough nations would quietly support the mission to prevent coordinated opposition.

So Kessler's ultimatum was essentially: abort the mission to save the referendum, or keep the mission and accept that the referendum fails.

"You're asking me to choose between two paths to the same goal," Thorne said. "Referendum or intercept. Both aimed at ensuring humanity gets access to alien knowledge. Why should I abandon the intercept when it has better odds of success?"

"Because the intercept doesn't actually pass the test," Kessler said. "At best, it retrieves some modified components from Voyager. We study them, reverse-engineer what we can, maybe make some advances. But we don't get partnership with the Assembled. We don't get the technology transfer, the knowledge sharing, the invitation to join seventeen advanced civilizations. We get scraps and isolation. Is that really success?"

"It's better than getting nothing, which is where we're headed at 39% consensus with eight months left."

"Only if you believe the referendum can't work. I still believe it can."

Thorne laughed again, that bitter sound. "Director, we've worked together long enough that I know you don't actually believe that. You're a realist. You've seen the numbers, the violence, the entrenched opposition. You know 85% is impossible. The difference between us is I'm willing to admit it and take the backup plan seriously."

"The difference between us," Kessler said coldly, "is I'm willing to fail honestly rather than cheat my way to a consolation prize."

The words hit harder than Thorne expected. Not because they were unfair, but because they were true.

She stood again. This time no one stopped her.

"Make your decision, Director. Expose the mission or don't. But make it soon. Project Covenant launches in five weeks, and nothing you say in this room will stop that countdown."

She left, maintaining her composure until she reached her car. Then she sat in the privacy of the backseat and let herself acknowledge the truth.

Kessler would expose the mission. Not immediately—he'd coordinate with other commission members first, build support for opposition, time the revelation for maximum impact. But he would do it.

And when he did, the referendum would collapse. Consensus would plummet. The test would fail.

But Project Covenant would launch. And Thorne would ensure that humanity got something from this opportunity, even if she had to steal it.

The car drove through Geneva's evening streets. Somewhere above, Voyager continued its approach. And somewhere ahead, a decision point was approaching where humanity would have to choose: genuine consensus or stolen advantage.

Thorne had already made her choice.

The question was whether the rest of humanity would forgive her for it.
