      "Deep space hauler crews: small (4-6 people), isolated for years, semi-independent contractors",
      "Corporate salvage rights: finding derelict ships is extremely valuable, crews get percentage of value",

  "tone": "Cold, clinical horror building to existential dread. The terror is intellectual before it becomes visceral. Silence and isolation punctuated by the mechanical perfection of systems that should have failed centuries ago."
