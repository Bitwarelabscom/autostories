# World Rules - Malmö AI Crime

## Immutable Laws

### Technology Rules
1. **No magic AI**: All AI is narrow, specialized ML models. They do pattern matching, not reasoning.
2. **Everything is exploitable**: No unhackable systems. Security is implementation-dependent.
3. **Adversarial attacks work**: If you can access training data or model behavior, you can fool the system.
4. **Data exhaust is real**: Every smart system generates behavioral patterns that can be exploited.
5. **Legacy systems persist**: Old infrastructure runs alongside new. This creates vulnerabilities.

### Investigation Rules
1. **Physical evidence matters**: Even in algorithmic crimes, there are phones, containers, hardware.
2. **Logs can be faked**: Digital evidence is circumstantial without corroboration.
3. **Models leave traces**: ML training creates artifacts that forensics can find.
4. **Jurisdiction is messy**: Multiple agencies with overlapping authority and turf wars.
5. **Proof of intent is hard**: When algorithms make decisions, establishing criminal intent is difficult.

### Social Rules
1. **Class determines vulnerability**: Rich have privacy tools. Poor have surveillance.
2. **Immigrant communities are marginalized**: But younger generation is tech-native and resourceful.
3. **Police are professional but stretched**: Competent, not corrupt, but understaffed for cyber work.
4. **Service workers are information-rich**: Cleaners, delivery drivers, maintenance see everything.
5. **Sweden is not a utopia**: Social democracy is eroding under surveillance capitalism.

### Crime Rules
1. **Traditional crime uses new tools**: Smugglers use adversarial ML, not just boats.
2. **New criminal class emerges**: Algorithm brokers, model trainers, data thieves.
3. **Dark markets for models**: You can buy trained ML models like you'd buy drugs.
4. **Crimes must be explainable**: Reader should understand how the exploit works.
5. **No omniscient criminals**: They make mistakes. Systems have edge cases they miss.

## Enforcement Notes

- All technical elements must be plausible with 2027 technology
- No deus ex machina through tech - solutions come from human insight
- Swedish cultural norms apply: consensus, conflict-avoidant, professional
- Malmö-specific geography must be accurate (real neighborhoods, harbor layout)
- All AI crimes must be based on real attack vectors (adversarial ML, model inversion, etc.)
