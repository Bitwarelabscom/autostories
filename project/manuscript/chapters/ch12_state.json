But also the most determined - Sara and Emil find purpose in systemic understanding instead of tactical wins. Katarina is sympathetic in a way that makes the moral complexity uncomfortable. No easy answers, no clean victories. The reversal is both breakthrough (they understand now) and despair (understanding shows how big and unfixable it is). Nordic noir realism - competent people facing impossible odds and choosing to try anyway.",
  "reversal_impact": "MIDPOINT REVERSAL: Sara and Emil shift from hunting individual criminals to understanding systemic problems. They realize police are part of the exploitable infrastructure, not outside it. The story shifts from 'catch the bad guys' to 'expose and understand the system that creates algorithmic crime.' Characters accept they're outmatched but find new purpose in documentation and systemic change. Changes the stakes from tactical (solve these cases) to strategic (change how society handles data, labor, and surveillance)."
