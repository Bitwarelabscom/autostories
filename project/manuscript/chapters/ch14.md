# Chapter 14: Convergence

Emil had been staring at code for six hours straight. His coffee had gone cold three times, reheated twice, and finally been abandoned.

On his center monitor, lines of Python scrolled past. Adversary's tutorial code from the forums. On the left monitor, decompiled bytecode from the phone found at one of the pharmacy robberies. On the right, the model architecture diagrams Adversary had posted.

He was looking for matches. Not exact copies—that would be too obvious—but patterns. The way a programmer structures their code is as distinctive as handwriting.

"There," he muttered, highlighting a function. The variable naming convention was unusual: descriptive but abbreviated in a specific way. `sec_sys` instead of `security_system`. `temp_patt` instead of `temporal_pattern`. Consistent across both the tutorial code and the pharmacy exploit.

He pulled up another file. More matches. The comment style—minimal but precise, explaining the why rather than the what. The preference for list comprehensions over loops. The habit of validating inputs at the start of every function.

Small things. Individually, nothing. Together, a signature.

Emil created a new document and started building a technical profile:

**Coding patterns:**
- Pythonic style (not translated from another language)
- Security-conscious (input validation, error handling)
- Comments explain intent, not implementation
- Preference for functional programming patterns
- Knowledge of production best practices

Someone who'd worked in a real development environment, not just academic projects. Someone who'd passed code reviews and learned to write for other people to read.

He cross-referenced the pharmacy robbery locations on a map. Six pharmacies across five neighborhoods: Rosengård, Lindängen, Värnhem, Möllevången, Sofielund. All working-class areas, all with immigrant populations, all served by the same security company.

The timing pattern was precise. Each robbery occurred within a five-minute window when the security cameras rebooted for automated updates. That schedule wasn't public information. You'd have to reverse-engineer the security system's behavior or social-engineer someone with inside knowledge.

Emil pulled up the security company's customer list. Thirty-two businesses in Malmö used their smart security system. Why these six pharmacies specifically?

He mapped them again, this time overlaying public transit routes.

All six were within two stops of Rosengård Centrum.

Emil sat back. Rosengård. Katarina had said Adversary used urban street metaphors, spoke like someone from the neighborhoods. The pharmacy targets weren't random—they were local. Convenient. Someone who knew these areas personally.

He opened the forum data again and ran a geographic analysis on the references Adversary had made. Mentions of the Öresund bridge traffic patterns. Discussion of Malmö's transit scheduling algorithms. A comment about the Turning Torso being "visible from the poor neighborhoods like a middle finger."

Local. Definitely local. And someone with class resentment.

Emil started a new search: recent computer science graduates from Malmö University and Lund University. Cross-referenced with Rosengård addresses. The list was longer than he expected—forty-three people in the last five years.

He needed to narrow it down further.

Sara stood on Beijerskajen, the pedestrian street that ran through Rosengård's center, and tried to look less like a police detective.

She'd left her usual professional clothing at home—no blazer, no badge visible. Jeans, a winter coat, running shoes. Trying to blend in with the afternoon shopping crowd.

It wasn't working. She was too old, too Swedish, too obviously not from here. People's eyes slid past her, marking her as outsider.

The neighborhood looked tired in the December gray. Concrete apartment blocks from the 1970s, practical and worn. Satellite dishes clustered on balconies. Signs in Arabic, Somali, Persian. The Rosengård Centrum mall had been renovated recently—bright and modern—but the surrounding buildings still carried decades of neglect.

Sara had done her research. Rosengård was forty percent unemployment, eighty percent immigrant background, and constantly in the news for crime statistics and integration failures. It was also home to thirty thousand people who were mostly just trying to live their lives.

She'd come here to understand. If Adversary was from this neighborhood, if they'd grown up watching talented people get tracked into dead-end futures, she needed to see it through their eyes.

A community center caught her attention. New construction next to an old building, lots of glass and solar panels. A sign in multiple languages: "Rosengård Technology Hub - Free Computer Access & Training."

Sara pushed through the door.

Inside was warmth and noise. Teenagers clustered around computers, gaming and laughing. An older woman sat at a terminal practicing Swedish grammar exercises. In a corner room with glass walls, someone was teaching a coding class—ten students, all young, all focused on their screens.

A staff member approached—a young man in his twenties, wearing a hoodie and the patient smile of someone who answered the same questions constantly.

"Can I help you?"

"Just looking," Sara said. "I heard you offer tech training?"

"Computer literacy, coding classes, job skills. All free." He gestured around. "We get funding from the municipality and some tech companies. Try to give people access to opportunities they wouldn't get otherwise."

"Like what?"

"Programming, data analysis, IT certifications. Most of our students can't afford university, or they're already working and trying to level up their skills." He shrugged. "Not everyone gets the same starting position, you know? We try to even it out a little."

Sara nodded. "Do you know much about machine learning? AI?"

"Some. We've got a few instructors who teach it. Mostly self-taught people from the neighborhood who wanted to give back." He studied her more carefully. "You looking to learn, or looking for someone?"

Direct. Sara appreciated that.

"Both, maybe. I'm trying to understand how people from here get into tech when the usual paths are closed."

"You a journalist?"

"Something like that."

He didn't believe her, but he answered anyway. "Same as anyone. Online tutorials, practice, build a portfolio, apply for jobs. Except our people apply for a hundred positions and get ten interviews and one offer if they're lucky. Meanwhile, some kid from Limhamn with the same resume gets twenty interviews and five offers." He wasn't angry, just matter-of-fact. "The algorithms that screen resumes, they learn from historical data. Historical data says people from Rosengård don't succeed in tech jobs. So the algorithm filters them out. Self-fulfilling prophecy."

"What do people do when that happens?"

"Most give up, take whatever job they can get. Some keep trying. Some get creative."

"Creative how?"

He smiled thinly. "Find ways around the algorithms. Change their address on their resume. Use a different name. Learn to game the system back."

"And some people teach others how to do that?"

Now he was definitely suspicious. "Who are you really?"

Sara made a decision. She pulled out her police ID.

The young man's expression didn't change, but his posture shifted. Not quite defensive, but guarded.

"I'm not here to cause trouble," Sara said. "I'm investigating some algorithmic crimes. I'm trying to understand the people who commit them."

"You want me to inform on my community."

"No. I want to understand why someone brilliant enough to exploit surveillance systems chose crime instead of something else."

"Because 'something else' wasn't available." He crossed his arms. "Look, I don't know who you're hunting. But I know plenty of people who could work at tech companies, who have the skills and the drive, and who can't get past the first automated screening. You tell me what they're supposed to do with that."

"Not commit crimes."

"Easy to say when the system works for you."

Sara thought of her father, filling out job applications after the port laid him off. Fifty-three years old, twenty-five years of experience, and nobody wanted him. The shipping companies had algorithms now. They preferred younger workers, cheaper workers, workers without history.

He'd stopped trying after six months.

"You're right," Sara said. "It's not fair. The system is broken. But I still have to enforce the law."

"Then we don't have anything else to talk about." He moved to walk away.

"If someone was teaching people to exploit security systems," Sara said, "teaching them for free, with patience and care—what would you think of that person?"

He paused. "I'd think they were trying to level a playing field that was never fair to begin with."

"Even if people got hurt?"

"Did they? Or did some rich people's security systems get embarrassed?"

"Pharmacies got robbed. Those serve your neighbors."

That landed. His jaw tightened. "If that's true, then whoever did it forgot what they were fighting for."

"That happens," Sara said. "You get so focused on beating the system that you forget the system isn't abstract. It's made of people."

He looked at her for a long moment. "I don't know who you're looking for. But if they're from here, they had reasons. Doesn't make it right, but they had reasons."

"I know," Sara said. "That's why I'm here."

He nodded once and walked away.

Sara stayed in the community center for another hour, observing. She watched the coding class, listened to the instructor explain recursive functions. Watched teenagers cluster around computers, building projects and solving problems. Saw people learning, striving, trying to find their way to better futures.

Somewhere in this neighborhood, or one like it, Adversary had grown up. Had learned to code. Had faced the algorithmic barriers and decided to fight back.

Sara needed to understand them before she could catch them.

Yusuf Hassan noticed the increased police activity on Tuesday afternoon.

He was walking home from his legitimate job—eight hours of optimizing logistics routes for a shipping company, ironic given his side work—when he saw the patrol car parked outside Rosengård Centrum. Not unusual by itself. But there was also a plainclothes officer—he'd spotted enough to recognize them—walking through the pedestrian area, trying to look casual.

Yusuf kept walking, didn't change pace, didn't stare. Just noted it and moved on.

At home, in the small bedroom he used as an office, he checked his monitoring systems. He had alerts set up for any news about algorithmic crimes, any forum discussions about arrests, any patterns in police activity.

Three hits in the last two days.

A cleaning company manager arrested for apartment burglaries. Using smart building data and machine learning. The news article was thin on details, but the methodology described was familiar. One of his students, probably. Someone who'd taken the tutorials and implemented them.

He felt a twinge of something. Not quite guilt. Concern, maybe. He'd taught people to understand systems, to recognize their vulnerabilities. What they did with that knowledge afterward...

He'd told himself it wasn't his responsibility. He was just a teacher. An educator.

But teachers shaped what their students became. He knew that.

Yusuf pulled up the encrypted forums, connecting through Tor. His usual precautions—VPN, then Tor, then another layer of encryption. His threat model had always assumed law enforcement would eventually pay attention.

The thread about Katarina Ek's arrest had ninety-three replies. People were nervous. Some were asking if they should shut down operations, delete evidence, go dark.

Yusuf posted, using his Adversary account:

*Stay calm. Practice good opsec. Don't panic and make mistakes. Remember: they have to prove intent. Models aren't illegal. Knowledge isn't a crime. Only actions matter.*

*If you're smart and careful, you're fine.*

*If you're not, you were always going to get caught eventually.*

He signed off and sat back, thinking.

The police weren't stupid. If they'd arrested Katarina, they'd have her phone, her computers, her forum access. They'd be analyzing the threads, building profiles, tracing connections.

How much could they learn from forum data? Enough to identify individual users? Probably not—he'd been careful about operational security. But enough to build a pattern. Enough to narrow down possibilities.

Yusuf opened a terminal and ran a search on news about economic crime investigations in Malmö.

Economic Crime Division. Detective Sara Lindqvist and IT specialist Emil Bergström. They'd been mentioned in connection with the port smuggling case, the pharmacy robberies, and now the apartment burglaries.

Two people, connecting three separate operations. Looking for patterns.

Shit.

Yusuf pulled up everything he could find on them. Sara Lindqvist—fifteen years on the force, traditional detective background, recently assigned to algorithmic crimes. Emil Bergström—five years in IT forensics, computer science degree, digital analysis specialist.

Emil would be the dangerous one. If anyone could trace model signatures or analyze code patterns, it would be him.

Yusuf looked at his own work. The pharmacy operations had been clean, he was sure of it. Burner phones, spoofed locations, no physical evidence. The models he'd used were deleted after each job, the training data fragmented and distributed.

But the methodology... that was public. On the forums. In the tutorials.

Could they connect his teaching to his operations? The coding style, the specific techniques, the architectural choices?

Possibly.

Yusuf stood up and paced his small room. Three steps to the window, three steps back. Outside, Rosengård sprawled in the winter darkness, lights in thousands of windows. His neighborhood. His people.

He'd started this to prove a point. To show that the surveillance infrastructure everyone accepted as inevitable was actually fragile. That the algorithms that sorted people into winners and losers could be beaten. That someone from Rosengård could be smarter than the entire security industry.

But if they were connecting his teaching to his operations, if they were building a profile...

He needed to think strategically.

Option one: go dark. Delete everything, destroy the hardware, disappear into normal life. Hope they didn't have enough to identify him yet.

Option two: accelerate. Do what he'd been planning anyway—build the predictive model of police behavior, document everything, prepare for the inevitable confrontation.

Option three: stop. Just stop. Accept that he'd made his point, helped dozens of people learn to protect themselves, and the risk was getting too high.

Yusuf sat down at his computer and opened a new project file. Title: "Adversarial.prediction.police."

If they were hunting him, he'd hunt them back. Learn their patterns, predict their moves, stay three steps ahead.

He'd built his entire philosophy on understanding systems. Police investigations were systems too. They had patterns, rhythms, procedures. They left data exhaust just like everyone else.

Time to see if his theories worked against the hunters.

Sara's phone buzzed as she walked back to her car. Emil.

"Found something," he said without preamble. "The coding patterns match across the forum tutorials and the pharmacy exploits. Same person created both. Adversary isn't just teaching—they're operating."

"Are you sure?"

"Ninety percent. The style is too consistent to be coincidence. Variable naming, comment structure, architectural preferences. It's the same person."

Sara unlocked her car and slid into the driver's seat. "So we're looking for someone who's both teacher and criminal."

"And they're sophisticated enough to know we're coming. If they're monitoring the forums—and they would be—they've seen the discussion about Katarina's arrest by now."

"You think they know we're hunting them?"

"I think they'd be stupid not to. And everything I've seen says they're not stupid."

Sara started the engine. "I was just in Rosengård. At a community tech center. Talking to people about algorithmic discrimination."

"Learn anything?"

"That we're hunting someone who probably had good reasons to be angry. That doesn't excuse what they did, but it explains it."

"Good reasons don't matter in court."

"No. But they might matter in how we approach them." Sara pulled out into traffic. "If they know we're coming, they'll prepare. Maybe run."

"Or fight back." Emil's voice was quiet. "Someone this sophisticated could cause us a lot of problems if they wanted to."

"Then we move fast. How soon can you narrow the profile?"

"I'm cross-referencing university records now. Computer science graduates, last five years, with addresses in working-class neighborhoods. I've got it down to forty-three possibles."

"Keep narrowing. I'm coming back to the station."

Sara drove through the darkening afternoon, watching Rosengård disappear in her rearview mirror. Somewhere in those apartment blocks, someone was probably watching back.

The hunt was mutual now.
