# Chapter 12: The Data Exhaust Economy

The apartment smelled of citrus cleaner and privilege. Sara stood in the minimalist living room of the Turning Torso penthouse while Markus Westerberg, forty-three, venture capitalist, recounted his burglary for the third time.

"I'm telling you, there was no forced entry. I checked the smart lock logs myself." He gestured at his phone. "Nothing. No alerts, no unauthorized access. But they knew exactly when I'd be gone and exactly where I keep things."

Sara had heard variations of this story six times in the past two weeks. High-end apartments, smart security systems, no physical evidence of entry. Thieves who moved through spaces like ghosts, taking only items that were valuable but not immediately missed. Small enough crimes that Economic Crime kept getting them, even though they felt like something else.

"Walk me through your routine again," Sara said. "When you're preparing for a trip."

Westerberg sighed. "I work late the night before. Come home around eleven. Pack. The cleaning service comes in the morning while I'm at my last meetings. They have a key, obviously. I leave straight from the office to the airport."

Sara's pen stopped moving. "Cleaning service."

"SweClean. They've been coming for two years. Very professional. I've never had—" He paused. "You think?"

Sara already had her phone out, pulling up the other burglary reports. Victim two: cleaning service the day before departure. Victim four: cleaning service scheduled for the morning of a business trip. Victim six: cleaning service had a key.

Not all the same company. But always cleaners. Always legitimate access. Always workers who were supposed to be invisible.

"Thank you, Herr Westerberg," Sara said. "We'll be in touch."

In the elevator down, she called Emil. "I need you to cross-reference something."

Katarina Ek arrived at the station voluntarily, which somehow made it worse. Sara had expected resistance, maybe a lawyer. Instead, she got a calm woman in her mid-forties carrying a worn leather bag and wearing the slightly shabby professionalism of someone managing on a tight budget.

"I was wondering when you'd figure it out," Katarina said as she settled into the interview room chair. "Not you specifically. Just... when someone would."

Sara set her recorder on the table. "You're not required to speak without a lawyer present."

"I know my rights. I used to teach civics." Katarina's smile was tired. "Along with mathematics and statistics. Before the budget cuts."

There it was. The ghost of a different life.

Emil sat next to Sara, his laptop open but his attention fixed on Katarina. Sara began the formal interview, stating names and time and case number for the recording. Then she asked the question she already knew the answer to.

"Did you provide information to facilitate the burglaries at addresses serviced by SweClean AB?"

"I provided predictive models," Katarina corrected. "Trained on scheduling data, movement patterns, and security system behaviors. I didn't tell anyone specifically when to rob anyone specifically. I just... made the patterns visible."

The distinction made Sara's skin crawl. It was technically precise and morally hollow.

"You trained machine learning models on your clients' data," Emil said flatly.

"On their patterns," Katarina said. "When they travel. When they're home. When the buildings do security system updates. When they order deliveries or have maintenance scheduled. All things I could observe in the course of legitimate work." She paused. "I didn't hack anything. I didn't steal passwords. I just... paid attention to what was already there."

Sara leaned forward. "And sold it."

"And sold it. Yes." Katarina met her eyes. "On a forum where people trade this kind of thing. Not to specific criminals. I posted the models and someone paid in cryptocurrency. I don't know who they are. I didn't want to know."

"You knew what they'd be used for."

"I knew they could be used for burglary, yes." Katarina's voice remained steady, almost clinical. "But theoretically they could also be used for security audits, for insurance risk assessment, for building management optimization. The models themselves are neutral. It's the application that—"

"That's bullshit," Emil said. "You weren't posting them on LinkedIn."

For the first time, something cracked in Katarina's composure. "No. I wasn't. Because legitimate companies don't pay. They expect this kind of analysis for free. They expect service workers to be invisible and grateful. But our invisibility has value. Our access has value. We generate data exhaust every time we work, and someone's going to monetize it. Why shouldn't it be us?"

Data exhaust. Sara had heard Emil use the term before, but now it hit differently. The residue of existence in a surveilled world. The patterns you left behind just by living.

"How did you learn to do this?" Sara asked. "Train the models."

"Online. There are tutorials everywhere. Machine learning isn't magic anymore; it's just another tool. I took statistics courses as part of my teaching degree. I understand probability and correlation. The rest was just following instructions." Katarina pulled out her phone, unlocked it, and slid it across the table. "The forum is in my browser history. User 'ExhaustValue.' That's me. There are dozens of people doing similar things. Delivery drivers selling route prediction models. Maintenance workers selling building access pattern data. Food service workers selling schedule predictions for restaurants. It's an economy."

Sara stared at the phone. Emil was already leaning over, scrolling through the forum with a growing expression of horror.

"Jesus Christ," he muttered. "There are hundreds of models for sale. Service workers, transit operators, meter readers... Sara, look at this one. 'Police patrol patterns, Malmö central district, 90% accuracy on response time prediction.'"

Sara's blood went cold. She took the phone from him. The listing was three weeks old. The seller's username was different, but the concept was identical: someone with access to police movements had trained a model on their patterns and was selling it to criminals.

"Who taught you this?" Sara asked quietly. "Not just tutorials. Someone active on the forums. Someone who encouraged this."

Katarina hesitated for the first time. "There's a user who posts guides. Not selling models, just teaching methods. They go by 'Adversary.' I don't know their real name. Nobody does. But they're good. They explain things clearly. They make you feel like you're not just stealing, you're... exposing how broken the system is."

Sara and Emil exchanged a look. They'd seen that username in their investigation of the pharmacy robberies. A ghost teaching ghosts how to disappear.

"My daughter needs university money," Katarina said suddenly. "She's brilliant. Top marks in everything. But I can't afford tuition on what cleaning pays. I can barely afford our rent. Emma doesn't know about any of this. She thinks I've been saving carefully." Her voice finally wavered. "I was a teacher. I had a career. I had dignity. Then the state decided my work wasn't valuable enough to fund, but her algorithm still needed to get taught. Everything got automated except the blame."

Sara thought of her father. Erik Lindqvist, dockworker, replaced by cranes and container management AI. The depression that followed him like a shadow until his heart gave out at fifty-nine. He'd been data exhaust too. Labor that generated patterns, patterns that trained the systems that replaced him.

"I understand," Sara said, and meant it. "But you victimized people."

"Rich people," Katarina said. "People who wouldn't notice a missing watch or some jewelry until they happened to look for it. People whose insurance covers it without raising premiums. Victimless."

"Violation," Sara said. "Of their homes, their privacy, their trust in the people they let into their lives. The cleaners working for you—do they know?"

"Of course not." Katarina looked genuinely horrified. "They're innocent. I would never—"

"You used them," Emil said. "Their access. Their work. They're going to be suspects now. Some of them might lose their jobs even though they did nothing wrong."

Katarina's face went gray. Sara saw the moment the full weight of it landed. The teacher in her, the person who'd spent years advocating for students and colleagues, confronting what she'd done to her own workers.

"I need to think about my lawyer now," Katarina said quietly.

Sara ended the interview. As they led Katarina to a holding cell to await processing, Emil's phone buzzed. He checked it, and his face went from grim to ashen.

"We need to talk," he said to Sara. "Privately. Now."

---

Emil's workspace in the forensics lab was a cave of monitors and half-empty coffee cups. He pulled up a data visualization that looked like a heat map of Malmö, color-coded and time-stamped.

"After Katarina mentioned police patrol patterns being sold, I pulled our own movement data," he said. "Patrol cars, response times, routine checks. I wanted to see if someone could actually build an accurate model from it."

"And?"

"It took me forty-five minutes." Emil's voice was flat. "Using freely available tools and public information combined with basic timing observations anyone could make. Look."

The visualization showed police coverage across the city in fifteen-minute intervals. The gaps were obvious—patterns where certain neighborhoods had predictable windows of low coverage. Response time variations based on time of day, day of week, seasonal factors.

"If I can do it in forty-five minutes," Emil said, "someone better than me could do it in ten. And they are better than me, Sara. The people doing this have time and motivation I don't have. They're not buried in bureaucracy and budget constraints and the legal requirement to follow proper procedure."

He pulled up another screen. "I went back to the port case. The ghost containers. I mapped out the times they were moved against our patrol patterns and customs inspection schedules." The overlay was damning. Every unauthorized container movement happened in a coverage gap. "They knew. They had a model. They knew exactly when we wouldn't be looking."

Sara sank into a chair. "The pharmacy robberies."

"Same thing. I checked. Camera reboots coinciding with police patrol gaps and pharmacy staff shift changes." Emil was clicking through case files now, each one showing the same pattern. "We're not fighting criminals, Sara. We're fighting a prediction algorithm that has us as training data."

"We change our patterns—"

"And they retrain their models. It's dynamic. They're probably scraping our public communications, watching for systematic changes, maybe even have someone inside feeding them updates." He laughed, but it wasn't funny. "We generate data exhaust too. Every time we investigate, every time we patrol, every time we respond to a call. It's all just training data for the people trying to avoid us."

Sara stared at the heat map. All those gaps. All those predictable absences. "What about the models being sold? Can we trace the buyers?"

"Cryptocurrency transactions through mixers. Tor-routed downloads. These people know how to stay anonymous." Emil leaned back, rubbing his eyes. "I've been doing this for five years. Five years of feeling like we're barely keeping up. But we're not even in the race, Sara. We're the track. We're the obstacle course they're optimizing against."

"So we quit?" Sara heard the edge in her own voice. "Just accept that the system is broken?"

"The system isn't broken." Emil gestured at the screens. "That's what Katarina said, and she's right. The system is working perfectly. For them. Surveillance capitalism generates all this data. Smart cities create all these patterns. And the people with access but no economic security—they're perfectly positioned to monetize it. We built the infrastructure for our own exploitation."

"My father," Sara said quietly, "lost his job to port automation when I was in my twenties. He spent ten years underemployed, depressed, feeling useless. He died feeling like he'd been replaced by something better."

Emil looked at her, silent.

"But you know what? The port still needed people. Chen Wei, the logistics coordinators, the maintenance workers. The automation didn't eliminate humans; it just made different humans necessary. Humans the algorithms didn't value." Sara stood up. "And those humans learned to value themselves differently. To use their access, their invisibility, their position in the system as leverage."

"Like Katarina."

"Like Katarina. Like whoever sold the police pattern models. Like all the service workers on those forums." Sara paced. "They're not breaking the system; they're exploiting the fact that the system works exactly as designed. It surveils everyone, generates data on everyone, and compensates almost no one for that data."

"So what do we do?" Emil's voice was hollow. "We can't arrest an entire economic class for responding rationally to their circumstances."

"No." Sara turned to face him. "But we can stop treating this like isolated crimes and start treating it like what it is: a systemic problem. Katarina goes to trial. She broke laws, and there have to be consequences. But we also need to document how this works. Build a case that goes beyond individuals."

"A case against what? Surveillance capitalism? Good luck prosecuting that."

"A case for understanding." Sara sat down next to him. "You're right that we're outmatched technically. We probably always will be. But we can learn how this economy works. We can map it. We can find the people teaching others how to do this—like this 'Adversary' user Katarina mentioned."

"And then what?" Emil challenged. "We arrest them and someone else takes their place?"

"Maybe. Probably." Sara met his eyes. "But we can also push for policy changes. Regulations on what data employers can collect on workers. Restrictions on how building systems surveil residents. Better compensation for the access and information we expect service workers to provide. We can't win by playing their game. We have to change the game."

Emil was quiet for a long moment. "That's naive."

"Yes."

"It'll take years. Decades. And we'll still lose cases."

"Yes."

"And you want to do it anyway."

"I want to try." Sara leaned forward. "Because the alternative is what? Accepting that we're just here to watch criminals get better at crime? I didn't become a detective to document inevitability."

Emil looked at his screens, at the heat maps and case files and evidence of their own exploitation. Then he pulled up a new document.

"Okay," he said. "Then we need to start by mapping the whole ecosystem. Everyone on those forums. Every type of data exhaust being sold. Every method they're teaching. If we're going to understand this economy, we need to see all of it."

"Including where our own data ends up."

"Especially that." Emil started typing. "Because if police patterns are for sale, what else is? Prosecutor schedules? Court security? Evidence transport routes?"

The implications spiraled outward. Every system that generated patterns could be weaponized. Every routine was a vulnerability.

Sara's phone rang. The number was internal—someone from the port investigation team.

"Lindqvist," she answered.

"We've got a name from the container logs," the voice said. "Someone who accessed the system at times that match some of the unauthorized movements. Chen Wei. Port logistics coordinator. We're bringing her in now."

Sara felt the pieces shifting. The port case connecting to the pattern. Another worker with access. Another person made invisible by the systems they served.

"Keep me updated," she said. "I want to be there for the interview."

She hung up and looked at Emil. "Chen Wei. Port worker. They think she's involved in the smuggling."

Emil pulled up their port case files, cross-referencing the name. "She'd have access to all the shipping data, schedule information, security patrol patterns for the port facilities."

"More data exhaust."

"Everything's data exhaust now." Emil's expression was a mix of exhaustion and determination. "So we map it. All of it. We build the case. We expose how it works."

"Even knowing we might not win."

"Especially knowing that." Emil managed a ghost of a smile. "If we're going to be data exhaust for someone else's prediction model, we might as well be noisy about it. Make the pattern harder to read."

Sara felt something settle in her chest. Not hope, exactly. Something more durable. Purpose, maybe. Or just stubborn refusal to accept obsolescence without a fight.

"I need to check something in Katarina's phone records," she said. "See if we can trace any of the other forum users. Build connections."

"I'll keep mapping the data exhaust economy. See how many different service sectors are involved." Emil was already typing again, energy returning to his movements. "And I want to analyze the models themselves. They leave artifacts. Training data bias, architectural patterns. If the same person or group is teaching methodology, it'll show up in how the models are built."

They worked in parallel silence for a while, the kind of comfortable focus that came from partnership and shared purpose. Sara found what she was looking for in Katarina's browser history: multiple conversations with the user "Adversary," always asking questions about model optimization, always getting detailed, pedagogical responses.

Whoever Adversary was, they were systematic. A teacher, like Katarina had been. Someone who saw this not as simple theft but as a kind of protest. Exposing the system by exploiting it.

"Emil," Sara said. "Hypothesis: What if the person teaching everyone isn't doing it for money?"

"Then why?"

"Because they want to prove it can be done. They want to expose the vulnerabilities. Make it impossible to ignore."

Emil considered this. "That's either very noble or very destructive."

"Both, probably." Sara made a note. "We need to find them. Adversary. They're the key to understanding how all of this connects."

"If they exist as a single person. Could be a group. Could be a shared identity."

"Could be. But Katarina talked about them like a person. Someone teaching with intention." Sara looked at the forum threads again. "The way they explain things. It's patient. Clear. They're not just distributing tools; they're educating. There's ideology here."

"Ideology that encourages crime."

"Ideology that says surveillance infrastructure can be turned against itself." Sara saved the threads to their case file. "We need to understand that ideology to counter it. Or maybe to learn from it."

Emil raised an eyebrow. "Learn from the criminals?"

"Learn from the people the system made invisible and then gave access." Sara stood, feeling the weight of the case settling into a new shape. "We've been treating this like catching bad guys. But it's bigger than that. It's about what happens when your labor becomes data, your access becomes capital, and your invisibility becomes power."

"Poetic," Emil said dryly. "Doesn't make it legal."

"No. But it makes it understandable." Sara headed for the door. "I'm going to see if Chen Wei is here yet. Want to sit in on the interview?"

"Wouldn't miss it." Emil saved his work and stood. "Sara? Thanks."

"For what?"

"For not letting me quit. I was halfway there."

"I know. I could tell." She paused at the door. "We're going to lose a lot of these cases."

"Probably most of them."

"But we're going to understand how it works. And that matters."

"Yeah," Emil said, following her out. "It does."

As they walked down the corridor toward the interview rooms, Sara thought about her father again. About how he'd tried to adapt, to learn new skills, to stay relevant. How the effort had worn him down not because he was incapable but because the system didn't value adaptation from people it had already categorized as obsolete.

Katarina was sitting in a holding cell, probably thinking about her daughter. Chen Wei was about to be questioned about smuggling, another invisible worker caught in systems bigger than herself. And somewhere, Adversary was teaching more people how to turn their data exhaust into weapons.

The midpoint of the investigation, Sara realized, wasn't about arrests. It was about understanding. They'd spent weeks chasing ghosts—containers that looked legitimate, thieves who left no traces, patterns that seemed random. Now they could see the shape of it. The economy of invisibility. The weaponization of surveillance against itself.

They couldn't beat it. Not directly. But they could map it, expose it, make it impossible to ignore.

That would have to be enough.

For now.
