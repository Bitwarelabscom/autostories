# Chapter 9

The Serenity House Hospice sat in a quiet corner of Brookline, a converted Victorian mansion with gardens that would be beautiful in spring but looked skeletal and gray in February. Reeves parked across the street, watching patients in wheelchairs positioned by the windows, watching the world they were leaving behind.

He'd called ahead, spoken to the director, explained that he was investigating a case—not a crime, just background—and would appreciate any information about Sarah Harrington's final months. The director, a woman named Patricia Chen (no relation to Dr. Lisa Chen, she'd clarified), had agreed to meet him.

The lobby smelled of lavender and something medicinal underneath. Classical music played softly from hidden speakers. Everything designed to soothe, to comfort, to make the unbearable slightly more bearable.

"Detective Reeves?" Patricia Chen was in her sixties, with silver hair pulled back in a bun and the kind of calm presence that came from years of sitting with the dying. "Come, let's talk in my office."

Her office was small but warm, filled with photos of smiling staff and patients, thank-you cards pinned to a cork board, a shelf of books about grief and caregiving. Reeves sat in the chair she indicated, feeling oddly intrusive, like he was trespassing on sacred ground.

"You asked about Sarah Harrington," Patricia said, settling behind her desk. "That was, oh, eight years ago now. But I remember her well. Some patients you remember."

"What do you remember?"

Patricia's eyes grew distant, thoughtful. "Sarah was a professor. Literature, I believe. Very articulate, very precise in her speech, even as the disease progressed. ALS is particularly cruel that way—it takes your body but leaves your mind intact. You're trapped, watching yourself disappear piece by piece."

"How long was she here?"

"Three months, at the end. Before that, her daughter cared for her at home. Olivia." Patricia smiled slightly. "Dr. Harrington. She's quite well-known now, I understand. Cardiologist."

"She is." Reeves pulled out his notebook, more for something to do with his hands than because he needed to write this down. Every word was etching itself into his memory. "What was Dr. Harrington like as a caretaker?"

"Devoted. Absolutely devoted." Patricia leaned forward, hands folded on her desk. "She was here every day, sometimes twice a day. Morning before her hospital rounds, evening after. She'd read to her mother, play music, just sit and hold her hand when Sarah couldn't communicate anymore. But Detective—"

She paused, choosing words carefully.

"There was something heartbreaking about watching Dr. Harrington care for her mother. She's a physician, you understand. Someone trained to fix problems, to heal. And there was nothing she could do. No treatment that worked, no cure, no intervention that mattered. I watched it eat at her, that helplessness."

"Did she ever talk about it?"

"Once." Patricia stood, moved to the window overlooking the garden. "It was near the end, maybe a week before Sarah passed. I found Dr. Harrington in the family room, crying. Not quiet tears—this was the kind of crying that comes from somewhere deep, the kind that breaks you open. I sat with her, and she said—" Patricia closed her eyes, remembering. "She said, 'I can restart a stopped heart. I can repair valves, clear arteries, regulate rhythms. But I can't help my own mother. I can't stop this. I can't even ease it. All I can do is watch her suffocate, and there's no mercy in that. No mercy at all.'"

*No mercy in that.* Reeves wrote it down, underlining it twice.

"What happened in the final days?"

"Sarah lost the ability to swallow, then to breathe without assistance. We had her on a ventilator, but she'd signed a DNR—do not resuscitate. No extreme measures. When her organs started failing, Dr. Harrington made the decision to remove life support. It was what Sarah wanted, what she'd specified in her advanced directive. But still—"

"It's not easy," Reeves said quietly, "ending someone's life, even when it's the merciful thing to do."

Patricia looked at him sharply. "Detective, we don't end lives here. We allow natural death when prolonging life becomes cruelty. There's a difference."

"Is there?" The question came out before Reeves could stop it. "Philosophically, I mean. If someone is suffering, if their death is inevitable, if continuing means nothing but pain—is removing life support really that different from, say, administering a medication that speeds the process? Both achieve the same end. Both stop suffering."

"One is legal," Patricia said firmly. "The other is murder."

"Even if the intent is identical? Even if both are done out of compassion?"

She studied him, her expression troubled. "Why are you really here, Detective? This isn't just background for a case, is it?"

Reeves met her eyes. "Did Dr. Harrington ever talk about assisted death? About euthanasia, mercy killing, anything like that?"

"Not directly. But—" Patricia returned to her desk, sat heavily. "After Sarah passed, Dr. Harrington made a donation to the hospice. A substantial one. The dedication said it was 'for research into compassionate end-of-life care.' She also became involved with several right-to-die advocacy groups. I know because she listed me as a reference. Organizations supporting medical aid in dying for terminally ill patients."

"Medical aid in dying." Reeves tasted the euphemism. "Assisted suicide."

"It's legal in some states. Oregon, Washington, Vermont. The patient takes a prescribed medication that ends their life peacefully. But it requires terminal diagnosis, mental competency, multiple requests over time. There are safeguards."

"And if someone wasn't terminally ill? If they were causing harm, destroying lives, and someone with medical knowledge decided their death would be merciful—to their future victims, if not to them?"

Patricia's face went pale. "That's not mercy, Detective. That's murder."

"Even if it stops suffering? Even if it saves lives?"

"Who decides?" Her voice rose slightly, the first crack in her professional calm. "Who gets to play God and determine whose life has value and whose doesn't? That's not medicine. That's not compassion. That's—"

She stopped, staring at him. "This is about a specific case, isn't it? Someone is dead, and you think Dr. Harrington—" She shook her head. "No. Absolutely not. Olivia Harrington is a dedicated physician. She watched her mother suffer, yes, and it changed her, yes, but she would never—"

"How did it change her?" Reeves leaned forward. "Specifically. What was different after her mother's death?"

Patricia was quiet for a long moment. Outside, winter sun slanted through the windows, painting everything in cold gold. "She became harder," she said finally. "More controlled. Like she'd locked something away inside herself. When she visited to make that donation, to check on how we were using it, she was perfectly polite, perfectly professional. But there was a distance that hadn't been there before. Like she'd decided that feeling too much was dangerous."

Reeves thought about Harrington in her office, explaining delayed-release poisons with clinical precision. Admitting motive without emotion. Maintaining perfect control even under suspicion.

Someone who'd learned that caring too deeply led to helpless suffering. Someone who'd decided to protect herself by becoming untouchable.

Or someone who'd learned that if you couldn't save the people you loved, maybe you could at least stop the people who caused harm.

He thanked Patricia Chen and left, driving through Boston's afternoon traffic on autopilot, his mind turning over everything he'd learned. The pattern was clear now, the motive crystalline. Harrington had watched pointless suffering, had been forced by law and ethics to let her mother die slowly when a faster death would have been kinder. And then she'd encountered Jonathan Sterling, inflicting purposeful suffering, destroying careers and lives for ego, and she'd seen—what? An opportunity? A moral imperative?

A chance to do what the law wouldn't let her do for her mother—choose mercy over suffering?

But knowing motive wasn't the same as proving murder. Understanding why someone might kill didn't demonstrate that they had.

His phone rang. Dr. Chen.

"Marcus, I've been thinking about what you asked me yesterday. About whether it's theoretically possible to create an undetectable poison."

"And?"

"And I did some research. Dug into some old toxicology journals, looked at experimental compounds that never made it to clinical trials." She paused. "There's a class of synthetic cardiac glycosides that could theoretically induce cardiac arrest while mimicking the cellular patterns of natural heart failure. They're unstable—designed to degrade within forty-eight to seventy-two hours. Someone with advanced knowledge of cardiac pharmacology could potentially synthesize them."

Reeves pulled over, giving the conversation his full attention. "How advanced?"

"Ph.D. level at minimum. Probably someone who'd published in the field, who had access to laboratory equipment and chemical suppliers. And it would take time—months, maybe years—to perfect the compound, to test it, to ensure it worked exactly as intended."

"Someone like Dr. Harrington."

Silence on the line. Then: "Marcus, we still have no evidence such a compound was used. We have no chemical trace, no proof of synthesis, nothing. All I have is hypoxic cell damage that could have a dozen explanations."

"But it could be explained by this theoretical poison."

"It could be, yes. But 'could be' isn't proof. It's barely even probable cause."

Reeves watched traffic flow past him, people in their cars heading home to dinner and families and ordinary evenings. Lives continuing, unchanged, while he sat here trying to prove that one life had been deliberately ended.

"Lisa, if someone watched their mother die slowly, painfully, and the law required them to just witness that suffering without being able to end it mercifully—do you think that might make them more likely to, I don't know, take matters into their own hands in a different situation?"

"Are we talking about Harrington's mother?"

"We are."

He heard her exhale slowly. "I don't know. Maybe. Watching prolonged death changes people. I see it all the time. Some people become more compassionate, more committed to reducing suffering. Others become harder, more fatalistic. And some—" She stopped.

"Some what?"

"Some start to see death differently. Not as the enemy to fight at all costs, but as a tool. A solution. The end of suffering, which makes it a kind of mercy." Her voice dropped. "I had a colleague once, an oncologist. Brilliant woman. She lost her sister to a particularly brutal cancer. Six months of agony, every treatment failing, just prolonging the dying. After the sister finally passed, this colleague started advocating for more aggressive palliative sedation. Not quite euthanasia, but close. The idea that if someone is actively dying and in pain, we should sedate them completely until death comes naturally."

"That's legal, isn't it?"

"In some circumstances, yes. But she started pushing for it in cases where death wasn't imminent, where there were still treatment options. She got reprimanded, eventually left the hospital. Last I heard, she'd moved to Oregon, where assisted dying is legal." Chen paused. "My point is, watching someone you love suffer can radicalize you. Can make you see mercy where others see murder."

"And if the person dying isn't someone you love? If they're someone causing suffering to others?"

"Then I don't know what to call it. Justice? Vigilantism? A twisted form of compassion?" She sighed. "Marcus, even if everything you suspect is true—even if Dr. Harrington created this poison and used it on Professor Sterling—how do you prove it? How do you build a case without evidence, without witnesses, without a confession?"

"I don't know yet," Reeves admitted. "But there has to be a way. She's brilliant, but she's not perfect. Nobody is."

After they hung up, Reeves sat in his car as darkness fell over Boston. The city lights came on, one by one, pushing back the winter night. Somewhere in those lights was Olivia Harrington, finishing her shift at Mass General, saving lives with the same knowledge she'd used to end one.

He understood her now. Understood the terrible logic that might drive a doctor who'd been forced to watch meaningless suffering to take action against meaningful cruelty. Understood the philosophical argument that killing one person to save many might not be murder but mathematics.

But understanding wasn't acceptance. And empathy wasn't proof.

The question that haunted him wasn't whether Harrington had killed Sterling. He was increasingly certain she had. The question was whether he could prove it—and whether, if he did, a jury would see a murderer or a doctor who'd simply chosen a different kind of mercy.

His phone buzzed with a text from Ethan: *Still digging into research logs. Looks like Harrington ordered some unusual compounds 6 months ago. Gonna take time to track everything.*

Time. The one thing they might not have. Captain Walsh wanted the case closed. The evidence pointed to natural causes. And every day that passed made it easier for Harrington to believe she'd gotten away with it, easier for the trail to go cold, easier for justice to slip through his fingers like it had with Webb.

Reeves started the car, pulled back into traffic. He had a direction now, a motive, a theory. What he didn't have was proof.

But he would find it. He had to.

Because if he couldn't prove that Olivia Harrington had committed the perfect murder, then perfection would triumph over justice, intelligence over truth, and the lesson would be clear: if you're smart enough and careful enough, you can kill with impunity as long as you dress it up as mercy.

And Marcus Reeves couldn't—wouldn't—let that stand.

Even if part of him, the part that had watched his mentor die helplessly, the part that understood suffering and the desperate need to end it, whispered that maybe Harrington was right.

Maybe Sterling had deserved exactly what he got.

Maybe mercy came in forms the law didn't recognize.

Maybe justice wasn't always the same as truth.

He pushed those thoughts away and drove into the night, hunting for proof of a crime he understood too well and couldn't quite bring himself to condemn.
