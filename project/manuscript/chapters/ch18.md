# Chapter 18: Processing

The interrogation room smelled like stale coffee and stress sweat. Sara had been sitting across from Chen Wei for three hours, and they'd barely scratched the surface of the smuggling network. Her recorder's memory card was already at seventy percent capacity.

"The container manifests were altered at the point of origin," Chen said, her voice flat with exhaustion. She'd moved past fear into something like relief, the unburdening that comes after you've finally stopped running. "Shanghai, Rotterdam, Hamburg. The network has people in all six ports. They work the same way—attack the automation, make the system see what it expects to see."

Sara made notes in her precise handwriting. "And the people being smuggled?"

Chen's hands tightened around her paper cup of tea, gone cold an hour ago. "Syrian, Afghan, Iraqi families mostly. They pay twenty thousand euros each. The syndicate promises them entry to Sweden without the asylum bureaucracy. Without the waiting. Without being tracked."

"Invisibility through pattern," Emil murmured from his position by the wall. He'd been recording technical details on his laptop, building the forensic documentation they'd need for Europol.

"Yes." Chen looked at him directly for the first time in the session. "That's exactly right. Your system looks for anomalies. We gave it the pattern it expected. Empty container, proper documentation, standard route. The people were hidden inside furniture, appliances, legitimate cargo in the other containers. Split the risk across multiple units."

Sara leaned forward. "Who designed the ML attack on the port systems?"

Chen hesitated. This was the dangerous part, the testimony that would make her a target. "I don't know his real name. On the encrypted channels, he goes by 'Architect.' Chinese national, probably lives in Shenzhen or Guangzhou. He doesn't move the people or handle the money. He just sells the technique. Five thousand euros for the training package, another ten thousand for ongoing support."

"Supporting documentation?" Emil asked, already knowing the answer.

"Screenshots, encrypted chat logs, payment records through crypto mixers." Chen reached into the folder Sara had provided. "I saved everything. I knew..." She paused, choosing her words carefully. "I knew someday I would need proof that I was forced. That my family was threatened."

Sara had seen the messages already. Chen's parents and brother in Dalian, photographed outside their apartment building. The implied threat clear even without explicit language. *Beautiful family. Would be unfortunate if something happened.*

"We've contacted Interpol," Sara said. "Your family will be moved to a protected location. The Chinese police are cooperating."

Chen's expression suggested she'd believe that when she saw it. Sara didn't blame her. Trust wasn't something you built with three hours of conversation after months of coercion.

"Let's take a break," Sara said, checking her watch. 14:40. She'd been at work since six that morning. Her back hurt, her eyes were scratchy, and she had another interview at 16:00.

Yusuf Hassan sat in the consultation room with his public defender, a efficient woman named Astrid Malm who'd seen enough algorithmic crime cases to not look surprised by anything anymore. Sara and the prosecutor, Henrik Forsberg, sat across the table. Emil was remote, attending via video link from the forensics lab.

"Let me be clear about what we're offering," Henrik said, laying out the terms with bureaucratic precision. "No prison time. Two years probation. Eight hundred hours of community service, specifically defined as training police forensics teams in adversarial ML defense. Full cooperation with our investigation into dark web markets where you sold your techniques. Testimony if required for prosecution of your buyers."

Astrid made notes. "And the charges?"

"Multiple counts of commercial burglary, computer intrusion, unauthorized access to secured systems. We're dropping the organized crime enhancements in exchange for cooperation." Henrik slid the formal offer across the table. "This is contingent on your client providing genuine value in training. If Police Commissioner Lundgren determines he's not participating in good faith, the deal terminates."

Yusuf read through the document with the attention to detail Sara expected. He was seeing the system from the inside now—the procedural language, the bureaucratic contingencies, the way law enforcement hedged its bets.

"Eight hundred hours is nearly six months of full-time work," Astrid noted.

"We can spread it over the two-year probation period," Sara said. "Four hours per week, roughly. Enough that he can maintain his legitimate employment." She looked directly at Yusuf. "Malmö Logistics confirmed they're willing to keep you on staff, by the way. They understand the value of having someone who knows how criminals think about system vulnerabilities."

That got a reaction—surprise, quickly masked. Yusuf had expected to lose everything.

"What exactly would I be teaching?" he asked.

Emil's voice came through the speaker. "Adversarial ML defense. How to recognize attack patterns. How to reverse-engineer exploits from system behavior. How to think like someone who wants to break our systems." A pause. "Essentially, how to think like you."

Yusuf met Sara's eyes. "You're serious about this. The whole 'changing the system from inside' thing."

"We're serious about not having another generation of criminals figure out what you figured out," Sara said. "You can disappear into the dark web again, earn another few hundred thousand kronor selling exploits, and wait for someone else to catch you. Or you can teach us how to defend against this. Make it harder for the next algorithm broker."

"I'm not naive," Yusuf said. "Someone will always find the next exploit. Security is a losing game."

"Probably," Sara agreed. "But maybe we can raise the skill floor. Make it hard enough that desperate economics teachers and logistics coordinators can't just download a tutorial and become criminals."

Astrid glanced at her client. The decision was his.

Yusuf signed. The pen scratched against paper, a sound like a door closing and another one opening.

The courthouse smelled like floor polish and quiet desperation. Sara sat in the gallery as Katarina Ek stood for sentencing. The hearing had been short, clinical. Katarina had pled guilty to all charges, waiving her right to a full trial.

Judge Nilsson read from her notes. "Ms. Ek, you've been convicted of multiple counts of burglary, illegal access to computer systems, and fraud. The prosecution has recommended a sentence of four years imprisonment, citing the sophistication of your crimes and their systematic nature."

Katarina stood very straight, her hands clasped in front of her. Her daughter Emma sat three rows behind Sara, stone-faced, processing the fact that her mother was a criminal.

"However," the judge continued, "the court has considered several mitigating factors. Your full cooperation with police. The economic circumstances that contributed to your actions. Your lack of prior criminal history. The fact that you turned your access to data exhaust into crime, but did not abuse your position of trust with the vulnerable workers you managed."

Sara had submitted a statement to that effect. It mattered that Katarina had committed crimes against the wealthy clients, not the cleaning workers whose data she'd harvested. It was a fine moral distinction, but the law ran on fine distinctions.

"The court sentences you to two years imprisonment, with eligibility for early release after fourteen months subject to good behavior and completion of rehabilitative programming. You'll also be required to forfeit all proceeds from your criminal activity—approximately three hundred and sixty thousand kronor seized from your accounts."

Emma's face didn't change, but her hands gripped the bench in front of her.

"You'll surrender yourself to Ystad Prison next Monday to begin serving your sentence. Do you understand?"

"Yes, Your Honor." Katarina's voice was steady, but Sara saw the tremor in her shoulders.

The gavel came down. Two years. Emma's mother would miss her graduation from gymnasium, the first year of university. She'd return to a daughter who'd had to grow up fast, who'd learned that economic desperation could turn a teacher into a thief.

Sara filed out with the rest of the observers. In the hallway, Emma stood alone, staring at nothing.

"She did cooperate fully," Sara said quietly, stopping beside her. "That counted for something."

Emma turned. Fifteen going on thirty, her eyes older than they should be. "Did she tell you it was for me? For my education fund?"

"She did."

"I got a scholarship last week. Full ride to Lund, mathematics program. I didn't need her crime money." Emma's voice was very controlled. "I never needed it."

Sara had nothing to say to that. Sometimes the wounds opened after the crisis ended, not during.

That evening, Sara and Emil sat in her office with takeout Thai food neither of them had the appetite for. The adrenaline that had sustained them through the investigation had drained away, leaving exhaustion and the particular emptiness that came after a case closed.

"Chen flies to her protection location on Friday," Sara said, picking at pad see ew. "Somewhere in Norrland. New identity, new job lined up in forestry logistics. She'll testify via video link when Europol needs her."

"She'll spend the rest of her life looking over her shoulder," Emil said. "International smuggling syndicates don't forget."

"No. But she'll be alive, and her family will be safe." Sara set down her fork. "That's more than she had three days ago."

Emil nodded. He looked as wrecked as she felt. "Yusuf starts training sessions next week. Two hours every Wednesday and Friday. I'm supposed to work with him to develop a curriculum for the academy."

"You don't sound thrilled."

"I'm teaching police cadets with a guy who spent three years proving he could run circles around us." Emil managed a tired smile. "It's humbling."

"Good," Sara said. "We could use more humility."

They sat in silence for a moment, watching the winter dark through the window. Malmö at night, thousands of smart systems generating data exhaust, thousands of patterns waiting to be exploited.

"The Commissioner wants to see you tomorrow," Emil said finally. "Something about a specialized unit."

Sara had been expecting that call. "They'll want me to lead it. Algorithmic Crime Task Force or something equally bureaucratic."

"You should do it."

"I haven't decided yet."

"Sara." Emil set down his food container. "You literally just cracked three major cases by recognizing a pattern no one else saw. You turned an adversary into an ally because you understood what he needed. You protected a terrified witness. You got justice that actually looks like justice instead of just revenge." He paused. "If you don't lead this unit, they'll give it to someone who thinks they can solve algorithmic crime with better algorithms."

"Can we solve it at all?" Sara asked. "Or are we just buying time until the next generation figures out the next exploit?"

"Does it matter?" Emil's voice was gentle but firm. "Someone has to understand this stuff. Someone has to care about the Chen Weis and the Katarina Eks. Someone has to see the patterns. That's you."

Sara looked at the stack of case files on her desk. The ghost containers. The pharmacy robberies. The apartment burglaries. Three parallel investigations that converged because she'd been stubborn enough to see the connections.

"I'll take the meeting," she said.

At 22:00, Sara walked through Limhamn Harbor one more time. The container stacks rose against the winter sky, lit by sodium lamps. The automated cranes moved with mechanical precision, following algorithms that Chen Wei had helped attack.

The port would upgrade its security. New protocols, better monitoring, adversarial detection systems. It would help. For a while. Until someone figured out the next vulnerability.

Her father had worked here, thirty years ago. Before the automation, before the algorithms, when dockworkers were still essential. He'd been good at his job. It hadn't mattered.

Sara understood now that she couldn't stop progress. Couldn't turn back the automation. Couldn't make human labor essential again in a world that had learned to optimize it away.

But she could make sure the next Chen Wei had someone to call. The next Yusuf had options besides crime. The next Katarina didn't have to choose between her dignity and her daughter's education.

It wasn't winning. It was just refusing to lose completely.

Her phone buzzed. A text from Emil: *Commissioner meeting at 09:00. Don't be late. Wear something that says "I'm responsible enough to run a specialized unit."*

She smiled slightly. Texted back: *Do I own anything that says that?*

*No. Fake it.*

Sara pocketed her phone and walked back to her car. The harbor stretched out behind her, patterns in the noise, ghosts in the system.

Tomorrow she'd start building something new. Tonight, she allowed herself to be tired.

The work would be there in the morning. It always was.
