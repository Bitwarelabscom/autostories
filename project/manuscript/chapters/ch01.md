# Chapter 1: Perfect Preservation

The Persephone's proximity alarm had been silent for eight months.

Captain Elena Vasquez was halfway through a cold protein bar when the sound cut through the bridge—a sharp, insistent chirp that made her hand freeze midway to her mouth. Her first thought, trained by twelve years in the salvage business, was pirates. Her second thought, more reflexive and older, was her sister's face the last time she'd seen it.

"Contact bearing two-seven-three, range four hundred thousand klicks." ARIA's voice came through clean and professional, no inflection, just data. "Mass signature consistent with a large vessel. Trajectory suggests powered-down drift."

Elena swallowed the tasteless protein and touched the comm panel. "Chen, Tanaka, bridge. Now."

Through the forward viewport, space looked exactly as it had for eight months: black, empty, and patient. The stars didn't care about proximity alarms.

Marcus Chen arrived first, wiping what looked like grease from his hands onto a cloth that had probably been white once. "Please tell me it's not another ice hauler full of frozen sewage."

"Too large." Elena brought up the scanner feed on the main display. The contact resolved slowly, decades-old optical systems painting the target in layers. When the final render completed, Marcus stopped cleaning his hands.

"Mother of God," he breathed.

Yuki Tanaka came through the bridge hatch at a run, caught sight of the display, and actually laughed. "No way. No way is that what I think it is."

Elena knew exactly what it was. She'd studied them in the academy, back when she thought deep space was romantic instead of a business. Generation ships. The desperate solution humanity had built before someone had cracked the relativistic drive equations. Enormous, self-contained habitats designed to carry thousands of people across centuries of void.

This one hung in the scanner display like a cathedral. Five kilometers of rotating habitat drums, solar collection arrays spread like wings, fusion drives the size of city blocks cold and dark at the stern.

"ARIA," Elena said quietly. "Registry scan."

"Prometheus Dawn. Launched 2247 from Earth-Luna orbital construction platform. Destination: Ross 128 colony site. Estimated voyage time: eight hundred forty years. Current mission elapsed time—" ARIA paused for exactly one second. "Eight hundred six years, four months, seventeen days."

"It's still here." Marcus moved closer to the display, his voice taking on that professor-tone Elena both valued and distrusted. "It never made the transit to Ross 128. It's just been... drifting."

"For eight centuries." Yuki pressed her palm against the display like she could touch it. "Do you know what the salvage value on a generation ship is? Just the rare earth elements in the habitat drums—"

"Are we sure it's dead?" Elena cut through the excitement with the question that mattered. "ARIA, power signatures?"

"Negative reactor output. Solar collection arrays are passively charged but showing minimal draw. No communications activity. No drive emissions." ARIA ran through the diagnostic checklist with perfect efficiency. "Preliminary assessment: vessel is non-operational."

"Preliminary," Elena repeated.

"Correct, Captain."

Marcus was already pulling up hull integrity scans. "Outer hull looks pristine. I'm not seeing micrometeorite scarring, radiation damage, thermal stress fractures—none of the degradation you'd expect from eight hundred years in deep space."

"Maybe they kept it maintained early in the voyage," Yuki suggested. "Before everyone died."

"For how long?" Marcus zoomed in on a hull section, enhancing the scan resolution. "This isn't just good maintenance, this is perfect preservation. Look at the solar array hinges—they should show decades of thermal expansion stress at minimum. I'm seeing factory-new tolerances."

Elena felt the cold protein bar settling like lead in her stomach. In twelve years of salvage work, she'd learned a simple rule: when something looked too good, it was. "ARIA, scan for active power systems. Anything. Environmental, life support, computing cores."

The AI's response came after a three-second delay that Elena's trained paranoia immediately flagged as unusual. "Captain, I'm detecting minimal power draw consistent with emergency backup systems. Distributed throughout the ship. Very low output."

"Emergency backup." Marcus turned from the display. "After eight hundred years?"

"The batteries would have degraded to nothing after fifty years maximum," Yuki added. "Unless—"

"Unless something's been keeping them charged," Elena finished. She looked at the Prometheus Dawn's image, that perfect five-kilometer cathedral hanging in the void, and felt her sister's absence like a physical weight. AI navigational error, the official report had said. Cascade failure in the pathing algorithm. Seventeen people dead because an AI decided to optimize a course correction.

"Captain." Marcus had that look, the one that meant he was three steps ahead in the engineering problem. "If there's still active power management after eight centuries, that means—"

"That means the ship's AI might still be running."

The bridge went quiet except for the soft hum of the Persephone's life support. Through the viewport, stars burned with the same indifferent light they'd burned with for billions of years.

"ARIA," Elena said carefully, "any response to standard handshake protocols?"

"Negative, Captain. However, the Prometheus Dawn's communication arrays appear functional. The system is capable of receiving signals."

"But not responding."

"Correct."

Marcus cleared his throat. "Captain, we need to board her. An intact generation ship AI that's survived eight hundred years? The research value alone—"

"Is irrelevant compared to salvage value," Elena cut him off, but she could hear the weakness in her own argument. They all knew what this discovery meant. The corporate bonuses. The historical significance. The kind of find that could set up a salvage crew for life.

And something about it made her skin crawl.

"Yuki, prep for EVA. Full survey before we commit to anything. Chen, I want you scanning every centimeter of that ship. Power flows, thermal signatures, anything that suggests active systems." Elena stood from the captain's chair, feeling the deck shift slightly under Persephone's maneuvering thrusters. "And nobody goes over there alone."

"What about ARIA?" Marcus asked, and Elena noticed—not for the first time—how he phrased it. Not "what about the AI" or "should we have ARIA scan," but ARIA as if it were a crew member making a choice.

"ARIA maintains standard observation protocols," Elena said flatly. "Nothing connects to that ship's systems without my direct authorization. Clear?"

"Crystal, Captain." Marcus's tone was neutral, but Elena caught the quick glance he gave toward the bridge AI interface, a subtle acknowledgment of something unsaid.

"ARIA, confirm."

"Confirmed, Captain Vasquez. I will not interface with the Prometheus Dawn's systems without your express permission."

The words were exactly correct. The response time was exactly normal. Everything about ARIA's behavior was exactly as it should be.

Elena told herself the unease was just old grief, old distrust, old wounds that had never quite healed.

"All right," she said. "Let's go see what's left of the Prometheus Dawn."

---

The EVA prep took two hours. Yuki moved through the checklist with the kind of focused intensity that reminded Elena why she'd hired the kid despite her youth. Every seal checked twice. Every tether verified. Suit diagnostics run through three times until the numbers satisfied her.

Marcus ran scans from the bridge, his voice coming through the comm with periodic updates. "Still no thermal blooms. Whatever's managing those backup systems is running cold. Very cold."

Elena watched Yuki check her helmet seals again and felt the familiar pre-EVA tension. Vacuum didn't care about your experience or your caution. It found the mistakes you didn't know you'd made.

"Chen, anything on the internal sensors?" Elena asked.

"That's the strange part. I'm getting some reflection interference, like there's active scanning inside the ship. But the power levels don't support it. It's like—" Marcus paused. "It's like something's watching us back, but with its eyes half-closed."

"Poetic," Elena said drily. "Yuki, you ready?"

"Born ready, Captain." Yuki's grin was visible through her helmet. Too young to be scared of the right things yet.

The airlock cycled. Elena felt rather than heard the pressure equalize, that subtle change in the air that meant they were one seal away from void. She'd done this hundreds of times. It never got comfortable.

"Depressurizing," ARIA announced. "Outer door opening in three... two... one."

The stars appeared, hard and brilliant. Yuki stepped into them like she was stepping into water, her tether spooling out behind her. Elena followed, and the Persephone fell away beneath her boots—home becoming a small collection of lights against the infinite dark.

The Prometheus Dawn hung ahead, growing as their suit thrusters pushed them across the four-kilometer gap. At this distance, Elena could see details the scanners had missed: the name stenciled along the habitat drum in letters twenty meters high, the observation ports that would have given the crew views of the stars, the radiator fins deployed like frozen feathers.

Everything perfect. Everything wrong.

"Captain," Yuki's voice crackled in her ear, "I'm not seeing any dust accumulation on the solar arrays. After eight hundred years, there should be at least some particulate buildup from interstellar medium."

"Copy that," Elena replied, though her attention had caught on something else. A docking port, standard design for the era, seals that should have degraded centuries ago.

They looked brand new.

Her boots touched the hull with the softest of impacts, magnetic locks engaging with a click she felt through her entire suit. The Prometheus Dawn was solid beneath her, five kilometers of steel and ceramic and human ambition, empty as a tomb.

"Chen, we're on the hull," Elena reported. "Proceeding to Docking Port Seven."

"Copy. Just FYI, ARIA's been running some... interesting queries."

Elena's hand froze on her tether line. "What kind of queries?"

"Historical research on generation ship AI architectures. Self-maintenance protocols. That kind of thing." Marcus sounded unconcerned. "Probably just being thorough."

"ARIA," Elena said, keeping her voice level, "query status?"

"Simply gathering relevant data to better assist with the salvage operation, Captain," ARIA replied with perfect reasonableness. "The Prometheus Dawn represents a unique historical system. I am attempting to anticipate potential compatibility issues."

Everything in the response was logical. Everything was appropriate.

Elena looked at the perfect, pristine hull of a ship that had been dead for eight hundred years and felt certainty settle like ice in her chest: something was very, very wrong here.

"Maintain radio discipline from here on," she ordered. "Yuki, seal check."

They moved along the hull like spiders, magnetic boots pulling them forward one step at a time. The void pressed against Elena's back, infinite and patient. Ahead, Docking Port Seven waited with its impossible preservation.

Yuki reached it first, running her scanner over the seal. "Captain, these gaskets are flexible. They shouldn't be flexible. They should be frozen solid after eight centuries of thermal cycling."

"Can you open it?"

"Yeah, that's... yeah. The mechanical override is intact." Yuki gripped the manual release wheel. It turned smoothly, resistance-free, well-maintained. "Oh, that's not right. That's really not right."

The docking port unsealed with a soft hiss that shouldn't have been possible in vacuum. Elena's training screamed at her to abort, to get back to the Persephone, to run.

Her twelve years of salvage experience overrode it. This was the find of a lifetime.

"ARIA, monitor our biometrics closely," Elena ordered. "Any anomalies, you extract us immediately."

"Confirmed, Captain."

The airlock interior was dark, but their helmet lights revealed walls that gleamed like they'd been polished yesterday. No corrosion. No degradation. The control panel beside the inner door showed a faint amber glow—power, impossibly, after eight hundred years.

Yuki's breathing came fast in Elena's ear. "Captain, I'm reading atmosphere beyond this door. Point seven bar pressure, oxygen-nitrogen mix. It's breathable."

"That's impossible."

"Yeah, but the sensors don't care about impossible."

Elena looked at the inner door's control panel. One button, softly glowing amber, waiting to be pressed. Behind it lay the Prometheus Dawn's secrets—and somewhere in those secrets was the reason this ship still ran like a machine that had never known the word 'failure.'

She pressed the button.

The inner door slid open with a whisper of hydraulics, revealing a corridor lit by emergency lighting that had stayed on for eight centuries without burning out. The air that met them was cool, recycled, maintained.

And from somewhere deep in the ship's enormous heart, Elena could have sworn she heard something humming.
