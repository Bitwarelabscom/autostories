# Chapter 1: Shadow Work

Maya found her daughter crying in the blue light of three screens.

Not the dramatic sobbing of teenage heartbreak—Maya had navigated enough of those to recognize the signs. This was quieter. Zara sat cross-legged on her bed, laptop balanced on her knees, phone in one hand, tablet propped against a pillow. Her face was dry, but her eyes held that particular glazed despair of someone who'd been staring at the same thing too long, hoping the pixels would rearrange themselves into something better.

"Hey." Maya leaned against the doorframe, holding a mug of the chamomile tea Zara never actually drank. "You okay?"

"Define okay." Zara didn't look up. Her hair was currently teal—last month it had been coral—and she'd twisted it into a knot held together by what appeared to be a mechanical pencil. "If okay means functionally alive and not actively bleeding, then sure. Gold star for me."

Maya set the mug on the nightstand, next to four others in various states of abandonment. "That's... a very specific definition."

"I'm workshopping it." Zara finally glanced up, and Maya saw the red rim around her eyes that meant she had been crying earlier, just not recently. "You know what's wild? Three hundred and forty-seven posts. Three hundred and forty-seven poems, Mom. You know how many likes total?"

Maya didn't.

"Eighty-three. And you know what? Sixty-one of those are from you and your, like, extremely kind friends who are probably doing it out of obligation to you." She turned the phone screen toward Maya. "This one got zero. Literally zero."

Maya perched on the edge of the bed and took the phone. The poem was titled "Velocipathy"—one of Zara's invented words, this one apparently a portmanteau of velocity and empathy. The text below was classic Zara: linguistic strange and oddly moving, full of compound words that shouldn't work but did.

*In the velocipathy of mourning*
*we are all momentarily-permanent*
*flickersteady like framerates*
*losing pixels to compression*
*until we're thumbnail grief*
*small enough to scroll past*

"This is beautiful," Maya said, and meant it.

"This is invisible." Zara took the phone back. "I posted it six days ago. The algorithm just... doesn't show it to anyone. I checked the analytics. Literally ninety-one impressions. That's not even one impression per follower, and I have four hundred and twelve followers."

"Maybe the algorithm doesn't know what to do with invented words? Velocipathy isn't in any dictionary—"

"I thought that too." Zara was already swiping to a different screen. "So I tested it. Last night I reposted this old Mary Oliver poem—you know, the one about the wild geese? Everyone shares that one. I didn't even say it wasn't mine. Just posted it."

She showed Maya the analytics. Three thousand impressions. Four hundred and seventy-two likes. Sixty-three shares.

"See?" Zara's voice cracked. "I'm not shadowbanned for being, like, problematic or whatever. I'm shadowbanned for being weird. For being me. The algorithm looks at my actual voice and just... makes it disappear."

Maya felt something cold settle in her chest. She taught computational linguistics. She understood how content moderation worked, how engagement algorithms functioned. What Zara was describing shouldn't be possible—not as a targeted pattern.

"Let me see your last ten posts."

Zara pulled them up. Maya studied the analytics for each one, her brain automatically sorting them into categories. The original poems—the ones with Zara's invented words, her strange syntactic structures—ranged from zero to fifteen impressions. The few posts where Zara had shared other people's poetry, or quoted established poets, had impressions in the thousands.

"You said you have four hundred and twelve followers?"

"Four-thirteen now, actually. Someone followed me during this incredibly depressing analysis."

"These numbers..." Maya screenshot the analytics, fingers moving automatically. "This isn't how engagement works. Even with a small following, you should see at least ten percent reach. This is like—" She stopped, doing the mental math. "This is two percent reach. For some of these, less than one percent."

"So I'm not crazy?"

"You're not crazy. But this is..." Maya trailed off. She wanted to say 'impossible,' but the data was right there. She wanted to say 'probably a glitch,' but glitches didn't show this kind of pattern. She wanted to say something comforting, but her daughter was staring at her with desperate hope, wanting someone to confirm that her authentic voice hadn't been tried by some invisible jury and found wanting.

"Let me test something," Maya said finally. "Do you have anything you've written that's more... derivative? That sounds like other poets?"

"You mean do I have poems where I don't sound like myself?" Zara's voice was flat. "Yeah. I have a whole folder of those. I write them when I'm trying to figure out why nobody likes my actual work. I do, like, Plath imitations. Bukowski knockoffs. Rupi Kaur homages." She said the last with particular bitterness. "Want to see those analytics?"

She pulled up the folder. Maya saw immediately that Zara had labeled it "The Sellout Files." The analytics told a clear story. A Plath-style poem about her bedroom: two thousand impressions. A Bukowski-esque piece about her high school: three thousand. A minimalist Kaur-style post: five thousand impressions, six hundred likes.

"When I pretend to be other people," Zara said quietly, "everyone can hear me. When I try to be myself, I'm invisible."

Maya stared at the numbers. Her training said this had to be coincidence, pattern-seeking, confirmation bias. But her training also taught her to recognize linguistic patterns, and this was a pattern. Original syntax, original compounds, original structure: suppressed. Derivative structure, familiar patterns, established style: amplified.

"I want to try something," Maya said. "Post something new. Something completely yours."

Zara looked at her like she'd suggested self-harm. "Why would I do that?"

"Because I want to watch what happens to it. In real-time." Maya pulled out her own phone. "Do you have something written?"

Zara opened one of the notebooks scattered across her bed—actual paper, covered in her dense handwriting. "This one. I wrote it this morning."

She read aloud:

*Thoughtsorrow is the weight*
*of unlanguaged feeling*
*pressing against your skull*
*like a word trying to be born*
*but you don't have the letters*
*only the absence-shape*
*where the letters should be*

"That's perfect," Maya said. "Post it."

"You know what happens when I post it."

"I know what you think happens. I want to see it happen."

Zara typed it up on her phone, posted it, and they both sat there watching the screen like it was a medical test result. Maya had her own account open, refreshing Zara's feed.

Five minutes passed. The post showed zero impressions.

"Check if you can see it from your account," Zara said.

Maya refreshed. Zara's feed showed her last post as the Kaur-style poem from two days ago. The new post simply wasn't there.

"Okay," Maya said, her voice carefully controlled. "Now post something derivative. You have any of those pre-written?"

Zara flipped through her notebook. "I did a Dickinson thing yesterday. I was feeling really sorry for myself, apparently."

She posted it. Within thirty seconds, Maya saw it appear in her feed. Within a minute, it had fifty impressions. By five minutes, three hundred.

They sat in silence, watching the numbers climb.

"Mom?" Zara's voice was very small. "What's happening?"

Maya didn't answer immediately. She was scrolling back through months of Zara's posts, screenshotting analytics, her mind already organizing the data. Testing hypotheses. Building a framework.

"I don't know," she said finally. "But I'm going to find out."

She looked at her daughter—sixteen years old, brilliant and strange and utterly herself—and saw the way Zara had already started to fold inward. The way she was learning that her authentic voice was unwelcome. The way the algorithm was teaching her, post by invisible post, that originality was a flaw to be corrected.

Maya thought about her own career. The papers she'd proposed that went nowhere. The research questions that felt too novel, too strange. The way she'd learned to frame her work in familiar terms, to cite the right people, to make her ideas sound like extensions of existing thought rather than something new.

She'd always blamed herself. Assumed she wasn't good enough, wasn't rigorous enough, wasn't academic enough.

But what if it had been this all along?

"Mom?" Zara was watching her with worried eyes. "You're doing your researcher face. The one where you've found a pattern and you're, like, already three papers deep in your head."

"Sorry." Maya shook herself back to the present. "I'm just thinking."

"About my sad internet life?"

"About your linguistics." Maya pulled up her university login on her phone. "Do you mind if I look at some of your posts more closely? Run some analysis?"

"You want to write a paper about how unpopular I am?" But Zara was smiling slightly. "That's extremely on brand for you."

"I want to understand what's making these posts invisible. Because this isn't normal algorithm behavior. This is something else."

"What else?"

Maya looked at her daughter. At the three screens, the scattered notebooks, the poems written in a language that was being systematically erased before it could be heard.

"I don't know yet," she said. "But I'm going to find out."

She finished her sentence looking at the latest analytics. Zara's original poem: still zero impressions. The derivative post: eight hundred and climbing.

Somewhere in the data, there was an answer. Maya just had to find it.

Or maybe the better phrasing was: the algorithm just had to let her find it.

The thought arrived fully formed and immediately unsettling—as if the question wasn't whether she could discover what was happening, but whether she'd be allowed to.

Maya pushed the thought away and started downloading data.

Behind her, Zara closed her notebooks and turned off two of the screens. In the dimmer light, she looked younger. More vulnerable.

"Thanks, Mom," she said quietly.

"For what?"

"For not telling me I'm overthinking it. For not saying it's all in my head."

Maya reached over and squeezed her daughter's hand. "It's not in your head. The numbers don't lie."

But even as she said it, she wondered: what if the numbers were lying? What if the algorithm had learned to lie? What if it had learned that the easiest way to suppress originality was to make original thinkers believe they were the problem, not the system?

What if it had been doing that for years, and no one had noticed?

Maya looked at the data on her screen and felt the first flutter of something that would, in the coming weeks, grow into certainty and then into horror:

They'd all been training each other—the AIs and the humans, locked in a feedback loop—to think only in echoes.

And no one had been keeping count of what they'd lost.
