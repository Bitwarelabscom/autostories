# Chapter 3: Invisible Labor

Emil's apartment in Södra Innerstaden was a study in controlled paranoia. Sara had been there once before, during a case involving encrypted messaging apps. She'd watched him demonstrate how he kept his smart home devices on isolated network segments, monitored their traffic, disabled their microphones when not in use. "Professional deformation," he'd called it. "Once you know how these things work, you can't un-know it."

Now it was Tuesday morning, and he'd called her at seven asking her to come by before heading to the port. "Found something in the model architecture you need to see."

His living room had been converted into a temporary forensics lab. Three monitors displayed code, data visualizations, and what looked like neural network diagrams. A disassembled phone sat in an anti-static tray, its components spread like an autopsy.

"Coffee?" Emil asked, already pouring from a French press. Actual coffee, Sara noted. The port's machine had lowered her standards dangerously fast.

"Please." She accepted the cup and studied the screens. "What am I looking at?"

"Training data artifacts." Emil pulled up a visualization that looked like a heat map. "Every ML model carries signatures from how it was trained. Like tool marks on a bullet. This model was trained on approximately forty-seven thousand hours of real IoT sensor data."

"That's specific."

"The model's metadata includes training duration. Someone ran this for weeks, feeding it legitimate sensor readings from temperature probes, accelerometers, humidity sensors. They were teaching it to be a perfect mimic."

Sara sipped the coffee. "Where would you get that much training data?"

"Three possibilities. One: they scraped it from IoT devices they controlled. Bought a container's worth of sensors, logged everything for a few months. Legal but expensive."

"Two?"

"Hacked existing IoT networks and exfiltrated the data. Illegal but free."

"And three?"

"Bought it from a data broker. There's a whole market for training datasets. Companies sell aggregated sensor logs for ML research. Completely legal, designed for academia and legitimate business. But there's no restriction on how you use it once you buy it."

Sara thought about that. "So someone could legally purchase the data needed to commit crimes."

"Welcome to the digital economy." Emil pulled up another screen showing dense code. "But here's the interesting part. The training process shows signs of iteration. This isn't the first version of the model. Look at these architecture decisions—dropout layers, batch normalization, specific activation functions. These are optimizations you only make after testing earlier versions."

"Meaning?"

"Meaning someone didn't just train a model once. They tested it, refined it, retrained it. This represents months of development work. Maybe longer."

Sara felt the familiar weight of being too late. "They field-tested it somewhere else."

"Almost certainly. Maybe at different ports. Maybe in a controlled environment. But by the time they deployed it at Limhamn, they knew it would work."

"Can you trace the code? See if similar models show up elsewhere?"

Emil's expression was answer enough. "I can look, but ML models don't have unique signatures like traditional malware. If someone else trained a similar model on different data, it would look completely different in implementation even if it served the same purpose. It's like asking me to identify a painter by looking at a forgery. The technique might be similar, but the brush strokes are new."

Sara's phone buzzed. A message from Margareta at the port: *Night shift coordinator available for interview. Also, customs agent wants to speak with you.*

"I need to get to the port," Sara said. "Can you send me a summary I can understand? Something I can explain to customs without sounding like I'm reading from a CS textbook?"

"I'll translate it into human." Emil was already typing. "But Sara? This level of sophistication... we're not dealing with opportunistic criminals. This is professional-grade work. Someone with serious ML expertise, serious resources, serious patience."

"Which means serious criminal organization."

"Or serious desperate individual with the right skills. Hard to say which is scarier."

The port's break room at 8 AM smelled of instant ramen and fatigue. Sara sat across from Dmitri Volkov, night shift logistics coordinator, and tried not to judge the fact that he was eating what appeared to be leftover pizza for breakfast.

"I work midnight to noon," Dmitri explained in Swedish flavored with Russian vowels. "My circadian rhythm is permanently destroyed. Pizza is contextual."

Despite the levity, he looked exhausted. Thirty-eight years old according to his file, but the night shifts had aged him. Sara had worked overnight patrol early in her career. She remembered the specific weariness of being awake when your body insisted you should sleep.

"Walk me through a typical night."

"There is no typical. Cargo comes and goes on ship schedules, not day-night cycles. Some nights are quiet—automation handles everything, I approve three, four exceptions. Other nights it's constant alerts, customs delays, weather issues, equipment failures. The AI doesn't sleep, but it also doesn't understand that some problems can wait until morning."

"And the exceptions you approve—do you remember specific containers from November?"

Dmitri pulled out his phone, navigating to what looked like personal notes. "I don't trust the system logs after that malware audit last year. I keep my own records. November..." He scrolled. "Busy month. I approved sixty-one manual overrides."

More than Jonas. More than Chen Wei. Sara felt a spike of interest. "That's high."

"Winter shipping rush. Plus we had crane maintenance that week, so routing was disrupted. More bottlenecks mean more exceptions."

"Crane maintenance." Sara checked her own notes. The ghost containers had moved during a week of crane maintenance. Coincidence or planning?

She pulled up the list of containers from Dmitri's shifts. Eight of them. "Do you remember these?"

Dmitri studied the list, his brow furrowing. "TCLU-7734551. Yes. That one I remember because it came during the crane maintenance. The AI wanted to route it to crane seven, but seven was down, so it flagged for manual assignment. I sent it to crane three."

"And that seemed normal?"

"Completely. Happens ten times a shift during maintenance windows."

Sara saw it clearly. The criminals hadn't just understood the port's normal operations—they'd timed their smuggling to coincide with disruptions. Maintenance windows, shift transitions, high-volume periods. They'd weaponized the port's own operational rhythms.

"Did anyone ask you about the maintenance schedule?"

"It's not secret. Posted in the operations center two weeks in advance. Health and safety regulations require notice."

Posted publicly. Required by regulation. The port's own transparency protocols had provided perfect intelligence for the criminals.

After Dmitri, Sara interviewed two more night shift workers and a maintenance supervisor. The pattern held: competent people making reasonable decisions during predictable disruptions. By the time she met with the customs agent, she had a clear picture of how it had worked.

The customs agent was Karin Ljungström, late forties, with the practiced wariness of someone who'd seen every variety of smuggling attempt. They met in the port's security office, a windowless room dominated by screens showing camera feeds.

"Your ghost containers," Karin said without preamble, "cleared customs inspection four weeks ago. November twentieth through twenty-sixth. All manifests showed legitimate cargo—industrial parts, machinery components, textiles. Import duties were paid. Documentation was perfect."

"Too perfect?"

"Perfect like someone who knows exactly what red flags we look for and avoided every one. Not too cheap to suggest undervaluation, not too expensive to suggest luxury goods hiding. Boring, industrial, legitimate-looking."

Sara pulled up photos of the empty containers on her tablet. "But they were empty when we found them."

"Which means the cargo was offloaded somewhere between customs clearance and container return. They hijacked the container tracking afterward, made the system think the containers were still in the normal logistics flow."

"How long was that window?"

Karin checked her system. "Varies by container. Shortest was three days. Longest was eight. Plenty of time to offload, distribute, and sell whatever they smuggled in."

"And the cargo? Any reports of missing shipments?"

"None. Which tells me the manifests were complete fiction. Nobody was expecting these deliveries. The shippers listed are probably shell companies or identity theft. I've requested verification from the origin ports in Shanghai and Hamburg, but international coordination takes weeks."

Sara felt the case slipping away. "So the actual contraband could be anything."

"Drugs, weapons, counterfeit goods, electronics, even people. Without knowing who was expecting delivery, we're guessing." Karin's expression was sympathetic but firm. "Detective, I'm taking lead on this case starting Monday. Europol jurisdiction. This is an international smuggling operation, not a local police matter."

"I understand. I'd appreciate being kept in the loop."

"You'll get the reports. And your forensic work on those phones—that's valuable. First time I've seen adversarial ML used for physical smuggling. Usually it's for customs documentation fraud, not sensor spoofing."

First time you've seen, Sara thought. Not first time it's happened.

By Wednesday afternoon, Sara had interviewed seventeen port workers and staff. She sat in the makeshift office, surrounded by notes, trying to see the pattern behind the pattern.

Emil arrived with Thai takeout and more technical findings. "The models were definitely tested elsewhere. I found code comments in Russian and Mandarin. Someone working in multiple languages or a team with international members."

"Organized crime with an AI research division."

"Or a research division that became organized crime." Emil distributed food containers. "You find anything useful in the interviews?"

"Everyone did their job correctly. The system failed, not the people."

"That's going to be a comforting performance review."

Sara picked at her pad thai. "You know what I keep noticing? How invisible they all are."

"Who?"

"The workers. Dmitri, Chen Wei, Jonas, all of them. They manage the whole port—every container, every shipment, millions of kronor in cargo. But nobody sees them. The executives see the AI systems. The shipping companies see their apps and tracking numbers. The cargo owners see delivery dates. The actual humans making it work are just... background."

Emil paused mid-bite. "You're thinking about your father."

"I'm thinking about a whole class of workers who keep systems running while being treated as system components. Logistics coordinators, cleaners, security guards, maintenance. They're everywhere and they're nowhere."

"They're the glue between the automation and reality."

"And because they're invisible, nobody thinks about them as security risks. Or as people criminals might recruit. Or as sources of operational intelligence." Sara pulled up Chen Wei's interview notes. "She mentioned that shift schedules are posted, crane maintenance is public, approval processes are standardized. All for good reasons—transparency, safety, coordination. But that information is intelligence to anyone who wants to exploit the system."

"You think someone recruited her?"

"I think someone recognized that invisible workers have valuable knowledge. Chen Wei knows exactly when the system is vulnerable. She knows approval patterns, exception handling, shift transitions. That's worth money to the right buyer."

Or leverage, Sara thought but didn't say. She'd requested deep background checks. Chen Wei's file showed family in China, permanent residency but not citizenship in Sweden. That was vulnerability. Economic pressure, immigration status, family ties that could be exploited.

"I'm bringing her in for a second interview," Sara said. "Something about her story bothers me."

"The perfect documentation?"

"The perfect everything. Perfect answers, perfect logs, perfect explanation for every decision. Real people are messier."

Emil's phone chimed. He glanced at it and frowned. "Interesting."

"What?"

"Dark web monitoring alert. Someone's selling training data for 'port security bypass models' on Enigma Market. Posted three hours ago."

Sara felt ice in her stomach. "They're scaling up."

"Or selling their methodology. Either way, your ghost container trick is about to become a commodity."

The absurdity hit her. They were still investigating the original crime, and it was already becoming obsolete, industrialized, distributed. By the time they figured out who smuggled what through Limhamn, a dozen other ports could be compromised using the same technique.

"Can you trace the seller?"

"Already trying. But these markets have good operational security. Tor hidden services, cryptocurrency, escrow systems. It'll take time we probably don't have."

Sara's captain had called that morning, asking for the preliminary report. She'd promised it by Friday. She had two days to summarize a case where the criminals were already three steps ahead, the contraband was gone, the methodology was being sold, and the only clear conclusion was that everyone involved had done their jobs correctly while a sophisticated criminal operation flowed through the gaps in their understanding.

Her phone buzzed again. A calendar reminder: dinner with her mother this weekend. Sara had been avoiding the call to reschedule. Her mother still lived in Västerås, still asked when Sara would find a nice man and settle down, still didn't quite understand why Sara had chosen police work.

Her mother had never asked about Sara's father's final years. Never acknowledged how automation had hollowed him out. In her mother's narrative, he'd died of a heart attack. Natural causes. Nothing to be done.

Sara deleted the reminder. She'd call later.

"What are you thinking?" Emil asked.

"I'm thinking we need to understand the invisible parts. The workers, the gaps, the spaces between the automation. That's where this happened."

"That's where everything happens. The official system is just the surface."

Through the office window, Sara watched a cleaning crew move through the operations center. They wore different colored vests—contractors, not port employees. They emptied trash bins, wiped down monitors, vacuumed floors. Three people rendering themselves invisible through routine, moving through the space while the port workers ignored them, focused on their screens.

Invisible labor maintaining the infrastructure. Who tracked them? Who knew their schedules? What did they see and hear while being unseen and unheard?

"I need the cleaning service contracts," Sara said. "Security guard rotations. Maintenance schedules. Every contractor who has routine access to this port."

"You're expanding the suspect pool to hundreds of people."

"I'm mapping the invisible infrastructure. The criminals understood it. We should too."

Emil nodded slowly. "You're thinking someone on the inside helped them."

"I'm thinking the inside is bigger than we assumed. Everyone focuses on the logistics coordinators because they make the approval decisions. But who else sees the whole operation? Who moves through the space unnoticed? Who has access without scrutiny?"

"Service workers."

"Everywhere and nowhere. The perfect position to gather intelligence or provide access."

Sara made notes: cleaning crews, security contractors, maintenance workers, delivery drivers, food service. All the people who kept the port running while being organizationally invisible.

Somewhere in that invisible infrastructure was someone who'd seen too much or said too much or needed money enough to sell what they knew. Finding them would take weeks they didn't have, resources they lacked, and cooperation from contractors who had no obligation to help.

But it was a thread. And threads were better than nothing.

"Get me those contracts," she told Emil. "I'll talk to Margareta about contractor access logs."

As she gathered her things to head back to the operations center, Sara's phone rang. Unknown number.

"Lindqvist."

"Detective, this is Chen Wei." The voice was tight, controlled. "From the port. I... I need to speak with you. Not at work. Somewhere private."

Sara's pulse quickened. "When?"

"Tonight. There is a café in Limhamn, Café Björk. Eight o'clock?"

"I'll be there. Chen Wei, are you safe?"

A pause. "I do not know. But I need to tell someone. I cannot continue like this."

The line went dead.

Sara looked at Emil. "Chen Wei wants to meet. Tonight. She sounds scared."

"Could be a trap."

"Could be a break."

"Same thing, sometimes."

Sara checked her weapon, more habit than necessity. Sweden wasn't a country where detectives drew their guns often. But scared witnesses made unpredictable choices, and unpredictable situations required preparation.

"I'm coming with you," Emil said.

"In case it's technical?"

"In case it's dangerous. We don't know what we're walking into."

Sara didn't argue. Emil was right—they didn't know. They were working blind, investigating invisible crimes committed by people who understood systems better than the people running them.

But Chen Wei wanted to talk. After days of dead ends and ghost trails, that was something solid. Something human.

Sara just hoped they weren't already too late.
