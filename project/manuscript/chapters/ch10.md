# Chapter 10

Captain Thomas Walsh had the kind of face that looked like it had been carved from New England granite—all hard angles and weathered creases. He'd been with Boston PD for thirty-two years, running Homicide for the last eight, and he had a particular expression he used when he was about to tell you something you didn't want to hear.

He was wearing that expression now.

"Marcus, I need you to walk me through this one more time." Walsh leaned back in his chair, hands folded across his chest. "Because what I'm hearing sounds like a theory, not a case."

Reeves stood at the small whiteboard he'd commandeered for Walsh's office, marker in hand, surrounded by the evidence of twelve days of obsessive investigation. Timeline charts. Background reports. Chemical order records. Everything that should add up to murder but somehow didn't.

"Professor Jonathan Sterling died twelve days ago," Reeves began, keeping his voice level. "Official cause: cardiac arrest, natural causes. But—"

"But you don't believe it." Walsh's tone was neutral, not dismissive but not encouraging either.

"I don't believe it because the evidence doesn't support it." Reeves tapped the autopsy report pinned to the board. "Dr. Chen found hypoxic cell damage inconsistent with simple cardiac arrest. That damage suggests oxygen deprivation at the cellular level, which isn't explained by a heart attack."

"Chen's report says the damage is minor and could have multiple explanations," Walsh countered. "I read it. She used the words 'possibly consistent with' about six times. That's not definitive."

"No, but combined with everything else—" Reeves moved to the next section of the board. "Sterling had fifteen confirmed enemies. Former students whose careers he systematically destroyed. Dr. Olivia Harrington is one of them. Three months before his death, she borrowed a book from his library titled 'The Art of Quiet Death'—a historical text about undetectable poisons. That book is now missing."

"Circumstantial," Walsh said. "And the book could be anywhere. Maybe Sterling misplaced it. Maybe it was donated. Maybe it never made it back to the shelf in the first place."

"Harrington visited Sterling three days before his death. Alone. She claims she was returning the book, but Victoria Sterling never saw it. That visit timing matches perfectly with the administration of a delayed-release poison."

Walsh sat forward. "Except there's no poison, Marcus. Chen tested for everything. Tox screen came back clean. You're building a case around a murder weapon that doesn't exist."

"It exists. It's just undetectable." Reeves pulled up the research he and Dr. Chen had compiled. "Synthetic cardiac glycosides, designed to induce arrest and degrade within seventy-two hours. Chen identified the theoretical class. I've been tracking Harrington's chemical orders from her lab at Mass General. Six months ago, she ordered compounds consistent with glycoside synthesis. Digitoxin derivatives, potassium-channel modulators, lipid-soluble carriers—"

"Did she order a kit labeled 'murder poison ingredients'?" Walsh's voice had an edge now. "Because unless she did, those orders prove nothing. She's a cardiac pharmacologist. Of course she orders cardiac compounds. That's her job."

Reeves felt his jaw tighten. "The pattern of orders changed six months ago. Before that, standard research materials. After, highly specific compounds with no apparent connection to her published research. I checked her publication list—nothing in the last year requires those particular chemicals."

"So she's working on something new. Something unpublished." Walsh stood, moved to the window. Outside, Boston churned through another gray March day. "Marcus, I'm not saying you're wrong about your instincts. But instincts aren't warrants. They're not prosecution. Hell, they're barely probable cause."

"What about motive?" Reeves pressed. "Harrington's mother died of ALS eight years ago. Slow, painful, no cure. Harrington had to watch her suffer for eighteen months, completely helpless despite being a doctor. After that, she got involved with right-to-die advocacy groups. Organizations that support assisted suicide for the terminally ill."

"Which is legal in half a dozen states and supported by plenty of reasonable people who aren't murderers."

"But it shows a philosophy. A belief that death can be merciful. That ending suffering justifies—"

"Justifies what?" Walsh turned from the window, his expression harder now. "Justifies murder? You think because Harrington supports assisted dying for terminal patients, she'd kill a healthy man? That's a hell of a leap."

"He wasn't healthy. He was toxic. He was destroying lives, Captain. Systematically ruining careers, causing genuine suffering to dozens of people. If you believed suffering should be prevented, if you had the knowledge and means to stop someone from causing more damage—"

"Then you'd call the police. Or a lawyer. Or a journalist." Walsh crossed his arms. "You wouldn't synthesize an undetectable poison and commit the perfect murder, Marcus, because you're a doctor who took an oath to do no harm. The mental gymnastics you're asking me to believe—that a respected cardiologist would kill someone out of some twisted sense of mercy—that's not a case. That's a philosophy seminar."

Reeves forced himself to breathe. Walsh wasn't wrong. Every point he'd just made was logical, defensible. It was why the DA had refused to issue search warrants. Why Chen kept qualifying every statement with "possibly" and "consistent with." Why Ethan's careful documentation of Harrington's changed behavior after her mother's death proved exactly nothing in legal terms.

"What about the alibi?" Reeves tried a different angle. "Harrington was at a medical conference in New York City the day Sterling died. Three hundred witnesses place her there. But if she administered a delayed-release poison three days earlier—"

"If. If. If." Walsh's voice rose. "If she created this theoretical poison. If she administered it during her visit. If it worked exactly as planned. If Sterling didn't notice being injected with something. If the poison degraded perfectly so Chen couldn't detect it. That's about six 'ifs' too many for the DA's office, and you know it."

"So we just close the case? Rule it natural causes and let her walk?"

"We close it because it *is* natural causes, Marcus. According to every piece of forensic evidence we have. According to the medical examiner's official report. According to everything except your gut feeling that something's wrong."

Reeves stared at the whiteboard, at the web of connections that should prove murder but didn't. Twelve days of work. Hundreds of hours. Background checks, chemical analyses, timeline reconstructions, motive documentation. All of it pointing to one conclusion he couldn't prove.

"She's avoiding Victoria Sterling," he said, hearing the desperation creep into his voice. "She was close with both of them for twenty years, but she hasn't called, hasn't written, hasn't acknowledged the death at all. That's guilt, Captain. That's someone who can't face what they've done."

"Or it's grief. Or it's being busy. Or it's any of a hundred other explanations that don't involve murder." Walsh moved to his desk, pulled out a file. "I got a call from Commissioner Hayes yesterday. He wanted to know why we're still working a natural death case when we've got three actual homicides that need attention. A drive-by in Roxbury, a domestic in Dorchester, and a gang killing in Mattapan. Three cases with actual victims, actual evidence, and actual chances of prosecution. That's where I need you, Marcus."

"Two more weeks," Reeves said. "Give me two more weeks to follow up on the chemical orders, to—"

"To what? You've been following up for twelve days. What's going to change in fourteen more?" Walsh's expression softened slightly. "Look, I get it. This case feels wrong to you. And maybe you're right. Maybe Dr. Olivia Harrington is a brilliant killer who committed the perfect crime. But even if she is, we can't prove it. And at some point, we have to accept that justice has limits."

"Justice has limits when we give up."

"No. Justice has limits when the evidence runs out." Walsh opened the file, revealing the three active cases he'd mentioned. Photos of actual crime scenes, actual bodies, actual evidence that could actually be prosecuted. "I'm reassigning you tomorrow. Sterling case gets filed under suspicious but unproven. If new evidence emerges, we reopen. Until then, it's done."

The words hit like a physical blow. Done. Over. Closed. Webb's case all over again—the detective who knew the truth but couldn't prove it, who watched a killer walk free because knowledge wasn't the same as evidence.

"Captain—"

"It's done, Marcus." Walsh's voice was firm but not unkind. "I'm sorry. I know you put everything into this. But sometimes the bad guys win. Sometimes perfect crimes stay perfect. And we have to live with that and move on to the cases we *can* solve."

Reeves gathered his files mechanically, removing them from Walsh's whiteboard. Twelve days of investigation condensed back into a stack of papers that proved nothing. He walked back to his desk in a fog, barely registering Ethan's concerned look as he passed.

At his desk, he sat staring at the Sterling file. All those destroyed careers. All that suffering. And somewhere in Boston, Olivia Harrington was saving lives at Mass General, going about her day, believing she'd gotten away with it.

Maybe she had.

His phone buzzed. Dr. Chen.

"I heard Walsh closed the case," she said without preamble. "I'm sorry, Marcus."

"You were right. Could-be isn't proof."

"For what it's worth, I think you were onto something. That hypoxic damage still bothers me. It's consistent with the theoretical glycoside mechanism."

"Consistent with. Possibly explained by. Might suggest." Reeves rubbed his eyes. "I'm tired of maybes, Lisa."

"I know." A pause. "What will you do?"

"What Walsh ordered. Move on. Work cases I can actually solve." The words tasted like ash.

After they hung up, Reeves sat alone at his desk as the office emptied around him. Five-thirty became six, became seven. The case file sat in front of him, a monument to failure.

He thought about Webb. About sitting in his mentor's apartment after they'd ruled it suicide, knowing it was murder, unable to prove it. About the weight of that knowledge, how it had consumed Webb until there was nothing left but despair.

Was he heading down the same path? Obsessing over an unprovable crime while the world moved on? Walsh was right about one thing—there were actual cases that needed attention. Cases with evidence, witnesses, reasonable chances of justice.

But letting this go felt like surrender. Felt like admitting that intelligence could triumph over truth, that perfection was possible, that some murders were meant to stay hidden.

His phone buzzed. Ethan.

*Sorry about the case. Let me know if you need anything.*

Reeves typed back: *Thanks. Get some rest.*

But he knew Ethan wouldn't. Just like he knew he wouldn't either. They'd both keep thinking about it, worrying at it like a loose tooth. The case that felt wrong, that smelled like murder despite everything pointing to natural causes.

Maybe that was the real punishment. Not that Harrington would walk free, but that they'd always know and never prove it. That the perfect crime wasn't one without evidence—it was one where the evidence existed but couldn't be found, where the truth was just out of reach, where justice had limits.

Reeves closed the Sterling file and locked it in his desk drawer. Tomorrow he'd start on the Roxbury drive-by. Real work. Solvable work.

Tonight, he'd go home and try to sleep and fail, because his mind would keep circling back to the same questions: What did I miss? What detail slipped past me? Where did I fail?

And somewhere in Boston, Olivia Harrington would sleep peacefully, secure in the knowledge that she'd committed the perfect murder.

Maybe she had.

Maybe perfect was possible after all.

The thought made him feel hollow as he gathered his coat and headed for the door, leaving behind the empty office and the unsolved case and the uncomfortable truth that sometimes, despite everything you know and everything you believe, the bad guys win.

Justice had limits.

And tonight, Marcus Reeves had found them.
