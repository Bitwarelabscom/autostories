# Chapter 10: Access Points

Markus Westerberg's penthouse in Turning Torso occupied the kind of space that appeared in architecture magazines—floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking Öresund, minimalist furniture, smart home controls embedded in every wall. The morning light made everything look like a render, too perfect to be real.

"I don't understand how they got in," Westerberg said for the third time. He was fifty-something, tech executive, the kind of wealthy that came from being early to the right startup. "The building security is state of the art. Facial recognition on entry, smart locks on every door, access logs for every resident and visitor. The system showed nothing unusual."

Sara stood in the living room where the burglars had carefully removed a Hilma af Klint painting worth six hundred thousand kronor. No broken glass, no damaged frame. Professional work.

"Tell me about your building's service providers," she said.

"Service providers?"

"Cleaning, maintenance, deliveries. Anyone who has regular access to the building."

Westerberg pulled up his building's app on his phone. "We use SweClean AB for weekly cleaning. Building maintenance is handled by FacilityTech. I have grocery deliveries from MatHem, but they just leave packages in the lobby. Oh, and there's the plant service—someone comes every other week for the terrace garden."

Sara wrote down each name. "And these services have access codes? Keys?"

"Smart access, actually. The building manager grants temporary credentials tied to their service schedules. So the cleaning service can only unlock doors during their scheduled windows, that sort of thing. It's all automated."

"Managed by SecureWatch?"

"I think so, yes. Same company that does the security systems."

Sara felt the pattern clicking into place. SecureWatch again. The same vulnerability, different context. Whoever was behind this understood the system architecture well enough to exploit it across multiple deployment scenarios.

"Have you noticed anyone unusual? Service workers who seemed particularly interested in your valuables, who asked questions about your schedule?"

"My cleaner is very professional," Westerberg said defensively. "She's been with SweClean for years. I doubt she'd—"

"I'm not accusing anyone," Sara said gently. "I'm trying to understand how the security was bypassed. If someone could predict when you'd be away, when service workers would have legitimate access, they could time an entry to look completely normal to the building's algorithms."

Westerberg processed this slowly. "You're saying someone made themselves invisible by looking like they belonged?"

"Exactly."

He sat down heavily on his minimalist couch. "I pay fifty thousand kronor a month for this apartment specifically because it's supposed to be secure. Smart building, AI-powered security, the future of urban living. And you're telling me that's what made it vulnerable?"

Sara didn't answer directly. What was there to say? That every optimization created a new attack surface? That the smarter the building, the more ways there were to exploit it? That the future Westerberg had paid for was also a weapon for those smart enough to understand it?

The pattern held across all seven victims. Emma Lundström in Västra Hamnen: jewelry worth two hundred thousand kronor, missing during her weekend away. Building access logs showed only scheduled service worker entries. Lisa Holm, also Västra Hamnen: electronics and cash, taken during a service window. Jakob Persson, Turning Torso: watches, art, and documents—the documents bothered Sara most, suggested the thieves were selecting targets, not just grabbing valuables.

Every victim used multiple service companies. Every building used SecureWatch access control. Every burglary occurred during legitimate service windows when the building's algorithms expected people to be entering apartments.

By afternoon, Sara had a list of twelve service companies that had access to the burgled apartments. She cross-referenced: SweClean AB appeared on six of the seven victim lists. FacilityTech on five. MatHem deliveries on all seven, but they only accessed lobbies.

SweClean AB. She called Emil from her car, parked outside Lisa Holm's building.

"I need everything you can find on SweClean AB. Cleaning service, operates across Malmö's smart buildings. They have access credentials to every victim."

"You think the cleaners are the burglars?"

"I think someone with access to the cleaning company's credentials and schedules could predict exactly when and where to be invisible," Sara said. "Can you check their systems for breaches?"

"I can try. But Sara, most service companies have terrible cybersecurity. Their employees use personal phones, share passwords, rarely update software. If someone wanted to compromise them, it wouldn't take sophisticated tools."

Of course not. The vulnerable point wasn't the smart building security—it was the human infrastructure that the security depended on. Service workers as access points. The same people economically marginalized enough to need the work were also information-rich enough to be valuable targets for exploitation.

Or, Sara thought uncomfortably, vulnerable enough to do the exploiting themselves.

The budget meeting at four PM was exactly as frustrating as Sara expected. Captain Lindberg presided from the head of the conference table, flanked by representatives from three other divisions—Property Crime, Organized Crime, and the National Cybercrime Center.

"Seven burglaries isn't enough to justify specialized resources," Lindberg said, reviewing Sara's request. "Property Crime should be handling this."

"It's not traditional property crime," Sara said, keeping her voice level. "It's algorithmic exploitation of smart building security systems. The same methodology we've seen in the pharmacy robberies and potentially connected to the port smuggling case. This is Economic Crime's jurisdiction."

The Property Crime representative—a veteran detective named Svensson—crossed his arms. "Burglary is burglary. You're overcomplicating it."

"The burglars bypass security without forced entry by manipulating access control algorithms," Emil said from his seat next to Sara. He'd brought his laptop, prepared for exactly this resistance. "They exploit service worker credentials and schedule prediction to make themselves invisible to the building's AI. That's not lock-picking. That's adversarial machine learning."

"So teach us how to investigate it," Svensson said. "We don't need Economic Crime stepping on our jurisdiction."

"You need someone who understands the technical methodology," Sara said. "These aren't isolated crimes. They're part of an ecosystem of algorithmic exploitation we're tracking across multiple case types. If we don't investigate them holistically, we'll miss the connections."

"Connections you haven't proven yet," the National Cybercrime representative pointed out. "You have pharmacy robberies that might be connected to a dark web vendor. You have burglaries that might use similar tools. But you don't have evidence they're coordinated."

"Because we need resources to investigate," Sara said, frustration bleeding through despite her best efforts. "More analysts, access to service company databases, cooperation with—"

"The answer is no," Lindberg said. "Economic Crime can continue investigating the pharmacy cases. Property Crime will handle the burglaries. If you find concrete evidence of coordination, we'll reconsider resource allocation. Until then, work with what you have."

Sara wanted to argue that "what they had" was two investigators against an exponentially reproducing criminal ecosystem, that by the time they found concrete evidence there would be twenty more crimes, that the bureaucratic divisions were exactly what the criminals were exploiting—different divisions, different jurisdictions, different priorities, no holistic view.

But she knew institutional battles when she saw them. This one was already lost.

"Understood," she said.

Back in Emil's lab, Sara paced while Emil ran searches on SweClean AB's corporate records.

"Jurisdictional bullshit," she muttered. "They can't see that this is systemic because they're too busy protecting their turf."

"Welcome to law enforcement," Emil said without looking up from his screens. "Twenty divisions, zero coordination. Meanwhile the criminals are teaching each other, sharing tools, building networks across case types."

His monitors displayed SweClean AB's business registration, employee records, client lists. A medium-sized cleaning company, forty employees, contracts with most of Malmö's high-end residential buildings. Owned and operated by Katarina Ek, forty-six, registered business address in Limhamn.

"Can you access their scheduling system?" Sara asked.

"Not legally, not without a warrant. And getting a warrant requires proving they're involved in crime, which requires evidence we don't have yet." Emil opened another screen. "But I can look at their public information, employee LinkedIn profiles, business reviews."

He pulled up employee photos from the company website. Mostly women, various ages, immigrant backgrounds represented. Standard service industry demographics—the people who cleaned wealthy apartments while living in less wealthy neighborhoods, who generated data exhaust while barely making rent.

"I need to interview Katarina Ek," Sara said. "As a witness, not a suspect. Ask about her security protocols, whether she's noticed anything unusual, whether any clients have reported issues."

"And see if she's nervous," Emil said.

"And see if she's nervous."

Emil's phone buzzed. He glanced at it, then sat up straighter. "Sara. The port case team just sent their updated analysis. They've identified a person of interest in the container smuggling."

"Who?"

"Chen Wei. Port worker, logistics coordinator. Her access credentials match the timing of the ghost container manipulations. She had the knowledge and the access to upload the false IoT signatures."

Sara felt the pieces moving. Port smuggling, pharmacy robberies, apartment burglaries. Different crimes, different perpetrators, but similar methodologies. Service workers and port employees—people with access, people with economic pressure, people who understood the systems they were embedded in.

An ecosystem. Not a conspiracy, but parallel evolution. Different people discovering independently that algorithmic systems were vulnerable, that their access was capital, that their marginalization gave them nothing to lose.

"Is Chen Wei under arrest?"

"Not yet. They're building the case. But Sara—" Emil turned his laptop so she could see the analysis. "—Chen Wei's digital trail shows dark web forum activity. Same communities where NullGradient and Adversary post. She might be part of the same network."

"Or another student," Sara said quietly. "Learning the same techniques, applying them to her specific access point. Someone taught her."

"NullGradient."

"Or Adversary. Or someone else we haven't identified yet." Sara studied the data, the web of connections forming across cases. "How many people are in this network? How many have been taught these techniques?"

"Unknown. Dozens, maybe hundreds. The forums are semi-public. The tools are downloadable. The ideology—" Emil pulled up forum posts "—is explicitly about teaching. Spreading knowledge as resistance."

Sara read one of Adversary's posts: "Every person who learns to see algorithmic systems becomes ungovernable. Every exploit we share is an act of collective liberation. They built the surveillance infrastructure to control us. We're teaching each other to control it instead."

Liberation or crime? Resistance or theft? Sara genuinely wasn't sure where the line was anymore.

What she did know was that prosecuting individual cases wouldn't stop this. You couldn't arrest your way out of an ideological movement, especially one that offered economic survival to marginalized communities.

But she could try to understand it. Map it. Document the scope. And maybe, eventually, push for the systemic changes that would address the underlying causes rather than just the symptoms.

"I'm going to talk to Katarina Ek tomorrow," Sara said. "Gentle approach, witness interview. See if she's willing to talk about her security practices, her employees, her clients."

"And if she's part of this?"

"Then we'll know we're looking at service workers across sectors. Not just one company, one person, but a whole class of people who've learned to weaponize their access." Sara gathered her notes. "Which means the problem is so much bigger than seven burglaries."

Emil nodded slowly. "Economic Crime, Property Crime, Organized Crime, Cybercrime—none of our divisions are set up for this. We're trying to fight an ecosystem with tools designed for individual perpetrators."

"I know."

"So what do we do?"

Sara thought of Rosengård, of the community center receptionist's resignation, of the man in the café who might be NullGradient or might be just another skilled person locked out of legitimate opportunity. She thought of her father, automated out of existence. She thought of Chen Wei, desperate enough to smuggle. She thought of service workers carrying data exhaust worth more than their wages.

"We do what we can," she said finally. "Document everything. Build the cases even if they're hard to prosecute. Connect the patterns even if the institution can't see them yet. And hope that eventually, someone with power decides to fix the systems instead of just punishing the people the systems failed."

It wasn't much. But it was all she had.

---

That night, Sara read through the service worker employment statistics Emil had compiled. Average wages barely above poverty line. High turnover, minimal benefits, no job security. Access to millions of kronor in property, but barely enough income to cover their own rent.

And now, someone was teaching them that their access was capital. That the data exhaust they generated—schedules, routines, building access patterns—was worth money. That the systems designed to optimize them out of existence could be turned into weapons.

Sara couldn't blame them. She wanted to, because blame would make the investigation simpler. But she couldn't.

Her father hadn't fought back. These people were. And that made them criminals by law, but sympathetic by circumstance.

Tomorrow she'd interview Katarina Ek. Tomorrow she'd try to find the thread connecting service workers to dark web teachers to algorithmic exploitation. Tomorrow she'd keep building the case.

But tonight, she just felt the weight of knowing that every arrest would reveal ten more people with the same skills, the same motivations, the same vulnerability to economic pressure and access to technological exploitation.

The ecosystem was growing faster than she could map it. And the institution she worked for was too fractured to respond effectively.

Still. Someone had to try.

Sara closed her laptop and went to bed, knowing tomorrow would bring more jurisdictional battles, more evidence of systemic failure, more proof that the smart city generated its own vulnerabilities as fast as it optimized itself.

The future was algorithmic. And algorithms, it turned out, cut both ways.
