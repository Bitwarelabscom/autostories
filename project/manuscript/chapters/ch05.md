# Chapter 5: Predictable Patterns

Monday morning arrived with freezing rain that turned Malmö's streets into mirrors. Sara arrived at the Economic Crime Division office fifteen minutes before the Europol meeting, coffee in hand, prepared to formally lose jurisdiction over a case she'd already lost in every way that mattered.

The meeting room was too warm, the air stale with recirculated heat. Karin Ljungström sat across the table with two Europol liaisons whose names Sara immediately forgot—she was getting worse at names lately, or maybe she just didn't care enough to remember people who were taking her case.

The handoff took forty-five minutes. Sara and Emil presented their findings: thirty ghost containers, Chen Wei's confession, the ML model forensics, the dead-end traces. Karin asked clarifying questions. The Europol liaisons made notes. Everyone was professional and efficient and Sara felt like she was attending a funeral where no one quite remembered the deceased.

"Excellent work documenting the methodology," one of the liaisons said. His accent suggested Belgium or Netherlands. "This will help us coordinate with other member states. We've had similar reports from Hamburg and Rotterdam."

Sara sat forward. "Similar how?"

"Anonymous tips about containers cleared through customs but never reaching their destinations. No proof yet, but the pattern suggests coordinated operations across multiple ports."

"So Chen Wei isn't the only one."

"Almost certainly not. We're working with national police in Germany and the Netherlands to identify potential inside facilitators. Your documentation of the extortion method is valuable—helps us know what to look for."

After the meeting, Sara and Emil walked back to their desks in silence. The office was half-empty on Monday morning, colleagues slowly arriving, the coffee pot brewing its first cycle.

"Well," Emil said finally. "That's that."

Sara pulled up the pharmacy case files she'd mentioned to Emil on Friday. "Apotek Hjärtat in Värnhem, Kronans Apotek in Möllevången, and one in Triangeln. Three robberies over two weeks. No violence, no witnesses, just missing medications and dead security cameras."

"What kind of medications?"

"High-value prescriptions. Opioid painkillers, ADHD medications, anxiety drugs. Black market resale value in the tens of thousands."

Emil pulled up the security system specs. "All three use SecureWatch security. Same company. Camera systems, smart locks, integrated AI monitoring."

"That's either a pattern or a coincidence."

"In our line of work, coincidences are just patterns we don't understand yet."

Sara pulled up the incident reports. The first robbery had occurred two weeks ago on a Thursday night. Cameras went offline at 11:47 PM. Came back online at 12:03 AM. Sixteen minutes of darkness. When staff arrived in the morning, medications were gone, no signs of forced entry, no fingerprints, no DNA.

The second robbery, same pattern. Cameras offline 11:52 PM, back at 12:09 PM. Seventeen minutes.

The third, Wednesday last week. Cameras offline 11:49 PM, back at 12:02 AM. Thirteen minutes.

"Overnight timing," Emil noted. "After closing but before cleaning crews arrive. The window when pharmacies are empty but still have inventory."

"And the cameras just happened to malfunction at the exact times needed?"

"SecureWatch cameras don't malfunction. They reboot on schedule for software updates. Security protocol—keeps the firmware current, prevents vulnerabilities."

Sara saw where this was going. "Scheduled reboots. Predictable timing."

"Theoretically. But the schedule is randomized to prevent exactly this kind of exploitation. The AI system picks a time window between midnight and 4 AM, varies it night to night, updates at a different time for each camera cluster."

"So how did the robbers know exactly when to hit?"

Emil was already pulling up technical documentation. "Give me an hour with the SecureWatch API docs and the pharmacy incident logs. If this is what I think it is, it's elegant."

Sara left him to his analysis and went to interview the pharmacy managers. Apotek Hjärtat's manager was a tired woman in her fifties named Britta who'd worked in pharmacy for thirty years and had never seen anything like this.

"No broken windows, no jimmied locks. The security company says the system worked perfectly—it just rebooted at its scheduled time. Bad luck."

"Three times. Three different pharmacies. All bad luck?"

Britta's expression suggested she wasn't stupid. "I said that's what the security company told me. I didn't say I believed them."

"Did you notice anything unusual in the days before? Anyone asking strange questions? Unfamiliar faces?"

"Detective, this is a pharmacy in Värnhem. We have a hundred unfamiliar faces a day. Students, immigrants, tourists, addicts looking for easy scores. I can't catalog everyone who walks through."

Sara tried a different angle. "Your online reviews. Have you noticed any unusual activity? Lots of new reviews suddenly?"

"We get reviews constantly. I don't monitor them closely. Why?"

Sara explained the port case in general terms—how criminals could manipulate systems by feeding them data that looked normal but was designed to trigger specific responses. Britta listened with increasing alarm.

"You think someone wrote fake reviews to hack our security?"

"I think someone understood your security system better than you do and found a way to make it predictable."

By the time Sara returned to the office, Emil had filled a whiteboard with diagrams and API calls.

"SecureWatch uses a randomization algorithm for reboot scheduling," he explained. "The algorithm takes multiple inputs: system load, network traffic, local time, building occupancy sensors, and—this is the clever part—customer satisfaction data."

"Customer satisfaction affects security reboots?"

"The company's reasoning is that scheduled maintenance should happen during low-traffic periods. They pull data from Google reviews, Trustpilot, social media mentions. High negative sentiment suggests more customer traffic, more complaints, more chaos. The algorithm interprets that as 'busy period' and delays maintenance."

"So if you could manipulate the review sentiment..."

"You could influence when the system thinks is a low-traffic period. The randomization isn't random if you control one of the random seeds."

Sara stared at the whiteboard. "That's insane."

"That's machine learning. The model learns to correlate review sentiment with actual traffic patterns. Usually it works. Except when someone feeds it synthetic sentiment data designed to produce specific timing."

"Show me."

Emil pulled up Trustpilot data for all three pharmacies. "Watch the review patterns two weeks before each robbery. Apotek Hjärtat gets fifteen five-star reviews over three days, all mentioning 'quiet evening service' and 'no wait after 11 PM.' Kronans Apotek gets twenty reviews about 'late night convenience' and 'empty store after closing.' All positive, all emphasizing low traffic late evening."

"And the algorithm interprets that as..."

"Safe window for maintenance. It schedules the reboot during the 'quiet' period that the reviews describe. Which happens to be exactly when the criminals want the cameras down."

Sara felt the same cold comprehension she'd experienced at the port. "They trained the security system to create their own attack window."

"Using completely legitimate review data. No hacking, no malware, just understanding how the algorithm makes decisions and feeding it the right inputs."

"Can you prove it?"

"I can show correlation. The review patterns, the reboot timing, the robberies. But proving intentionality? That's harder. The reviews are from real accounts, mostly. Some are probably fake, but fake reviews aren't illegal. Writing positive reviews about pharmacies isn't a crime."

"But robbing pharmacies is."

"Good luck proving the reviews caused the robberies. A defense attorney would argue coincidence. The algorithm interpreted legitimate customer feedback and happened to schedule maintenance at unfortunate times."

Sara thought about Chen Wei describing her situation: every individual action defensible, the aggregate effect criminal. The same pattern here. Each review innocuous, each reboot scheduled properly, the combination precisely timed to enable robbery.

"Who would know how to do this?" she asked.

"Someone with machine learning expertise. Someone who understood the SecureWatch system architecture. Someone who could analyze review platforms and algorithm behavior."

"Could it be the same people as the port?"

"Possible. The methodology is similar—adversarial ML, manipulating training data, exploiting algorithmic decision-making. But it could also be parallel evolution. Once these techniques are documented, they spread. The port bypass toolkit on the dark web markets? This could be the pharmacy version."

Sara pulled up her notes from the port case. "Different targets, different methods, same underlying approach. Understanding systems and making them work against themselves."

"Welcome to algorithmic crime. Once you see it once, you see it everywhere."

They spent the afternoon analyzing patterns. Emil dove into the SecureWatch API and customer satisfaction integration. Sara cross-referenced the pharmacy locations, staff schedules, delivery times, looking for physical patterns.

By evening, she'd noticed something interesting. All three pharmacies were serviced by the same delivery company for their medication shipments. All three had the same cleaning contractor. All three shared a security system provider.

Service workers again. The invisible infrastructure.

"Pull up the cleaning schedules," Sara told Emil.

He accessed the contractor databases—easier than it should be, Sara thought, but she wasn't going to complain about lax security when it helped her investigation. "Cleaning happens after midnight. Schedule varies by day but generally between 12:30 and 2 AM."

"After the robberies."

"Conveniently after. The cameras are back online before cleaners arrive."

"So the cleaners wouldn't witness anything. They'd just arrive to a clean crime scene."

"Or," Emil said slowly, "the cleaners know exactly when the cameras are scheduled to reboot because they have access to the building management systems."

Sara felt pieces clicking together. "Service workers see everything. They have credentials, access, schedules. They know when buildings are empty, when cameras are offline, when systems are vulnerable."

"And they're economically precarious. Low wages, often immigrants, always first to be laid off. Perfect targets for recruitment."

"We need to interview the cleaning staff."

"All of them?"

"Start with the ones who service these three pharmacies."

Emil made notes. "I'll get the employee lists. But Sara, this is expanding fast. If we're right about service workers being systematic targets, this isn't three pharmacy robberies. This is potentially hundreds of crimes across dozens of sites."

"Then we start with these three and prove the pattern."

Sara's phone rang. The captain. She stepped into the hallway to take it.

"How'd the Europol meeting go?"

"Professional. They're taking the case."

"Good. I need you on something else. We've got a break-in at Turning Torso. Luxury apartment, no forced entry, security footage shows nothing. Owner is a software exec making noise to the mayor."

Sara remembered seeing Turning Torso from the port, wondering about ghosts in that machine. "When?"

"Last night. Sunday evening. Owner was at a dinner, came home to valuables missing. Smart locks logged no unauthorized entry. Cameras show nothing unusual."

"Same pattern as the pharmacies."

"What?"

"Never mind. I'll take it."

Back in the office, Emil had pulled up Turning Torso security specifications. "Please tell me this is what I think it is."

"Luxury apartment robbery. No forced entry. Smart building."

"It's happening." Emil's voice mixed excitement and dread. "Multiple attack vectors, multiple crime types, all using algorithmic exploitation. This is the ecosystem emerging."

Sara looked at the cases spread across their investigation board: port smuggling, pharmacy robberies, now luxury apartment burglaries. Different crimes, different criminals, but similar techniques. Understanding systems, exploiting automation, becoming invisible to algorithmic monitoring.

"How do we investigate this?" she asked. "Traditional police work assumes criminals leave evidence—fingerprints, DNA, witnesses, physical traces. These crimes don't leave traces because they convince the systems that nothing happened."

"We investigate the systems. The algorithms, the training data, the decision-making processes. We find where the manipulation happened and reverse-engineer the attack."

"That requires understanding machine learning better than the people who designed the systems."

"Yes."

"We don't have that expertise."

"No."

They sat in silence, the weight of their limitations settling around them.

"I'm not qualified for this," Sara said quietly. "I'm a traditional detective trying to solve algorithmic crimes. It's like investigating quantum physics with a magnifying glass."

"You're qualified to understand human motivation. The algorithms are just tools. Someone is using them. Someone with reasons, pressures, opportunities. That's still human."

"But the evidence is digital, the attack vectors are mathematical, the traces are in code I can't read. How do I follow leads I can't see?"

"You follow the human traces. The service workers, the economic pressures, the access patterns. You use me for the technical work. We're a team."

Sara wanted to believe that. But she kept thinking about her father, made obsolete by automation he didn't understand. Was she being made obsolete by crimes she couldn't comprehend?

"What happens when criminals automate faster than we can adapt?" she asked.

Emil didn't have an answer.

Her phone buzzed with an email from Karin Ljungström: *Europol coordinating investigation across 7 EU ports. Similar patterns confirmed in Hamburg, Rotterdam, Antwerp, Le Havre, Gdansk, Felixstowe. Chinese and Russian organized crime suspected. We're sharing your methodology documentation with all national police forces. Thank you for your work.*

Seven ports. At least seven Chen Weis, probably more. An international operation running parallel attacks across Europe's shipping infrastructure. And Sara had caught one thread of it, documented the methodology, and handed it off to people with more resources and jurisdiction.

She should feel satisfied. The work mattered. Understanding helped.

But all she felt was tired.

"Let's call it a day," Emil said. "We've been staring at screens for eight hours. The pharmacy case will still be here tomorrow."

"And the Turning Torso case."

"And whatever comes in overnight. There's always another crime."

Sara gathered her things. As they walked out, she noticed the patrol division's schedule board. Shift rotations, beat patterns, response zones. All neatly documented, optimized for coverage, predictable in their efficiency.

She thought about Chen Wei saying the maintenance schedules were posted publicly for safety compliance. About the pharmacy robbery algorithm using customer satisfaction data. About her own investigation patterns—she always started with interviews, always documented chronologically, always built cases from physical evidence inward.

Predictable.

What if criminals were learning police patterns the same way they learned port schedules and pharmacy algorithms? What if the reason they stayed ahead wasn't just technical sophistication but behavioral prediction?

"Emil," she said slowly. "Do we have data on our investigation patterns?"

"What do you mean?"

"Case files. Response times. Investigation methodologies. Do we generate data about how we work?"

"Of course. Everything's logged. Response times for resource allocation, case closure rates for performance metrics, methodological notes for training purposes. Why?"

"Because if that data exists, someone could analyze it. Build a model of how police investigations work. Predict our responses."

Emil stopped walking. "Adversarial ML against police procedures."

"Why not? We're just another system. We have patterns, protocols, predictable behaviors. If someone understood our patterns well enough, they could plan crimes that exploit our blind spots."

"That's paranoid."

"Is it? We just spent a week documenting how criminals exploit every other automated system. Why would we be different?"

Emil was quiet for a long moment. "We're not different. Our procedures are standardized for good reasons—fairness, accountability, legal compliance. But standardization means predictability."

"And predictability means vulnerability."

"So what do we do? Stop being systematic? Randomize our investigations?"

"I don't know. But we should be aware that we might be part of the system being gamed."

They reached the parking lot. The freezing rain had stopped, leaving everything coated in ice. Sara's car was locked under a transparent shell, beautiful and treacherous.

"This is why I drink," Emil said, looking at his own ice-covered car.

"The weather?"

"The mounting realization that everything I thought I knew about investigation is obsolete. That criminals understand our systems better than we do. That we're always playing catch-up in a game where the rules change faster than we can learn them."

"We're not obsolete yet."

"Yet. But give it time. Eventually someone will build an AI that investigates better than we do. Then we'll be like your father—skilled workers replaced by more efficient systems."

Sara unlocked her car, waiting for the ice to melt from the door seal. "Until then, we keep working. Tomorrow we interview cleaning staff, analyze the Turning Torso security logs, build the pharmacy case systematically."

"Predictably."

"Competently. There's a difference."

Emil smiled without humor. "Is there? We're very competent at documenting crimes that are already over."

Sara didn't argue. She drove home through icy streets, thinking about patterns and predictions, about her father's predictable obsolescence and her own possibly predictable future. About police procedures designed for accountability becoming attack surfaces for criminals who understood systems better than the people running them.

At home, she poured wine and pulled up the pharmacy case files again. Three robberies. Perfect timing. No evidence except correlation and algorithmic manipulation.

How did you prove someone had committed a crime by understanding too well how not to leave evidence?

Her phone rang. Unknown number. She almost didn't answer, but professional instinct won out.

"Lindqvist."

"Detective, this is Yusuf Hassan." The voice was young, male, carrying a slight accent she couldn't place. "I think we should talk."

Sara sat up straight. "Who?"

"You don't know my name yet. But you're investigating my work. The pharmacy robberies. I'd prefer to explain myself before you waste more time on theories that are mostly wrong."

Her mind raced. Was this real? A prank? A trap? "Where are you calling from?"

"A burner phone I'll dispose of in five minutes. I'm not ready to be arrested yet. But I am interested in dialogue. You seem smarter than most police."

"Then come in. We'll talk officially."

"No. Not yet. But I wanted you to know—I'm not your enemy. I'm just someone who learned to work around broken systems. We're not so different, you and I."

"If you're not my enemy, stop robbing pharmacies."

"I haven't robbed anything. I just showed someone how. There's a difference."

The line went dead.

Sara stared at her phone, adrenaline coursing through her. She called Emil immediately.

"Someone just called claiming responsibility for the pharmacy robberies. Said his name is Yusuf Hassan. He wanted to 'explain himself.'"

"Did you trace it?"

"He said it was a burner. He'll have ditched it already."

"Yusuf Hassan." Emil was already typing. "Running the name now. Could be an alias, could be real. If he's stupid enough to use his real name... Sara, this could be a breakthrough."

"Or a distraction."

"Or both. But if he calls again, keep him talking. Get him to reveal details. Even if he's using burners, we can build a profile."

After hanging up, Sara sat in her dark apartment, wine forgotten, mind spinning. Why would a criminal call a detective to explain himself? Ego? Strategy? Genuine belief in some kind of justification?

*I just showed someone how.*

Not the robber. The teacher. The methodology provider. Like the dark web vendor selling port bypass toolkits. Not committing crimes directly but enabling them, industrializing them, democratizing sophisticated attack vectors.

Crime as a service. And now the service provider wanted to talk.

Sara didn't know if that made their job easier or much, much harder.
