# Chapter 5: The Catalog of Ruins

The community college sat forty minutes outside Boston, a collection of low brick buildings that looked like they'd been designed by someone who thought education was a necessary bureaucracy rather than an aspiration. Patricia Voss's office was on the second floor, at the end of a hallway lined with motivational posters that had been there so long they'd faded to suggestions.

Detective Marcus Reeves knocked on the door marked "P. Voss - History Department."

"Come in."

The office was small, cramped, nothing like the spacious quarters at Harvard. Books were stacked on every surface, papers graded and ungraded fought for space on the desk, and Patricia Voss sat behind it all, a woman in her late thirties with tired eyes and a cardigan that had seen better years.

She looked at Reeves and Ethan Cross, and something flickered across her face. Recognition, maybe. Or resignation.

"You're here about Jonathan Sterling," she said. Not a question.

Reeves settled into the chair opposite her desk—metal and plastic, the kind that came in bulk orders. "Yes, ma'am. I'm Detective Reeves, this is—"

"Crime scene technician. I know. I saw it on the news. Professor Sterling dead. Heart attack. Natural causes." Patricia leaned back in her chair, which squeaked. "Except you're homicide. So someone thinks maybe it wasn't natural."

"We're being thorough," Reeves said, his standard line wearing thin even to his own ears.

Patricia smiled, but there was no warmth in it. "I'm surprised it took this long, honestly. For someone to kill him. I used to fantasize about it. Very specific, detailed fantasies. The kind you'd be obligated to investigate if I described them to a police officer."

Ethan shifted by the door, uncomfortable. But Reeves just met her gaze steadily. "Tell me about January 2018."

"Ah." Patricia pulled open a desk drawer, retrieved a folder that looked well-handled, and set it on the desk between them. "You've seen his journal. The list."

"How did you know about the journal?"

"I didn't. But Jonathan Sterling documented everything. It would be consistent with his pathology to keep records." She opened the folder. Inside were letters, emails, printed pages. A archive of her own destruction. "I was accepted to a postdoctoral position at Yale. Dream job. Research fellowship studying colonial American history with access to their archives. I'd worked six years for it. My dissertation was published. My recommendations were glowing. And then Jonathan Sterling sent a letter."

She pulled out a copy, handed it to Reeves.

He read it. The language was elegant, the praise carefully calibrated. *Miss Voss demonstrates admirable work ethic... however, concerns about theoretical flexibility... tendency toward methodological rigidity... may lack the innovative thinking required for truly groundbreaking research...*

Every sentence was a knife, precisely placed. Not enough to be obvious sabotage, but enough to plant doubt.

"The offer was rescinded," Patricia said. "They didn't say why, of course. Just that they'd reconsidered. I found out later that Sterling had also called the department head personally. Mentioned 'concerns' about my stability. Suggested I'd crumbled under pressure during my dissertation defense." Her voice was flat, clinical. "I never crumbled. I passed with distinction. But Sterling was Jonathan Sterling, and I was nobody. Who were they going to believe?"

"Why did he do it?" Ethan asked quietly.

Patricia looked at him. "Because I challenged him once. In a seminar, three years earlier. He made a claim about primary sources that was factually incorrect. I pointed it out. Politely. With citations." She shrugged. "He didn't like being corrected. Especially not by a woman. Especially not in front of other students."

Reeves closed the folder carefully. "You came to his house. Seven years ago. You spoke to his wife."

"I was crying." Patricia's voice dropped. "I drove to Beacon Hill, rang the doorbell, and stood in his sitting room crying while Victoria Sterling offered me tea and told me how sorry she was. She knew. She knew what kind of man he was. But she didn't stop him."

"Could anyone have stopped him?"

"Dr. Harrington tried." The name hung in the air. "You know about her, I assume. What he did to her."

Reeves leaned forward slightly. "Tell me what you know."

"I only met her once. Two years ago, at an academic conference. I was presenting a paper—community college professors can still publish, even if we're not supposed to be capable of innovative thinking." The bitterness was acid. "Dr. Harrington was there for a cardiology panel. We ended up at the same hotel bar. Someone mentioned Sterling's name, and I... reacted."

"How?"

"I might have said I hoped he died slowly and painfully." Patricia's smile was sharp. "Dr. Harrington bought me a drink. We talked. She told me her story. How Sterling stole her cardiac research, published it first, destroyed her credibility. She nearly lost her medical license. Spent years rebuilding."

"How did she seem? When she told you this?"

Patricia considered. "Calm. Detached. Like she was discussing a case study rather than her own life. But there was something underneath. Not anger, exactly. More like..." She paused, searching for the word. "Certainty. Like she'd made peace with something. Or made a decision."

Reeves wrote that down. Certainty. Peace. The same words Victoria Sterling had used.

"Did she say anything specific about Sterling? Threats? Plans?"

"No. Nothing like that. She asked about my research, said she admired anyone who kept working despite obstacles. She mentioned her mother had died recently—cancer, long illness. Said watching someone die slowly taught you things about suffering." Patricia's eyes met Reeves's. "Then she said that sometimes the kindest thing was to end suffering quickly. Before it could spread to others."

The words settled in the small office like snow.

"That was two years ago?" Reeves asked.

"About that. Maybe a bit less."

Reeves stood, handing her his card. "If you remember anything else, please call."

Patricia took the card, turned it over in her fingers. "Detective? I didn't kill Jonathan Sterling. But I'd like to shake the hand of whoever did. They saved future students from what happened to me. To Dr. Harrington. To dozens of others." She looked up at him. "That's worth something, isn't it? Saving the ones who come after?"

Michael Bradford lived in Somerville, in a three-story walk-up above a Thai restaurant. The hallway smelled like basil and old carpet. When he opened the door, Reeves saw a man in his early forties, wearing a Boston College sweatshirt and holding a beer despite it being barely noon.

"Mr. Bradford? I'm Detective Reeves. We spoke on the phone."

"Yeah. Come in." Bradford stepped back, letting them into an apartment that was surprisingly neat except for the wall of rejection letters. They were framed, dozens of them, arranged like a gallery exhibition. "My wall of shame. Or maybe my wall of proof. I haven't decided."

Ethan stared. "Those are all—"

"Academic job rejections. Research grants denied. Manuscript submissions returned." Bradford took a long drink of his beer. "I used to be a scholar. Published researcher. Then Jonathan Sterling decided I wasn't."

He moved to the wall, touched one frame. "This one's my favorite. Harvard University Press. Rejection of my manuscript on cardiac research innovations. The editor's note says my work seems 'derivative of Professor Sterling's recent publication.' Sterling's recent publication was my work. He stole it. Published it under his name. And then every door I tried to open, he'd already poisoned."

"You confronted him," Reeves said. "At his house."

"I was drunk. Angry. Stupid." Bradford turned back to face them. "I yelled. Called him a thief. Threatened to expose him. You know what he did? He smiled. Actually smiled. Then he said, 'By all means, Mr. Bradford. Take your allegations to the ethics committee. They'll be very interested in your claims. Almost as interested as they were in the emails I forwarded them about your... instability.'"

"What emails?"

"Emails he fabricated. Made it look like I'd been harassing him. Threatening him. Creating a pattern that made me look paranoid and unstable." Bradford's laugh was hollow. "He was brilliant at it. Building your own destruction with your words, your actions, but twisted just enough that you looked like the problem."

Reeves pulled out his notebook. "When was the last time you saw Sterling?"

"Eight months ago. Academic conference in Chicago. I was there on my own dime, trying to network, see if anyone would give me a chance. Sterling was keynote speaker." Bradford's jaw tightened. "He saw me in the audience. Made eye contact. Then during his speech, he made a point about how academia had to guard against plagiarism and false claims of authorship. Everyone in that room knew he was talking about me."

"How did that make you feel?"

"How do you think? I wanted him dead." Bradford said it flatly, without pretense. "I wanted him to suffer the way I'd suffered. To lose everything he'd built. To feel what it's like when someone takes your life's work and turns it into their trophy."

"Where were you four days ago? The night Sterling died?"

"Home. Alone. Probably drunk." Bradford gestured at his apartment. "I'm a part-time data analyst now. Work from home. No alibi, no witnesses. Just me and my wall of shame."

Ethan spoke up. "You mentioned cardiac research. That was your field?"

"Was. I studied cardiac pharmacology. Specifically, delayed-action compounds. How certain medications could be administered once but continue working over days or weeks." He paused. "Ironic, right? Sterling stole that research. Published it. Made a career talking about work I did. And then his heart gives out. Natural causes, they're saying. But hearts don't just give out. They're stopped. By something. Someone."

Reeves watched him carefully. "You think someone killed him?"

"I think Jonathan Sterling destroyed so many people that the universe finally balanced the equation." Bradford finished his beer, set the bottle down with deliberate care. "I hope someone killed him. I hope it was painful. I hope in those last moments, he understood what it felt like to have everything taken away."

"Did you kill him, Mr. Bradford?"

Bradford looked at Reeves for a long moment. "No. But I wish I had. Because whoever did it had the courage I didn't. They had the skill. The knowledge. The stomach for what needed to be done."

As they walked back to the car, Ethan spoke quietly. "His research was the same as Harrington's. Delayed-action compounds."

"I know."

"He's got motive. Means. No alibi."

"I know that too." Reeves opened the car door, paused. "But he didn't do it."

"How do you know?"

"Because Michael Bradford wanted Sterling to suffer. Wanted him exposed, destroyed, humiliated. A quick death that looks like natural causes?" Reeves shook his head. "That's not revenge for someone like Bradford. That's mercy. And he's not looking to be merciful."

"So who is looking to be merciful?"

Reeves thought about Dr. Harrington's calm eyes. Her controlled voice talking about ending suffering quickly. Patricia Voss's comment about Harrington's mother dying slowly from cancer.

Sometimes the kindest thing was to end suffering quickly. Before it could spread to others.

Not revenge. Mercy killing. Stopping a disease before it could infect more victims.

"Someone who sees themselves as a doctor, not a killer," Reeves said quietly. "Someone who thinks they're saving people."

That evening, back at his apartment, Reeves spread everything across his coffee table. Sterling's journal. The loan card for the poison book. Photos from the crime scene. Ethan's notes about the oddly positioned lamp. Interview transcripts from Patricia Voss and Michael Bradford.

And in the center, a photo of Dr. Olivia Harrington from her Mass General staff page. Professional. Composed. A woman who'd spent twenty years rebuilding a career from ruins.

His phone rang. Dr. Chen.

"Marcus. I've got preliminary autopsy results."

"Tell me something useful."

"I can't." Her frustration was clear even through the phone. "Everything points to natural death. Cardiac arrest, no poisons detected, no trauma, no irregularities beyond some minor hypoxic cell damage that's consistent with his existing cardiac condition. If you're looking for murder, I can't prove it."

"But?"

"But something feels off. I can't quantify it. Can't show it on a test. Just... something." She paused. "If someone killed him, Marcus, they knew exactly what they were doing. Medical expertise. Pharmacological knowledge. And access to compounds that either degrade rapidly or don't register on standard toxicology panels."

"How many people have that combination of expertise?"

"In Boston? Maybe two dozen cardiologists and pharmacologists with that level of knowledge. But to actually do it? To have the stomach for it?" Another pause. "That's a much shorter list."

After hanging up, Reeves sat in the quiet of his apartment and thought about mercy. About suffering. About a woman who'd watched her mother die slowly and learned that sometimes the kindest thing was to end it quickly.

Dr. Olivia Harrington had the expertise. The motive. The intelligence. And unlike Michael Bradford, she didn't want Sterling to suffer. She wanted him to stop. Permanently. Efficiently. Quietly.

Like a doctor ending a terminal patient's pain.

The perfect murder wasn't about revenge. It was about prevention.

And the perfect murderer wasn't driven by rage.

They were driven by the cold, clinical certainty that they were doing what was necessary.

Wait—

Reeves grabbed his notebook, flipped back to his notes from the crime scene. Victoria Sterling's comment about her husband being unusually kind lately. Dr. Chen's mention of minor irregularities. The lamp positioned oddly, as if someone had moved it after Sterling died.

Someone who had medical training. Who would instinctively check the body, ensure the poison had worked, maybe adjust the scene to look more natural.

Someone who'd been in that house three days before Sterling died. Who had opportunity. Knowledge. Motive.

All he needed was proof.

And somewhere, in that house or that Harvard office or Dr. Harrington's own workspace, was the evidence that would connect brilliant doctor to perfect murder.

He just had to find it before she realized how close he was to the truth.
