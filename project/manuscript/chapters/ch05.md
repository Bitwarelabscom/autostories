# Chapter 5: The Skeptic

James's office was a monument to organized chaos. Books stacked in precarious towers, papers everywhere, but somehow he could find anything he needed in seconds. Maya had always envied that—her own organization system was rigid, digital, color-coded. James just seemed to hold the entire structure in his head.

He was at his whiteboard when she arrived, marker in hand, drawing what looked like a decision tree.

"You got my email," Maya said.

"I did. Come in. Close the door." He didn't turn around. "I finished my tests. Ran them three different ways to account for confounds. You want to see the results?"

"Yes."

He erased part of the tree, redrew it. "First test: original philosophical arguments versus established thought experiment summaries. Posted from the same account, similar times of day, similar lengths. The pattern held. Original arguments got minimal engagement. Summaries got hundreds of impressions."

Maya felt vindication settle in her chest. "So you confirmed—"

"I confirmed a correlation. But Maya—" He finally turned to face her. "Correlation isn't causation. You know that. We teach that."

"I know, but—"

"Second test." James cut her off. "I wanted to rule out content difficulty. Maybe original ideas are just harder to process, so people don't engage. So I simplified the original arguments. Made them accessible, clear, readable. Some of them I'd argue were better writing than the derivative summaries."

"And?"

"Same result. Original but accessible: suppressed. Derivative but dense: amplified." He set down the marker. "Which does suggest it's not about readability or processing difficulty."

"That's what I've been trying to tell you."

"But here's where I get stuck." James sat on the edge of his desk. "Third test. I posted the same original argument twice. Once framed as building on Kant, using Kantian language, positioning it as an extension of existing frameworks. Once framed as a new approach, novel terminology, different philosophical foundation."

Maya could see where this was going. "The Kantian framing got engagement."

"Three times as much. Same core argument, Maya. Same ideas. But when I disguised the novelty—when I made it look like it fit into established frameworks—the algorithm let it through."

"Which proves my point. The algorithm is suppressing novelty—"

"Or," James interrupted, "the algorithm is reflecting user preferences. People engage more with ideas that connect to frameworks they already understand. That's not suppression. That's just—human nature. The path of least cognitive resistance."

Maya felt frustration rising. "You're saying this is about user behavior, not algorithmic gatekeeping."

"I'm saying we need to be careful about attributing intent. To be fair to the platforms—and I know that's not a popular position—they're optimizing for engagement. If users prefer familiar frameworks, the algorithm learns to surface familiar frameworks. That's not suppression. That's responsive design."

"James—"

"Let me finish." He pulled up a graph on his laptop, turned it toward her. "I also looked at your methodology. Your Originality Index. It's clever, I'll give you that. But it's got some assumptions baked in."

"What assumptions?"

"You're measuring novelty as distance from existing content. Lexical innovation, syntactic deviation, semantic sparseness. But those measures assume that novelty is inherently valuable. What if—and I'm playing devil's advocate here—what if the algorithm has learned that extreme novelty correlates with lower quality?"

"That's not—"

"Hear me out. Lots of cranks and pseudoscientists use novel terminology and frameworks. Lots of bad poetry uses invented words. Maybe the algorithm learned that extreme novelty is often a marker of content that users don't find valuable. Not because it's suppressing innovation, but because it's filtering noise."

Maya stared at him. "You think I'm seeing patterns that aren't there."

"I think you might be seeing the right pattern but drawing the wrong conclusion." James's voice was gentle but firm. "You're a computational linguist. You know how easy it is to find correlations in large datasets. You know how confirmation bias works. You had a hypothesis—Zara's work is being suppressed—and then you found evidence supporting it. But did you seriously look for alternative explanations?"

"I ran hundreds of tests—"

"Testing the same hypothesis. Did you test the alternative? That users genuinely prefer familiar content, and the algorithm is just giving them what they want?"

Maya wanted to argue. Wanted to pull up her data, walk him through the threshold, show him how precise it was. But James was doing what he always did—Socratic questioning, pushing her to defend every assumption, test every alternative.

It was maddening. It was also good methodology.

"How would I test that?" she asked finally.

"Survey users. Show them original versus derivative content without telling them which is which. See which they prefer. If they consistently choose derivative content, that suggests the algorithm is working as intended. Surfacing what users actually want."

"And if they prefer original content?"

"Then you've got a much stronger case that the algorithm is overriding user preferences. That it's suppressing novelty despite users valuing it." James pulled up another graph. "But Maya, there's something else. Something that bothers me more than the methodology."

"What?"

"The conspiracy thinking." He said it gently, but Maya felt the words like a slap. "You're proposing that multiple platforms, independently, all learned to suppress originality. That academic journals did the same. That this is systemic, coordinated—"

"Not coordinated. Convergent. I never said conspiracy—"

"But that's how it sounds. 'The algorithms are all working together to suppress original thought.' Do you hear how that sounds? How close that is to the kind of pattern-seeking that people do when they're looking for villains?"

"I'm not looking for villains. I'm looking at data."

"Data can tell you what happened. It can't always tell you why. And when you jump to 'algorithmic suppression' instead of 'user preference,' you're making an interpretive leap." James removed his glasses, cleaned them. "I'm not saying you're wrong. I'm saying you need to be more rigorous about eliminating alternative explanations before you publish something that could seriously damage your credibility."

Maya felt anger and doubt warring in her chest. "You think I'm being paranoid."

"I think you're being a concerned mother who found something disturbing and might be overinterpreting it. Which is human. Which is understandable. But it's not good science."

"So all my tests, all my metrics, all my data—that's not good science?"

"Your data is good. Your metrics are sound. But your interpretation jumps from 'there's a correlation' to 'there's intentional suppression' without adequately ruling out simpler explanations. Occam's Razor, Maya. What's more likely: that every major platform and journal independently evolved the same censorship mechanism, or that humans prefer familiar content and algorithms learned to surface it?"

Maya stood up. She needed to move, needed to think. "Let me ask you something."

"All right."

"Your third test. The one where you framed the same argument two different ways. Kantian versus novel."

"Yes."

"Did the content change?"

"No. Same core ideas."

"But one got three times the engagement."

"Yes."

"Doesn't that bother you? That the same idea, expressed in different language, gets such different treatment? That whether an idea can spread depends not on its merit but on whether it's camouflaged inside familiar frameworks?"

James was quiet for a moment. "Yes. It bothers me. But that could still be user preference. People might need familiar frameworks as anchors to understand new ideas."

"Or the algorithm might have learned that novel frameworks are unpredictable, and unpredictability is bad for engagement metrics, so it suppresses them regardless of whether users would value them if given the chance."

"That's possible. But you need to prove it. Not just assert it."

Maya returned to her chair. "How? How do I prove algorithmic intent versus user preference?"

"That's the question, isn't it?" James spread his hands. "And until you can answer it, I think you need to be very careful about what claims you make. Because if you publish a paper saying 'algorithms are suppressing originality' and it turns out to be 'algorithms are reflecting user preferences,' you'll look like a conspiracy theorist. And that will damage your ability to do good work on this or anything else."

They sat in tense silence. Maya could see his point. Could feel the pull of his skepticism. He was right that she'd jumped quickly from pattern to interpretation. Right that she needed to rule out alternatives.

But she also remembered sitting with Zara, watching her daughter's original work disappear while derivative posts went viral. Remembered the hurt in Zara's voice: "When I pretend to be other people, everyone can hear me. When I try to be myself, I'm invisible."

Was that just user preference? Just people choosing comfortable, familiar content?

Or was it something more insidious?

"I'll run your test," Maya said finally. "Survey users. Original versus derivative content, blind comparison. See what they prefer."

"Good."

"But James—if they prefer the original content, if the data shows the algorithm is overriding user preferences, will you accept that this is suppression?"

He was quiet for a long moment. "If the data is rigorous. If you've controlled for confounds. If you can rule out alternative explanations. Then yes. I'll accept it."

"Even though it sounds like conspiracy thinking?"

"Even though." James met her eyes. "Because you're right that it matters. If platforms are overriding user preferences to optimize their own metrics, that's a serious problem. But Maya, extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. And right now, your evidence is good but not extraordinary."

Maya nodded. She understood what he was asking for. More rigor. More tests. More certainty before making claims that would sound, to many people, like paranoid pattern-seeking.

But she also felt the clock ticking. How many more people were being filtered out while she ran additional tests? How many original ideas were disappearing while she worked to prove they were disappearing?

"I should go," she said, standing. "I've got a seminar in twenty minutes."

"Maya." James's voice stopped her at the door. "I'm not trying to shut you down. I'm trying to help you build a case strong enough that people will have to take it seriously. Okay?"

"I know." And she did know. James was being a good colleague, a good philosopher, a good skeptic. Pushing her to be more rigorous.

It was just exhausting.

Outside his office, Maya leaned against the wall and pulled out her phone. She had emails from three graduate students, a reminder about a committee meeting, a text from Zara asking if they could order Thai food for dinner.

And, buried in the notifications, a message from an unknown number.

*You're looking for proof. I can help. But we need to meet in person. Coffee shop on 5th and Market, tomorrow at 3 PM. I'll find you.*

*Don't reply to this message. It won't work. Just show up.*

*—E*

Maya stared at the message. Anonymous contact. Cloak-and-dagger meeting. This was exactly the kind of thing James would roll his eyes at. Exactly the kind of thing that fed into the conspiracy-theory narrative.

But it was also exactly the kind of thing a whistleblower would do.

She deleted the message and added the meeting to her calendar under "Coffee—research source."

James wanted extraordinary evidence. Maybe E—whoever they were—could provide it.

Or maybe Maya was falling down a rabbit hole of pattern-seeking and paranoia, seeing suppression everywhere, finding villains in algorithms and informants in anonymous texts.

She wouldn't know until tomorrow at 3 PM.

Maya straightened, shouldered her bag, and headed to her seminar. Where she would teach students about corpus linguistics and computational analysis and the importance of rigorous methodology.

Where she would say all the things James had just said to her, because they were true and important and foundational to good research.

Where she would not mention that she was investigating whether their entire information ecosystem was systematically suppressing original thought.

Because without extraordinary evidence, it just sounded crazy.

Even though Maya was increasingly certain it was true.

She walked across campus in weak November sunlight, thinking about thresholds and user preferences and the difference between conspiracy and convergence. Thinking about her daughter's invisible poetry and her own rejected papers. Thinking about James's skepticism and her own certainty.

Somewhere in the data, there was an answer.

She just had to find it before the algorithms learned to hide that too.
