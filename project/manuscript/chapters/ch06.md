# Chapter 6: Transitions

Tuesday morning brought the first snow of December that actually stuck to the ground. Sara watched it accumulate on the window ledge outside the Economic Crime Division office while Emil ran background searches on Yusuf Hassan. The name had returned forty-seven matches in Malmö alone—too common to be useful without additional identifying information.

"Age range?" Sara asked.

"He sounded young. Mid-twenties to early thirties?"

"Accent?"

"Swedish but with something else underneath. Could be second-generation immigrant. Could be native speaker who learned another language young. Hard to tell from thirty seconds of phone conversation."

Sara's phone rang. Karin Ljungström.

"Quick update," Karin said. "Chen Wei is cooperating with Europol. We're arranging protection and relocation. She's provided detailed information about the smuggling operation's communication protocols."

"Is she being charged?"

"That's still being determined. The prosecutor's office is arguing for charges with suspended sentence in exchange for continued cooperation. But her immigration attorney is pushing for full immunity given the coercion circumstances."

"What about her family in China?"

"That's complicated. We've contacted Swedish embassy in Beijing, but there's only so much we can do. If Chinese organized crime wants to pressure her family, we don't have leverage to stop them."

Sara thought about Chen Wei's careful documentation, her precise Swedish, her meticulous effort to do everything correctly in a situation designed to make correctness impossible. "If she testifies, will it actually help catch anyone?"

"Probably not the people at the top. But it helps us understand the network structure, the recruitment methods, the operational security. That's valuable for preventing the next operation."

After hanging up, Sara stared at her notes on Chen Wei. Another case where understanding mattered but justice didn't quite arrive. The people who'd threatened Chen Wei's family, who'd designed the ML attack, who'd coordinated seven European ports—they'd remain safely distant while Chen Wei negotiated her survival in witness protection.

"Europol's taking care of Chen Wei," Sara told Emil. "Protection and relocation."

"Good. She deserves better than prison."

"She deserves not to have been extorted in the first place."

"Yeah, well. Deserve's got nothing to do with it."

Sara recognized the quote—Unforgiven, Clint Eastwood, the bleakness of Western justice. Emil was in a dark mood. She needed to pull him back before cynicism calcified into resignation.

"Tell me about the pharmacy case," she said. "What do we actually have?"

Emil pulled up his analysis. "Three confirmed robberies using the same SecureWatch exploitation. The Trustpilot review pattern is clear enough to present to a prosecutor. The problem is connecting the reviews to a specific person. The accounts are real, distributed across normal users plus some likely fakes. We can't prove who generated the fake reviews or coordinated the real ones."

"But Yusuf claimed responsibility."

"For teaching the method. Not for doing it. And he called from an untraceable burner. Even if we found him, a defense attorney would argue he was just explaining hypothetical vulnerabilities, not admitting to crimes."

Sara thought about that. "He called me because he wants something. Credit? Respect? To prove he's smarter than us?"

"Or to distract us while he does something else. Could be misdirection."

"Then we investigate both angles. The pharmacy robberies themselves and Yusuf Hassan. See which thread pulls."

They spent Tuesday afternoon interviewing cleaning staff. The contractor company, Nordic Clean Services, employed forty-three people across Malmö. Sara and Emil focused on the six who serviced the three pharmacies.

The first three interviews were unremarkable: immigrants working night shifts, competent but exhausted, no obvious red flags. Standard background checks showed nothing unusual—proper work permits, clean records, unremarkable financial situations.

The fourth interview was more interesting.

Katarina Ek was forty-one, Swedish-born, formerly a high school math teacher before budget cuts eliminated her position three years ago. She'd been with Nordic Clean for two years, worked the late shift to supplement her teaching income when she'd had students, kept the job afterward because she needed health insurance for her daughter.

"You have a math background," Sara noted. "That's unusual for cleaning work."

Katarina's smile was tired. "Unemployment doesn't care about your education. I applied to forty-seven teaching positions. None hired me. Too old, too expensive, too many younger candidates willing to work for less. So I clean pharmacies at midnight."

"Do you like it?"

"Does anyone like cleaning? But it's honest work. I show up, do the job, go home. No taking work home like teaching. No grading papers until 2 AM. Just physical labor and a paycheck."

"You service Apotek Hjärtat, correct?"

"Among others. I have a route—three pharmacies, two medical offices, one dental clinic. Six nights a week."

"Did you notice anything unusual at Apotek Hjärtat over the past month?"

Katarina considered the question with what seemed like genuine thought. "Define unusual. I see a lot at night. People think buildings are empty, so they're careless. I've found drug paraphernalia in bathroom stalls, evidence of affairs in office desk drawers, financial documents left on printers. People forget that cleaners exist."

Sara leaned forward. "What about security systems? Do you interact with those?"

"I have override codes for the smart locks when I arrive. The security company knows my schedule—the system disarms automatically when I clock in. I re-arm when I leave."

"Do you ever notice when the cameras are offline?"

"Sometimes. There are little indicator lights. If they're rebooting or updating, the lights blink differently. Why?"

Emil showed her the timeline. "These are the three pharmacy robberies. Did you work those nights?"

Katarina studied the dates. "No. These are all Wednesdays and Thursdays. I have Wednesdays off. My daughter has therapy appointments."

An alibi, but easily verified. Sara made a note to check the scheduling system.

"Do you know anyone who might have information about pharmacy security? Maybe someone who talked about the systems, seemed overly interested?"

"Detective, I work nights cleaning buildings. My social circle is other people who work nights cleaning buildings. We talk about pay, schedules, how much our backs hurt. Not security systems."

After Katarina left, Emil pulled up her background in detail. "No criminal record. Financial situation is tight but not desperate. Daughter is seventeen, high-functioning autism, expensive therapy. Katarina's rent is reasonable, no major debts except medical bills. She's exactly who she appears to be—an overqualified person doing necessary work she's overqualified for."

"The invisible labor force," Sara said. "Smart, competent, economically precarious. Everything we talked about with Chen Wei."

"But no evidence connecting her to the robberies."

"No. But flag her file. Something about her story resonates. Math teacher turned cleaner. That's a trajectory."

They interviewed the remaining two cleaners—both showed alibis for the robbery nights, both seemed genuinely uninvolved. By evening, Sara's theory about cleaning staff inside knowledge felt less convincing.

"Maybe the service worker angle is a dead end," Emil said. "Maybe the robberies were purely remote—someone exploited SecureWatch from outside, never needed physical access."

"Then how did they know which pharmacies to target? Why these three specifically?"

"Public information. Google Maps shows which pharmacies exist. Business registrations show which security company they use. It's all discoverable without inside knowledge."

Sara wanted to argue, but he was right. Her pattern recognition was finding patterns that might just be noise.

Wednesday afternoon, Sara received a message from an encrypted number: *Coffee? I promise not to disappear immediately this time. - YH*

She showed Emil. "He wants to meet."

"Obviously a trap."

"Obviously. But what if it's not?"

"Then it's incredibly stupid on his part."

"Or incredibly confident."

They debated for twenty minutes. Finally Sara typed back: *Where and when?*

The response came immediately: *Rosengård Centrum food court. Thursday 3 PM. Come alone or I'll know and leave.*

"Rosengård," Emil said. "Public, crowded, lots of exits. Smart choice."

"I'm going."

"I'm coming as backup. He said alone, not unprotected. I'll be at a distance."

"If he spots you—"

"He won't. I'm good at being invisible when I need to be."

Sara filed the meeting location and time with her captain, who was predictably unhappy about an unsupervised meet with a potential suspect. But she argued that Yusuf hadn't actually admitted to committing crimes, just teaching methods, and she was investigating a series of robberies where leads were scarce. The captain agreed reluctantly, with strict protocols: body camera, check-ins every fifteen minutes, backup on standby.

By Wednesday evening, Sara had wrapped up the last administrative threads of the port case. Final reports filed, evidence logged and transferred to Europol, witness statements notarized. Chen Wei was somewhere in protective custody, probably terrified, probably second-guessing her choice to cooperate. The smuggling network was being investigated by people with more resources and jurisdiction. Sara's role was complete.

It should have felt like closure. Instead it felt like abandonment.

She found Emil still at his desk at 7 PM, surrounded by energy drink cans and code printouts.

"Go home," she told him.

"I'm close to something with the SecureWatch algorithm. If I can demonstrate the exact mechanism—"

"Tomorrow. You need sleep."

"Sleep is for people who aren't being outpaced by criminals."

Sara sat on the edge of his desk. "This isn't sustainable. You're drinking too much coffee, sleeping too little, obsessing over cases we can't solve. You're going to burn out."

"I'm already burned out. I'm running on fumes and spite."

"Then take a break. Use vacation time. Get some distance."

Emil looked at her with exhausted eyes. "If I take a break, I'll never come back. The only thing keeping me here is momentum. If I stop moving, I'll see clearly how pointless this all is."

Sara recognized the edge he was on. She'd been there herself after her father's death, when she'd worked eighty-hour weeks to avoid going home to an empty apartment where grief waited.

"You matter," she said quietly. "The work matters. Even when we don't win, understanding helps. We documented the port methodology. That's helping Europol coordinate across seven countries. That's not pointless."

"We helped them understand how the crime was already committed. Past tense. We're archivists, not detectives."

"Then we get ahead of the next one. The pharmacy case. Yusuf reaching out. This could be our chance to catch something in progress instead of documenting ghosts."

Emil was quiet for a long moment. "What if we can't? What if we're structurally too slow, too bureaucratic, too bound by legal constraints? What if the criminals are just better at this than we'll ever be?"

"Then we do our best anyway. Because the alternative is giving up, and people like Chen Wei need someone to give a shit even when the odds are bad."

"Chen Wei's in protective custody awaiting a prosecution decision. We didn't save her. We documented her victimization and handed her off to people who might charge her with crimes she was coerced into."

"We gave her a chance. That's more than she had before."

Emil rubbed his face. "I'm tired, Sara. I'm tired of being too late. I'm tired of algorithmic crimes I barely understand. I'm tired of watching criminals innovate while we fill out forms. I'm just... tired."

"I know. Me too. But we've got a lead. Yusuf wants to talk. Tomorrow at 3 PM. Let's see what he has to say."

"And if it's nothing? If it's just ego or misdirection?"

"Then we keep working the pharmacy case. Interview more people. Analyze more data. Keep trying."

Emil nodded slowly. "Okay. Tomorrow. But Sara? If this doesn't go somewhere, if we're still just documenting crimes that are already over, I think I need to seriously consider whether I can keep doing this."

Sara didn't try to talk him out of it. "Fair enough. Let's see what Thursday brings."

---

That night, Sara couldn't sleep. She kept thinking about trajectories. Chen Wei's trajectory from Shanghai to Malmö, from legitimate hope to coerced complicity to protective custody. Her father's trajectory from skilled worker to obsolete burden to early grave. Emil's trajectory from idealistic recruit to burned-out analyst questioning whether to quit. Katarina Ek's trajectory from math teacher to midnight cleaner.

And her own trajectory. Forty-one years old, divorced, no children, living alone in a deliberately analog apartment while investigating crimes she felt increasingly unqualified to understand. Where was she headed? Toward competence and eventual success? Or toward her father's exhausted resignation?

She thought about Yusuf Hassan, whoever he was. Young, confident, willing to call a detective to explain himself. What was his trajectory? From what starting point to what destination?

*I'm just someone who learned to work around broken systems.*

Weren't they all? Chen Wei working around surveillance and immigration bureaucracy. Katarina working around unemployment and medical bills. Emil working around police resource constraints. Sara working around her own technical limitations.

The difference was legality. Some workarounds were approved, some were crimes. But the underlying motive—survival, agency, refusing to accept the system's verdict on your value—that was universal.

Maybe that's why Yusuf wanted to talk. Not to confess or be caught, but to be understood. To explain that he wasn't a criminal in his own narrative, just someone navigating broken systems with tools nobody had forbidden him from learning.

Sara's phone buzzed. A message from an encrypted number: *Bring questions, not just accusations. This could be interesting for both of us. - YH*

She typed back: *Why did you reach out?*

The response took several minutes: *Because police who understand are better than police who don't. Better investigations, better prosecutions, better systems eventually. I'd rather be caught by someone smart than harassed by someone stupid. See you tomorrow.*

Sara stared at the message. Was it genuine? Manipulative? Some mixture?

Tomorrow she'd find out. Tomorrow she'd sit across from someone who might be a breakthrough or a distraction, a teacher or a criminal, or that strange category Yusuf seemed to inhabit: someone who enabled crimes while maintaining distance from their commission.

Crime as a service. Methodology as a product. Guilt distributed across networks until individual culpability dissolved into systemic exploitation.

She thought about her captain's warning: standardization means predictability. About her own observation: police procedures are just another system to be gamed.

If Yusuf was as smart as he seemed, he'd already modeled police responses. He knew she'd bring backup despite his request to come alone. He knew she'd be wearing a body camera. He knew she'd file location and time with her superiors.

So why meet at all? What was he gaining?

Sara didn't know. But she'd find out tomorrow.

Outside her window, snow continued falling on Malmö, covering the city in white. Turning Torso was barely visible through the darkness, its lights diffused by snow. Somewhere in that tower, a software executive was wondering how his smart locks had failed. Somewhere in Rosengård, Yusuf Hassan was planning tomorrow's conversation. Somewhere in protective custody, Chen Wei was negotiating her future with people who held her freedom in their hands.

And somewhere, criminals Sara hadn't even imagined yet were training new models, exploiting new systems, finding new ways to become invisible through perfect pattern mimicry.

The snow made everything look clean and simple. But under the white, the city ran on algorithms Sara was only beginning to understand, exploited by people who understood them better, protected by police who were always one step behind.

She finally fell asleep around 2 AM, dreaming of ghosts in machines, patterns in noise, and her father's face in the moment he'd learned his crane operator job was being automated.

In the dream, he said: *You can't fight the machines, Sara. You can only document your own obsolescence.*

She woke up at 6 AM with the dream still fresh, made coffee, and started preparing questions for Yusuf Hassan.

If she was going to be obsolete, at least she'd be well-documented.
