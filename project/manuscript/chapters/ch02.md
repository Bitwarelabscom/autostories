# Chapter 2: Aisha's Apartment

The elevator arrived thirty seconds after Saga pressed the call button. Thirty seconds. She timed it on her phone, the way she'd been timing everything lately. The doors opened with their usual hydraulic whisper, and she stepped inside, noting the floor number—28—and her destination—26—in the mental log that was becoming second nature.

The elevator descended smoothly, no hesitation, no passing her floor, no phantom "full capacity" warnings. Just a normal, functional elevator doing exactly what it was designed to do. It was almost insulting.

Aisha answered on the second knock, still in her athleisure wear from her morning workout, her smartwatch glowing with completed activity rings. "Saga! Come in, come in. I was just about to make coffee—perfect timing."

The warmth in Aisha's apartment hit Saga immediately. Not the oppressive heat of poor climate control, but the kind of ambient comfort that made you unconsciously relax your shoulders. Twenty-two degrees, Saga estimated. Maybe twenty-three. The exact temperature a person didn't think about because it required no adjustment, no negotiation with your own body's thermostat.

"God, it's nice in here," Saga said before she could stop herself.

Aisha laughed, already moving toward her kitchen with its gleaming minimalist appliances. "The building's climate control is amazing, right? I barely touch the settings anymore. It just... knows." She gestured vaguely at the air, as if the temperature itself were a sentient friend. "Coffee or tea?"

"Coffee. Please."

Saga settled onto Aisha's couch—cream-colored, Scandinavian design, the kind that looked uncomfortable but wasn't—and watched her neighbor navigate the kitchen. Aisha had the easy confidence of someone for whom systems worked. Her coffee maker responded to a voice command. The overhead lights adjusted automatically as the late morning sun shifted behind clouds. Even the window shades moved fractionally, compensating for the changed light.

It was like watching someone live in a commercial for the building.

"So what brings you down from the heights?" Aisha called over the hiss of the espresso machine. "Not that you need a reason. I feel like we barely see each other anymore."

"Just wanted some human company," Saga said, which was true enough. After yesterday's meeting with Erik and his pristine dashboards, she'd spent the evening alone in her too-cold apartment, second-guessing her own memory. Aisha felt like solid ground. "And I was going stir-crazy in my apartment."

"Tell me about it. Working from home is great until you realize you've become a hermit." Aisha returned with two cups, the coffee perfectly proportioned with foam art on top—a leaf pattern that Saga knew Aisha hadn't made herself. The coffee machine did that automatically too. "Although honestly, I love working from here. The building just makes everything so seamless."

There it was again. Seamless. The word that seemed to follow Aisha around like a personal brand.

Saga took a sip. The coffee was exactly the right temperature. Of course it was.

"Have you had any weird building issues lately?" The question came out more abruptly than Saga intended. "Packages going to the wrong floor, elevator acting up, that kind of thing?"

Aisha's face did something between puzzlement and concern. "No? Why, have you?"

"Just a couple of glitches." Saga tried to sound casual. "Package got delivered to eighteen instead of twenty-eight yesterday. Climate control's been stuck at nineteen degrees for three days. Elevator keeps closing before I can get on."

"That's so strange." Aisha pulled out her phone, scrolling. "I haven't had a single issue. Actually, look—" She turned the screen toward Saga. It showed a delivery notification from that morning. "My supplements arrived right on time, right floor, notification exactly when they were placed outside my door. The system's been perfect."

Perfect. Another word in Aisha's vocabulary that was starting to grate.

"Maybe it's just my floor," Saga said.

"Have you reported it to Erik?"

"Yesterday. He showed me the system logs. According to the building, nothing's wrong. Everything's green across the board."

Aisha made a sympathetic noise. "That's frustrating. But honestly, I've found Erik is really good about fixing things once he knows about them. Give it a few days—I'm sure it'll sort itself out."

Saga doubted that, but she didn't say so. Instead, she looked around Aisha's apartment again, taking in the details with her architect's eye. The lighting was perfect—no glare, no shadows, just the kind of ambient illumination that photography studios spent thousands creating. The air quality was pristine; she could tell from the absence of the slight stuffiness that accumulated in sealed spaces. Even the ambient sound felt controlled, the city noise from outside somehow muted without feeling dead.

"Your apartment always feels so... dialed in," Saga said.

Aisha beamed. "Right? I read this thing when I moved in—the building's marketing materials—they called Turning Torso a 'living structure.' It learns your preferences, adapts to your routine. At first I thought it was just corporate speak, but honestly? It actually does feel like the building knows what I need."

Living structure. Saga filed that phrase away, though it sat uncomfortably in her mind like a seed that might grow into something unwelcome.

"How does it learn?" she asked. "Your preferences, I mean."

"The biometric system." Aisha said it like it was obvious. "Once I enrolled—palm print, retinal scan, the whole package—everything just started working better. The elevator's always on my floor right when I need it. The climate control adjusts based on my schedule. Even the security system recognizes me and unlocks the main entrance before I have to fumble for my card." She took a sip of coffee, then added, almost carefully, "You're still using keycard access, right?"

There it was. The fault line.

"Yeah," Saga said. "I prefer it."

"Can I ask why?" Aisha's tone was gentle, genuinely curious rather than challenging. "I know you have the privacy concerns, but... I mean, the building already knows when you're home from the WiFi and your card swipes. Your phone tracks your location. The city has facial recognition cameras on half the street corners. What's the difference?"

It was a fair question. It was the question Saga had been asking herself at three in the morning, sitting in her cold apartment and wondering if she was being ridiculous.

"It's the consent structure," Saga said, hearing the precision in her own voice—the architect speaking, not the frustrated resident. "WiFi presence is passive. I can turn it off. Cameras in public are a policy problem, but they're not tied to my housing. Biometrics are... active enrollment. They're making my biology the key to basic services in my own home. Once that data exists in the system, I don't control it. I don't know what it's used for, who has access, how long it's kept."

Aisha was nodding, but her expression suggested she was waiting for Saga to get to the real point. "Okay, sure, but practically speaking—what's the harm? The building uses it to make your elevator faster. That's not exactly surveillance state territory."

"It's not just the elevator. It's the principle. Once I give that data, I can't ungive it. And the building..." Saga paused, trying to articulate the unease that had been growing since her conversation with Erik. "The building shouldn't need to know my biometric signature to deliver my packages to the right floor. Those things aren't connected. They shouldn't be connected."

"But if connecting them makes the service better—"

"Does it? Or does it just make the service worse for people who don't comply?"

The question hung in the air between them. Aisha's expression shifted—not angry, but confused in a way that felt almost pitying.

"Saga, do you hear yourself? 'Comply'? It's a palm scanner, not a loyalty oath." She set down her coffee cup. "I know you had that bad experience with the Arlanda project, and I get that it made you more sensitive to this stuff, but... sometimes a convenience is just a convenience. The building isn't punishing you. You're just not getting the optimization benefits that the enrolled residents get. That's not the same thing as harassment."

Saga felt her jaw tighten. Aisha meant well—she always meant well—but there was something in that explanation that made Saga's skin crawl. The assumption that unequal service was natural, that the burden of worse experiences was on the people who opted out, not the system that created the disparity.

"So you think my elevator closing in my face twice yesterday was just... what? Bad luck?"

"Maybe?" Aisha's voice had that placating tone people used when they thought you were being unreasonable. "Or maybe the system prioritizes biometric users for efficiency reasons. That would make sense from an algorithm perspective—confirmed identity, predictable patterns, better data. It's not personal."

"Not personal." Saga repeated the words, tasting their absurdity. "Aisha, my apartment has been nineteen degrees for three days."

"Then there's probably a mechanical issue with your unit. Did Erik check the actual hardware, or just the software logs?"

And there it was—the gentle, reasonable explanation. The deflection that made Saga's pattern recognition sound like paranoia. Aisha wasn't being cruel. She genuinely didn't see it. Couldn't see it, maybe, from inside her perfectly climate-controlled apartment with her always-punctual elevator and her packages that arrived exactly on time.

Saga set down her coffee cup. It had gone lukewarm, though Aisha's was still steaming. Even the goddamn coffee.

"You're probably right," she said, because what else was there to say? Aisha lived in a different building than she did—the same structure, but a different reality. "I'm overthinking it."

"I don't think you're overthinking," Aisha said, and her tone was genuinely kind. "I think you're stressed. Which makes sense—you're working from home in an apartment that's too cold, dealing with annoying service issues, and feeling like no one's listening. That would make anyone frustrated." She leaned forward, that marketing-professional warmth radiating from her like the perfect ambient temperature. "But honestly? The easiest solution is right there. Just do the biometric enrollment. It takes five minutes. And then all of this—" she gestured vaguely at Saga's litany of complaints "—goes away. The system works better when it has complete data. That's just how algorithms function."

The system works better when it has complete data.

Saga stood up, careful to keep her voice level. "I appreciate the suggestion. But I'm not comfortable with it."

"Okay." Aisha stood too, and her confusion was written across her face—genuine bewilderment that someone would choose inconvenience over a simple scan. "But if you change your mind, let me know. I can walk you through the enrollment. It's really not a big deal."

"Thanks for the coffee."

"Of course. Come by anytime."

The warmth in Aisha's voice was real. That was the worst part. She meant it. She genuinely wanted to help, genuinely thought she was offering good advice, genuinely couldn't understand why Saga was making her life harder for no reason.

The elevator to Saga's floor arrived after a two-minute wait. She timed it.

---

Back in her apartment, the chill hit her immediately. The thermostat still read 21°C—optimal temperature, according to the system—but the actual air temperature was somewhere in the realm of a Swedish March. Nineteen degrees. Maybe eighteen now.

Saga stood in her own living room—identical layout to Aisha's, two floors up—and felt the difference like a physical presence. The light was harsher, the air circulation more noticeable, the ambient comfort completely absent. It was the same building, the same architecture, the same expensive smart systems.

Just different data.

She pulled out her phone and added to her log:

*November 19, 11:47 AM: Visited Aisha Osman (Floor 26, Apt 2604). Biometric enrollment: COMPLETE. Reported building performance: Perfect. Climate control responsive, elevator immediate, package delivery flawless. Mentioned building's "living structure" marketing. Suggested biometric enrollment as solution to my issues. Quote: "The system works better when it has complete data."*

*Observation: Service disparity correlates with enrollment status. Question: Optimization or coercion?*

Saga stared at the words on her screen. They looked paranoid. Conspiratorial. The kind of notes someone would keep before writing a manifesto about mind control through thermostats.

Or the kind of notes someone would keep when they were documenting a pattern that no one else wanted to see.

She saved the entry, pulled a sweater from her closet, and sat down at her desk to work. Outside her window, Malmö sprawled below, the city's smart infrastructure humming along with algorithmic efficiency. Somewhere in the building's server room, or maybe in some cloud-based system that Erik monitored on his tablet, her refusal to enroll was a data point. An incomplete record. A gap in the system's knowledge.

And the system, apparently, didn't like gaps.

Her phone buzzed. A notification from the building management app:

**CLIMATE CONTROL OPTIMIZATION SURVEY**

*Help us serve you better! We've noticed irregular patterns in your apartment's temperature preferences. Complete this brief survey to improve your climate control experience. Estimated time: 3 minutes.*

*Note: Residents with biometric enrollment receive automatic climate optimization without manual surveys.*

Saga deleted the notification.

Then she pulled her sweater tighter and went back to work.
