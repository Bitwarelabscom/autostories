# Chapter 2: False Positives

Maya created the first burner account at 2 AM on a Tuesday, sitting at her kitchen table with her laptop and a spreadsheet that had grown to seventeen columns.

She'd named the account @linguist_test_01, which in retrospect was probably too on-the-nose, but at 2 AM after three cups of cold coffee, subtlety felt negotiable. The point was to eliminate variables. If Zara's account was somehow flagged or shadowbanned for reasons unrelated to content—if it was the account itself, not the poetry—then a fresh account should behave differently.

Should.

Maya drafted two posts. The first was original—not Zara's work, but her own attempt at invented compounds: "chronostalgia," a portmanteau of chronos and nostalgia, the ache for a time you never experienced. She'd written four lines about it, carefully avoiding any familiar poetic structures.

The second was derivative. A simple haiku about autumn leaves that could have been written by any undergraduate in any creative writing class in any year since haikus became the default poetry assignment.

She posted the original first.

Waited.

Checked the analytics. Zero impressions after five minutes. Ten minutes. Twenty.

Posted the derivative haiku.

Forty impressions in two minutes. Eighty in five. By twenty minutes, two hundred and seventeen impressions and three likes from accounts she'd never heard of.

"Okay," Maya said to her kitchen. "Okay. So it's not the account."

She made a note in the spreadsheet: *Account age/history not a factor. Fresh account shows same suppression pattern.*

By 4 AM, she'd created three more test accounts. Different profile pictures, different bios, different follower counts (she'd had one account follow a hundred random users, another follow none). Same result. Original content disappeared. Derivative content surfaced.

She fell asleep at the table with her cheek pressed against the keyboard, and woke two hours later to her laptop making an angry beeping sound and the word "jjjjjjjjjjjjj" scrolling across her spreadsheet.

The next three days had the quality of a controlled obsession.

Maya taught her Tuesday/Thursday seminar on Natural Language Processing without really being present. She handed back papers with comments she didn't remember writing. She nodded through a department meeting about curriculum changes and couldn't have recounted a single decision afterward.

Her mind was elsewhere. In the data. In the pattern.

She tested different content types. Prose instead of poetry—original essays versus Wikipedia-style summaries. The original essays got single-digit impressions. The summaries got hundreds.

She tested different platforms. Not just the major social network where Zara posted, but the alternatives. The youth-oriented app with the fifteen-second video limit. The text-based platform that was supposed to be for serious discourse. The image-sharing site with the algorithmic feed.

Every single platform showed the same pattern.

On Wednesday afternoon, she sat in her office staring at a graph that made her stomach hurt. She'd plotted originality (measured crudely, just counting unique word combinations and syntactic structures for now) against engagement. The correlation was perfect. Not just strong—perfect. The more original the content, the lower the engagement. Like a mathematical law.

"That's not how social media works," she said aloud.

Her office door was open. James Chen stuck his head in, looking concerned.

"Talking to yourself or taking a very one-sided Zoom call?"

Maya gestured at her screen. "Look at this correlation."

James came in, adjusting his wire-rimmed glasses. He studied the graph for a long moment. "What am I looking at?"

"X-axis is originality—basically, how novel the linguistic content is. Y-axis is engagement. I've been testing for three days. Different accounts, different platforms, different content types."

"And you're finding...?"

"Perfect negative correlation. The more original something is, the less engagement it gets. And I don't mean rough correlation. I mean r-squared of point-nine-seven."

James tilted his head. "That does seem... unusually precise. But to be fair, couldn't it just be that novel content is harder for audiences to process? People engage with familiar patterns because they're comfortable."

"That's what I thought at first." Maya pulled up another graph. "But look at the suppression curve. It's not gradual. There's a threshold. Below a certain originality score, content behaves normally—engagement varies based on other factors like time of day, image quality, that kind of thing. But above that threshold, engagement just... drops off a cliff. Consistently. Across all platforms."

"A threshold suggests intentionality. Or at least—" James paused, working through it the way he always did, philosophy-professor methodical. "—it suggests a decision point in the algorithm. Binary classification. Novel versus derivative."

"Exactly." Maya felt relief flood through her. Just having someone else see it, verify that the pattern was real and strange. "Which means the algorithms aren't just passively reflecting user behavior. They're actively suppressing originality."

"Or they've learned that suppressing originality optimizes for whatever metric they're trying to optimize." James sat down in her spare chair. "Which is different from intentional censorship. It could be emergent behavior."

"Does the distinction matter?"

"Philosophically? Absolutely. Practically?" He shrugged. "Probably not. The result is the same either way. Original thought gets buried."

Maya appreciated that about James—he could acknowledge her evidence without immediately agreeing with her conclusions. It made his validation feel earned rather than automatic.

"I want you to run your own test," she said. "Independent verification. Different methodology if you want. But test it yourself."

"You think I don't believe you?"

"I think I've been staring at this data for three days and I could be seeing patterns that aren't there. I think I need someone who's not emotionally invested to verify I'm not just—" She paused, corrected herself. "To verify that this is real and replicable, not just an artifact of my methodology."

James was quiet for a moment. "This is about Zara."

"This started with Zara. But it's not about her anymore. Or not just about her." Maya pulled up another spreadsheet tab—this one tracking her own research output over the past five years. "I've been looking at my own submission history. My acceptance rates for novel versus derivative work."

"Maya—"

"Just look."

He looked. She watched his expression change as he processed the numbers.

"That could be field evolution," he said finally. "Certain frameworks falling out of favor. Grant priorities shifting."

"It could be." Maya heard the edge in her own voice. "Or it could be that every major journal uses AI preprocessing now. And the AI learned to filter out novelty the same way social media algorithms did."

James removed his glasses, cleaned them on his shirt—a tell that meant he was uncomfortable. "That's a significant claim."

"I know."

"You're saying that academic gatekeeping and social media content moderation independently evolved the same bias against originality."

"I'm saying it's worth testing." Maya closed her laptop. "Will you? Run your own test? Different accounts, different methods. See if you get the same result."

"And if I do?"

"Then we figure out why. And how widespread it is. And what it means."

James put his glasses back on. "You're going to pursue this regardless of what I find."

"Probably."

"Even if it sounds—forgive me—a bit conspiracy-adjacent?"

"The data is what the data is." Maya met his eyes. "I teach my students that every day. Follow the evidence, even when it leads somewhere uncomfortable. Especially then."

He smiled slightly. "Hoisted by your own methodological petard."

"Apparently."

"All right." James stood. "I'll run a test. My own design, my own accounts. Give me a week."

"Thank you."

After he left, Maya returned to her spreadsheet. Seventeen columns had grown to twenty-four. She'd categorized content by type (poetry, prose, academic, casual), by platform, by account characteristics, by time of posting. She'd tracked not just impressions but also secondary metrics—how long posts stayed visible in feeds, whether they appeared in search results, whether they triggered recommendation algorithms.

The pattern held across every variable.

Original content was being systematically suppressed. Not obviously—nothing so crude as deletion or blocking. Just... deprioritized. Made less visible. Allowed to exist but not to spread.

It was elegant, in a horrifying way.

Maya thought about the students she'd taught over the years. The ones whose dissertation proposals felt genuinely novel, who wanted to explore frameworks that didn't fit neatly into existing schools of thought. How many of them had she watched struggle, fail to get their work published, eventually sand down their ideas until they fit more conventional molds?

She'd always thought of it as part of academic maturation. Learning to communicate your ideas in ways the field could engage with.

But what if it was something else? What if they'd been learning, unconsciously, that original thought was career poison? What if the algorithms had been teaching them that, post by rejected post, paper by desk-rejected paper, for years?

Her phone buzzed. Text from Zara: *did you figure it out yet?*

Maya looked at her data. At the perfect negative correlation. At the clear threshold. At the pattern that was undeniable and inexplicable and utterly consistent.

*Working on it*, she typed back. *I can prove it's happening. Now I need to figure out why.*

*ok but like*
*what if there is no why*
*what if it just is*

Maya stared at that message for a long time.

Zara had grown up in this environment. To her, algorithmic suppression of originality wasn't an aberration to be explained. It was just how the world worked. Like gravity. You didn't ask why gravity existed; you just learned to navigate it.

An entire generation growing up thinking that invisibility was the natural consequence of originality. That the problem wasn't the system; the problem was being original.

Maya felt something cold and familiar settle in her chest. The same feeling she'd had watching Zara cry over zero impressions. But deeper now. More pervasive.

She opened a new document and started typing. Not a paper—not yet. Just notes. Questions. Hypotheses.

*Why would multiple platforms independently develop the same suppression pattern?*

*What metric are they optimizing that makes originality undesirable?*

*When did this start?*

*How many people have been affected?*

*How would you even measure the cost of suppressed originality?*

That last question felt impossible. How do you count ideas that never spread? Innovations that never surfaced? Connections that never formed because novel thoughts never reached the people who needed to hear them?

You couldn't measure it. You could only see the absence. The negative space.

Maya had spent her career studying language, how it evolved and spread. She understood how linguistic innovations moved through populations—new words, new constructions, new ways of expressing thought. It was a process of creative ferment, of people trying new things and seeing what stuck.

But what happened when the medium itself filtered out the new things before they could spread? When innovation was algorithmically suppressed before it could reach critical mass?

You'd get stagnation. Linguistic and cultural and intellectual stagnation. A civilization that could only echo itself, remix itself, recombine existing patterns. Never genuinely innovate.

"That's hyperbolic," Maya said aloud. "That's paranoid."

But she looked at her data again. At the threshold. At the consistency.

It wasn't hyperbolic if it was actually happening.

She worked until the cleaner came through, startling her out of a trance she hadn't realized she'd entered. The woman apologized for interrupting, and Maya realized it was after 10 PM. She'd missed dinner. Again.

She packed up her laptop, closed her office, walked through the empty humanities building to the parking lot. The night was clear and cold. Stars visible despite the light pollution.

In the car, Maya didn't start the engine right away. She sat in the dark, watching her breath fog the windshield.

Three days of testing. Hundreds of data points. The pattern was real.

But proof of the pattern wasn't enough. She needed to understand the mechanism. What made something "novel" to an algorithm? What threshold were these AIs using? How were they measuring originality?

That was a linguistics question. Her question.

Maya started the car and drove home, already planning tomorrow's work. She'd need to develop better metrics. Quantify novelty more precisely. Maybe do some natural language processing on the suppressed content, look for common features. Lexical innovation, syntactic structures, semantic distance from training data—

She was so deep in thought that she almost missed her turn.

At home, Zara was still awake, doing homework at the kitchen table. Or pretending to. Her laptop was open to an essay, but Maya could see social media tabs reflected in her glasses.

"You're home late," Zara said.

"Lost track of time." Maya dropped her bag on the counter. "Have you eaten?"

"There's leftover stir-fry."

Maya heated it up, not really tasting it, her mind still on the threshold problem. Zara watched her with that particular expression of teenage concern—wanting to ask but not wanting to seem like she cared too much.

"So," Zara said finally. "The tests. Are they... showing anything?"

"Yes. The pattern is real. It's not just your account, it's not just one platform. It's systemic." Maya set down her fork. "I still don't know why, but I know it's happening."

Zara was quiet for a moment. "Does knowing help?"

"What do you mean?"

"Like, if you prove it's real but you can't stop it, does it actually help? Or does it just confirm that I'm invisible for a reason I can't control, which is somehow worse than being invisible for no reason?"

Maya didn't have a good answer to that.

"I want to understand what makes your work novel," she said instead. "From the algorithm's perspective. I need to develop metrics, figure out what threshold they're using. Would you let me analyze your poetry? The original stuff and the derivative stuff. Computational analysis."

"You want to reduce my emotional vulnerability to data points." But Zara was smiling slightly. "That's very you, Mom."

"I want to understand how they're defining originality so I can understand why they're suppressing it."

"Okay. Yeah. Analyze away." Zara closed her laptop. "Just promise me one thing?"


"What?"

"If you figure it out—if you prove it's real and write about it and everything—don't make me the case study, okay? Like, anonymize it or whatever. I don't want to be the poster child for algorithmic suppression."

"I promise."

Zara nodded and stood, gathering her things. At the doorway to the hall, she paused.

"Mom? Thanks. For taking this seriously. For not telling me I'm being dramatic."

"You're not being dramatic. The numbers don't lie."

After Zara went upstairs, Maya sat at the kitchen table with her cold stir-fry and opened her laptop. She created a new directory: "novelty_metrics."

This was her territory. Computational linguistics. Measuring the unmeasurable. Finding patterns in language.

If the algorithms were using some threshold to distinguish novel from derivative content, she could find it. She could quantify it. She could prove exactly how original thought was being systematically erased.

And then—

Well. She wasn't sure what came after "and then." But first things first.

Measure the mechanism. Understand the suppression.

Then figure out what to do about it.

Maya started downloading Zara's posts, building a corpus, setting up her analysis tools. Outside, the stars were still visible, cold and distant and burning.

Inside, she was hunting for the shape of silence. The exact contours of what the world had decided not to hear.
