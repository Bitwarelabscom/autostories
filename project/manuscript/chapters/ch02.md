# Chapter 2: The Education of Cruelty

The sitting room felt different in the late afternoon light. Shadows stretched across the Persian rugs like dark water, and Victoria Sterling sat in the same chair she'd occupied that morning, though her composure had settled into something harder, more brittle.

Detective Marcus Reeves watched her hands. They were still, folded in her lap with the precision of someone who'd learned to hold herself together through force of will. The teacup beside her—Royal Worcester, he noted, because Victoria Sterling would never serve tea in anything less—sat untouched, a thin skin forming on the surface.

"Mrs. Sterling, I appreciate you making time for follow-up questions." Reeves pulled out his notebook, the leather cover worn smooth from years of use. "I know this is difficult."

"One does what is required, Detective." Her voice carried that old Boston inflection, the kind that turned vowels into small declarations of superiority. "Though I confess I'm uncertain what more I can tell you. Jonathan died of a heart attack. The medical examiner confirmed it."

"Dr. Chen's preliminary findings, yes." Reeves paused, looking at her. "But sometimes, in cases like these, context matters as much as cause of death. Your husband had enemies. You mentioned that this morning."

Victoria's lips pressed into a thin line. "I believe I said he had adversaries. There's a difference."

"Is there?"

"Enemies suggests passion, Detective. Jonathan inspired something colder." She reached for the teacup, seemed to remember it had gone cold, and withdrew her hand. "Resentment. Bitterness. The kind that festers for years."

Ethan Cross, standing by the doorway with his camera bag, glanced at Reeves. The detective caught the look—Ethan's instincts kicking in, the way they always did when someone said something that felt important.

Reeves leaned forward slightly, his voice gentler. "Tell me about that. The resentment."

For a long moment, Victoria Sterling said nothing. Her gaze drifted to the window, where Beacon Hill's gas lamps were beginning to glow in the gathering dusk. When she spoke, her voice was quieter.

"My husband was a brilliant man, Detective. Genuinely brilliant. A Harvard professor for thirty-two years, published extensively, mentored dozens of doctoral candidates." She paused. "He was also cruel in ways that brilliance seemed to excuse."

"Cruel how?"

"Methodically." The word came out sharp, precise. "Jonathan didn't raise his voice. He didn't throw things or make scenes. He simply... identified weakness and exploited it. Particularly in his students."

Reeves wrote that down, his pen scratching across the page. "Can you give me an example?"

Victoria stood, moving to the bookshelf that dominated the far wall. Family photos lined the middle shelf—formal portraits, mostly, the kind taken at university functions. She touched one frame, her finger lingering on the glass.

"There was a young woman. Patricia, I think her name was. Patricia Voss. She came to the house once, perhaps seven years ago." Victoria's voice remained steady, but something flickered in her eyes. "She was crying. Quietly, the way people cry when they're trying very hard not to. She told me she'd been accepted to a postdoctoral program at Yale—her dream position. But Jonathan had written a letter to the department head."

"What kind of letter?"

"A recommendation, ostensibly. Praising her work ethic but questioning her theoretical rigor. Suggesting she lacked the intellectual flexibility for truly innovative research." Victoria turned back to face him. "The offer was rescinded. She ended up teaching at a community college in Ohio."

Ethan shifted by the door. "That's—wait, that's legal? To sabotage someone like that?"

"Legal, yes. Ethical?" Victoria's smile was bitter. "Jonathan always operated within the boundaries of what was permissible. That was his particular genius."

Reeves stood, crossing to the bookshelf. The photos showed Jonathan Sterling at various university events—awards ceremonies, lecture halls, formal dinners. In each one, he stood slightly apart from others, his expression pleasant but distant. Like a man observing rather than participating.

"Was Patricia Voss the only one?" Reeves asked.

"No." The word hung in the air. "There were others. They would call sometimes, late at night. Or send letters. A few came to the house. I remember a young man—Michael Bradford, I believe—who showed up drunk one evening, shouting about how Jonathan had stolen his research. Published it under his own name."

"Did he?"

Victoria's silence was answer enough.

Reeves turned from the photos. "Mrs. Sterling, why didn't you mention this before? These people had motives. Strong ones."

"Because my husband died of a heart attack, Detective." Her voice sharpened. "You saw the medical examiner. You heard what she said. Natural causes. Whatever cruelties Jonathan inflicted, they were intellectual, not physical. Words and letters and carefully crafted recommendations. None of those students could have—" She stopped, her composure cracking slightly. "None of them could have given him a heart attack."

But Reeves heard what she didn't say: *could they?*

He moved back to his chair, settling into it with the deliberate casualness he used when he wanted someone to keep talking. "Tell me about his record-keeping."

Victoria blinked. "I'm sorry?"

"You said he was methodical. Precise. A man like that would keep records. Documentation."

"He kept everything." Victoria sat back down, some of her rigid posture easing. "Files upon files. Student evaluations, correspondence, research notes. He had a filing system that would put the Library of Congress to shame."

"Did he keep records of these students? The ones whose careers he... damaged?"

Something flickered across Victoria's face—recognition, perhaps, or memory. "He called them his 'educational failures.' Not failures he'd made, but failures he'd identified. Students who didn't meet his standards." She paused. "He kept a list."

Ethan straightened. "A list of names?"

"Names, dates, what he called their 'fundamental deficiencies.' He updated it regularly. Sometimes he would read entries aloud at dinner, as if they were amusing anecdotes." Her voice dropped. "I stopped joining him for dinner about ten years ago."

Reeves felt that familiar tightening in his chest, the sensation he got when a case started to reveal its architecture. "Where would this list be?"

"His office at Harvard, most likely. He spent more time there than here." Victoria looked around the sitting room, as if seeing it clearly for the first time. "This house was just where he slept."

Reeves closed his notebook. "I'll need access to that office."

"I can call the department head in the morning. Make arrangements." Victoria stood, moving to a small desk by the window. She pulled out a card, wrote something on the back. "That's the direct number for the History Department. Ask for Professor Wendell. He'll... cooperate."

As Reeves took the card, Ethan spoke up from the doorway. "Mrs. Sterling, can I ask you somethin'?"

Victoria turned, surprised. She'd barely acknowledged the crime scene tech's presence.

"These photos." Ethan gestured to the bookshelf. "You got pictures of your husband at all these fancy events. Awards, lectures, all that. But there's a gap." He pointed to a space between two frames on the middle shelf. "Somethin' used to be there. You can see the outline in the dust."

Victoria's hand went to her throat, a small, unconscious gesture. "That was—" She stopped, started again. "That was a photograph from Jonathan's tenure ceremony. Twenty years ago. I removed it last month."

"Why?" The question came from Reeves, quiet but insistent.

"Because Dr. Harrington was in it." Victoria's voice was barely above a whisper. "She was his student then. One of his most promising, he said. Before..."

"Before what?"

Victoria Sterling looked at both of them, her aristocratic composure finally crumbling at the edges. "Before he destroyed her too."

The sitting room fell silent except for the ticking of the grandfather clock in the corner. Reeves felt pieces clicking into place, patterns emerging from chaos. Dr. Olivia Harrington—the cardiologist who'd visited three days before Sterling's death. The former student who'd returned a book.

"Tell me about Dr. Harrington," Reeves said.

Victoria moved back to her chair, sinking into it like she was suddenly exhausted. "She was exceptional. Brilliant, dedicated, everything Jonathan claimed to value in a scholar. She was working on groundbreaking research about cardiac pharmacology—how certain compounds could affect heart rhythm in ways that were previously thought impossible."

"What happened?"

"Jonathan happened." Victoria's voice was flat. "He published her work first. Used his connections, his reputation. By the time Olivia tried to publish her own research, it looked like she was plagiarizing him. She nearly lost her medical license."

Ethan whistled low. "How'd she recover?"

"Stubbornness. Talent. She rebuilt her career from nothing, became one of the leading cardiologists in the country despite him." Victoria looked at Reeves. "That's why I noticed when she came to return the book. We hadn't spoken in years. She'd avoided me, avoided anything connected to Jonathan. For her to come here..." She trailed off.

"What did she seem like? When she visited?"

Victoria considered this. "Calm. Almost eerily so. She was kind to me, asked about my health. Mentioned the book—some historical text Jonathan had loaned her months ago—and left it on his desk. She was only here for ten minutes." Her eyes met Reeves's. "She didn't seem angry. That's what struck me. After everything he'd done to her, she should have been angry. But she seemed... at peace."

Reeves wrote that down, underlining it twice. Peace. Three days before Sterling died, a woman whose career he'd nearly destroyed showed up at his house, calm and at peace.

"I'll need to speak with Dr. Harrington," he said, standing. "And I'd like that access to your husband's office arranged as soon as possible."

"Of course." Victoria stood as well, automatically assuming the role of gracious hostess even as her world was being picked apart. "Detective, may I ask you something?"

"Yes, ma'am."

"Do you really think someone killed him? Despite what the medical examiner said?"

Reeves looked at her—this woman who'd spent forty-two years married to a man she'd clearly stopped loving long ago, who kept his cruelties catalogued in her memory like specimens in a case.

"I think your husband made enemies who were smart enough to hide in plain sight," he said. "And I think someone who could destroy careers with letters and recommendations might inspire someone equally methodical to respond in kind."

Victoria Sterling nodded slowly. "That's what I'm afraid of too," she said. "Because if someone did kill Jonathan, if someone managed to make it look like natural causes, then they were brilliant enough to learn from him. And he only taught the best."

As Reeves and Ethan walked back to the car, the crime scene tech spoke quietly. "That list he kept. Of the students he destroyed. You think it's a suspect list now?"

"I think it's a starting point." Reeves looked back at the brownstone, its windows glowing warm in the winter evening. Inside, Victoria Sterling stood framed in the sitting room window, a woman who'd lived with methodical cruelty for four decades.

"Wait—" Reeves stopped, hand on the car door. "What did she say about Dr. Harrington's research? The work Sterling stole?"

Ethan flipped through his notes. "Cardiac pharmacology. Compounds that affect heart rhythm in ways people thought were impossible."

They looked at each other.

"Compounds that could cause cardiac arrest," Reeves said slowly.

"Without leavin' a trace." Ethan finished.

The winter wind cut down Beacon Street, carrying the scent of snow and old money and secrets that had waited years to surface. Reeves got into the car, his mind already moving ahead to tomorrow's visit to Harvard, to the list of failures, to all the people who had reasons to want Jonathan Sterling dead.

But his thoughts kept circling back to Dr. Olivia Harrington, who'd come to the house three days before Sterling died, calm and at peace after decades of anger.

In detective work, peace was often the most damning evidence of all.
