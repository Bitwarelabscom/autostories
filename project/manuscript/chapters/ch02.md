# Chapter 2: Interviews in the Cold

The Limhamn Harbor operations center smelled of coffee and electrical ozone. Sara stood by the window, watching the automated cranes move containers with mechanical precision while Emil set up his laptop at the conference table. Beyond the glass, dock workers in high-visibility vests moved between stacks of cargo—human islands in a sea of automation.

"They're bringing the first one up now," said Margareta Svensson, the port's operations manager. She was in her late fifties, with the weary competence of someone who'd watched her job become increasingly supervisory and decreasingly hands-on.

Sara turned from the window. "How many people have direct access to the container management system?"

"In theory? Seven. In practice?" Margareta pulled up a scheduling interface on the wall screen. "Depends on the shift. We run three rotations. Each has a logistics coordinator who interfaces with the AI systems. But dozens of people have credential access for manual overrides."

"Manual overrides," Emil said without looking up from his screen. "That's how they did it, isn't it?"

"Partly." Margareta's jaw tightened. "The system is designed to be overridden. Sometimes weather delays things, sometimes customs flags a container, sometimes equipment fails. Pure automation sounds good in boardroom presentations, but reality is messier."

Sara recognized the defensive tone. She'd heard it before from people whose professional competence was being questioned by circumstances beyond their control. "We're not here to audit your procedures. We're trying to understand how the system was exploited."

"The irony," Emil said, finally looking up, "is that your manual override protocols are exactly what make the system resilient. The criminals just used that resilience against you. They didn't hack the AI—they convinced it they were legitimate edge cases."

The first port worker arrived: Jonas Persson, second-shift logistics coordinator. Mid-forties, tired eyes, the careful posture of someone who spent twelve-hour shifts at computer terminals. Sara let him settle into a chair across the table before beginning.

"You've worked here how long?"

"Fourteen years. Started on the physical side, moved to coordination when they automated the cranes."

Another one, Sara thought. Another worker who'd adapted or been replaced. "Walk me through a normal shift. What you actually do versus what the system does."

Jonas described a job that was part air traffic controller, part babysitter. The AI handled routing, stacking, crane scheduling, customs integration. His role was to watch for exceptions, respond to alerts, authorize anomalies. "Most nights, I approve maybe twenty manual adjustments. Container dimensions off by a few centimeters, weight distribution flags, delayed customs clearances."

"And you keep logs of those approvals?"

"The system does. Everything's logged."

Emil's fingers moved across his keyboard. "I'm looking at the logs now. November sixteenth through twenty-third. You authorized forty-seven manual adjustments."

Jonas frowned. "That's high, but November's always busy. Pre-Christmas cargo push."

"Forty-seven," Emil repeated. "Of which... thirty-three were legitimate. Fourteen were part of the smuggling operation."

The color drained from Jonas's face. "I would have noticed—"

"You wouldn't have," Sara said gently. "That's the point. They made their containers look exactly like your normal exceptions. You were doing your job correctly. They just understood your job better than you did."

She left him with that cold comfort and moved on to the next interview.

By the third interview, Sara was developing a headache from the fluorescent lights and technical jargon. The pattern was consistent: competent workers making reasonable decisions, each individual judgment defensible, the aggregate effect a massive security breach. The criminals had understood the system as a system—not individual components but an integrated whole with predictable human behaviors at the decision points.

"Next one's here," Margareta said. "Chen Wei. Day shift coordinator."

Sara glanced at her notes. Chen Wei: thirty-five, logistics degree from Shanghai with Swedish certification, five years at Limhamn, clean record, fluent in Mandarin, English, and Swedish. On paper, exactly the kind of skilled immigrant worker Sweden's economy depended on.

The woman who entered was small-framed, dressed in the same high-visibility vest as the others but somehow making it look more formal. Her posture was precise, her expression carefully neutral. She set a folder on the table—her own logs, Sara noted, brought unprompted—and sat with her hands folded.

"Thank you for meeting with us," Sara began in Swedish. "I know this is disruptive to your work."

"It is necessary." Chen Wei's Swedish was grammatically perfect but slightly stilted, each word enunciated with care. "The containers should not have been missed by the system. I am concerned about the security protocols."

Professional concern or fear? Sara couldn't tell yet. "You work the day shift. Six AM to six PM?"

"Correct. Monday through Friday, with rotating weekend coverage."

"And during your shifts, you authorized..." Sara checked her notes. "Thirty-one manual overrides during the relevant period."

"That sounds correct. I can review the specific instances if you need details." Chen Wei opened her folder, revealing printed logs cross-referenced with handwritten notes.

Emil looked up, interested. "You keep paper records?"

"The system keeps records. I keep verification. It is..." she paused, searching for the word. "Belt and suspenders, yes? In China, I learned to document everything. Old habit."

Sara watched Chen Wei's hands. They were steady on the papers, but there was tension in the shoulders, a tightness around the eyes. Nervous, but then everyone they'd interviewed was nervous. Having police ask about your work decisions would make anyone uncomfortable.

"Walk me through your process. When you get an exception alert, what do you do?"

Chen Wei described a methodical approach: verify the alert details, cross-reference with shipping manifests, check physical location via camera if possible, review the AI's reasoning for the flag, make a decision. "The AI is usually correct. But it cannot handle every variable. Sometimes the uncertainty is too high, and it asks for human judgment."

"And these containers?" Sara slid across a list of the fourteen ghost containers that had appeared during Chen Wei's shifts.

Chen Wei studied the list, her expression unchanged. "I remember several of these. November nineteenth, container MSCU-4477392, flagged for weight distribution. The manifest listed industrial machinery parts. The weight was within variance but the distribution was asymmetric. I authorized it because large machinery components are often irregularly shaped."

"That was a correct decision," Emil said. "The container actually did have irregular weight distribution—because of the phone broadcasting fake sensor data. You made the exact decision you should have made with the information you had."

Something flickered across Chen Wei's face. Relief? Or was Sara reading too much into it?

They went through four more containers. Each time, Chen Wei's reasoning was sound, her documentation thorough. She was either an exemplary worker caught in a sophisticated scheme, or she was very, very good at appearing that way.

"Did you notice anything unusual during that period?" Sara asked. "Anything that seemed off, even if you couldn't articulate why?"

Chen Wei was quiet for a long moment. Sara waited.

"There was... perhaps a pattern. Not obvious. But looking back now, several of the exceptions came during shift transitions. When I was beginning my shift and the system was synchronizing overnight changes. Busy times when many alerts come at once."

"Shift transitions," Emil said thoughtfully. "When you'd be most likely to batch-process approvals."

"Yes. I do not like to keep the queue waiting. It creates bottlenecks."

Sara made a note. Targeting shift transitions showed sophisticated operational knowledge. "Did anyone ask you about your shift schedule? Your approval processes?"

"No one unusual. But these are not secrets. The schedules are posted. Everyone who works here knows the rhythms."

After forty minutes, Sara let her go. Chen Wei gathered her papers with the same precise movements she'd brought them in with, gave a small nod, and left.

"Well?" Emil said when the door closed.

"Can't tell. She's either traumatized by the security breach or involved. Could go either way."

"Her documentation is impressive. The paper logs, the cross-referencing. That's someone who's either very careful or very worried about being blamed."

"Or both," Sara said. "Flag her for follow-up. Not as a suspect, just... keep her in mind."

By evening, Sara had interviewed nine port workers and her brain was saturated with logistics terminology. Emil had retreated to his laptop, occasionally muttering technical observations. Margareta had provided them with a small office for the duration—technically a storage room with a desk and a coffee machine that dispensed liquid that approximated coffee.

"Tell me about the phones," Sara said, refilling her cup with the approximated coffee. "You said you'd dig into the models."

Emil swiveled his chair around. He looked energized in a way he hadn't during the interviews. Give him technology to analyze and he came alive; make him watch humans make understandable mistakes and he got depressed.

"The phones are brilliant," he said. "Elegant, even. They're running custom firmware on cheap Android hardware. The base model is trained to simulate standard IoT signatures—temperature sensors, humidity sensors, accelerometers. The kind of environmental monitoring that smart containers use."

"But fake."

"Fake, but statistically indistinguishable from real. The model was trained on thousands of hours of real sensor data. It learned the patterns—temperature fluctuations, vibration signatures, humidity curves. Then it generates new data that fits those patterns."

Sara tried to wrap her head around it. "So the container thinks it has real sensors because the phone is pretending to be sensors?"

"Exactly. But here's the sophisticated part: the model also learned what exceptions look like. Real sensors sometimes glitch. Sometimes they drift out of calibration. Sometimes they report values that are technically possible but unusual. The phone simulates that too."

"It learned to be imperfect."

"It learned that perfect data looks suspicious. So it added realistic noise and occasional anomalies. The AI managing the port sees exactly what it expects to see: mostly normal data with the kind of edge cases that happen in real physical systems."

Sara sat down across from him. "How do you even defend against that?"

"You don't." Emil's voice carried the flat certainty of expertise. "Not reliably. You can add verification layers, cross-reference multiple sensor types, require manual inspection of anomalies. But every verification step slows down operations and costs money. The economic pressure is always toward trusting the automated systems."

"So we're structurally vulnerable."

"Every automated system is. The more sophisticated the AI, the more attack surface for adversarial manipulation. It's an arms race, and the attackers have advantages: they can experiment freely, they can fail and iterate, they only need to win once. Defenders have to win every time."

Sara thought about her father. He'd lost his job when the port installed automated cranes. The promise had been efficiency, safety, cost savings. No one had mentioned that the same automation would create new vulnerabilities. Progress in one dimension, regression in another.

"Can you trace where the models came from? Who trained them?"

"Working on it. The model architecture is standard—TensorFlow, openly available frameworks. The training data would have required access to real sensor logs, probably scraped from legitimate IoT systems or purchased from data brokers. Legal in most jurisdictions. It's the application that's criminal, not the model itself."

"So we're looking for someone with machine learning expertise and access to training data."

"Someone, or a group. This level of sophistication suggests either a professional with deep knowledge or a team pooling skills. The phones themselves were assembled somewhere—probably bulk orders of components, nothing traceable. The firmware was custom but built on open-source tools. Every component is legal and accessible. It's only the combination that's criminal."

Sara stared at her terrible coffee. "We're chasing ghosts."

"We're chasing people who understand how to become ghosts. Different problem."

Through the window, Sara could see the evening shift arriving, workers scanning badges, the automated cranes continuing their mechanical ballet. Somewhere in that flow of people and cargo were answers. Or maybe the answers were already long gone, loaded into trucks during the brief window when the ghost containers were real.

Her phone buzzed. A text from her captain: *How's the port case? Need preliminary report.*

She typed back: *Complex. Need more time.*

The reply came immediately: *You've got until Friday. Then it's Customs' problem.*

Sara showed Emil the message.

"Four days," he said. "I can have preliminary forensics done by then. But don't expect miracles. These people knew what they were doing."

"Maybe someone here knew what they were doing too," Sara said, thinking of Chen Wei's careful documentation, her perfect answers. Or maybe she was seeing patterns where there were only coincidences. That was the problem with invisible crimes—everything looked suspicious when you were looking for something you couldn't see.

"Run deep backgrounds on all the coordinators," she told Emil. "Financial records, communication patterns, anything that stands out."

"You're thinking inside job?"

"I'm thinking someone had operational knowledge. Maybe they were complicit. Maybe they just talked too much in a bar. But the timing, the shift transitions, the specific containers targeted—that's not random. That's informed."

Emil nodded and turned back to his laptop. Sara watched him work for a moment, his face lit by screen glow in the darkening office. Outside, the cranes kept moving, the cameras kept recording, the AI kept optimizing. A perfect system, running perfectly, perfectly exploited.

Her father had died three years ago. Heart attack at sixty-two. The doctors said it was genetic, lifestyle factors, unavoidable. But Sara knew better. She'd watched him deteriorate after the port let him go. Watched his sense of purpose erode. He'd been a skilled crane operator, good at his job, proud of his work. Then one day the machines were better, faster, cheaper. Obsolete.

Now she was investigating crimes committed by people who'd learned to make the machines obsolete right back. There was a symmetry to it that felt less like poetry and more like escalation.

"I'm heading out," she told Emil. "Tomorrow we start over. Interview the night shift, talk to customs, see if any cargo was reported missing in the last six months."

"You know they're long gone, right? The smugglers. Whatever they brought in, it's sold, distributed, consumed. We're investigating a crime that's already over."

"Then we learn from it," Sara said. "So the next one doesn't work."

Emil's skeptical expression suggested he didn't believe that, but he didn't argue. Sara gathered her things and walked out into the December cold, past the workers who'd adapted or been replaced, past the machines that had replaced them, into a city where algorithms decided what was visible and what was ghost.

She thought about Chen Wei's nervous precision, Jonas's defensive competence, all the workers doing exactly what they were supposed to do while crime flowed through the gaps in their understanding. Maybe that was the real lesson. You could do everything right and still be complicit in something wrong.

The Turning Torso was visible in the distance, lit against the dark sky. Sara wondered, briefly, what ghosts lived in that machine. What invisible things moved through its smart systems, unseen by the algorithms meant to protect them.

Tomorrow she'd keep looking. Tonight she'd go home to her small apartment with its deliberately simple locks and wonder if understanding the system was enough, or if she was just documenting her own obsolescence, one careful interview at a time.
