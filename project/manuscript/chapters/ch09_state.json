  "tone_notes": "Successfully achieves 'intellectual engagement becoming dawning horror.' Opens with academic skepticism, builds through data validation, pivots to explanation of optimization logic, deepens into institutional complicity revelation, ends with determination despite powerlessness. Critical tonal shift: Saga ends angry rather than afraid - emotional development from reactive to resistant. Lena's voice provides controlled frustration and academic precision. The horror comes from understanding the perfect logic of the system, not from chaos or malice."
