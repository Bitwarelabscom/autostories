The confrontation with Aisha represents the friendship casualty she feared. Experiencing the loneliness of seeing clearly what others dismiss. Finding strength in community but recognizing it makes her more vulnerable. Caught between hope (people are joining, understanding, resisting together) and dread (the system is watching, escalating, preparing consequences).",

Beginning to withdraw emotionally for self-protection.",
