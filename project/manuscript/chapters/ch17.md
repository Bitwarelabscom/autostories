# Chapter 17: Adversarial

Chen Wei's hands shook so badly she couldn't hold the coffee cup. Sara pushed it aside and placed a box of tissues on the interview table instead.

"Start with how they recruited you," Sara said quietly. "Just that part first."

The interrogation room at Malmö Police headquarters was smaller than the ones used for violent criminals. Softer chairs. No mirror—just a camera in the corner that Chen kept glancing at like it might reach out and grab her.

"They knew," Chen whispered. "About my brother. In Shanghai. His debts." She switched to Mandarin for a moment, something bitter, then back to Swedish. "They showed me pictures. Him outside his apartment. His daughter at school. They said they only needed information."

"What information?"

"Container schedules. Which ones customs would inspect. When the autonomous cranes were doing maintenance cycles." Chen's voice steadied as she moved into technical territory. "The port AI learns patterns from manual overrides. If you know when humans intervene, you know when the AI is vulnerable."

Emil sat against the wall, laptop open, recording everything. He'd been awake for thirty-six hours straight and looked it. "The phones we found. The adversarial ML models. Did you create those?"

"No. They came from someone else. I just had to place them." Chen's eyes welled up. "I thought it was electronics. Maybe counterfeit goods. I didn't know until..."

"Until what?"

"Until I saw the manifests. What really came through." She closed her eyes. "People."

Sara's jaw tightened. "How many containers?"

"Twelve. Over eight months. The empty ones you found were decoys. The real ones were offloaded at night, before the port AI generated morning reports." Chen's words came faster now, like poison she needed to purge. "The network has contacts in six ports—Hamburg, Rotterdam, Gdańsk, Copenhagen, here. They move people and contraband through legitimate supply chains. Everything looks normal to the algorithms because we train them to ignore the right signatures."

Emil was already typing, pulling up shipping manifests and cross-referencing with Europol databases. Sara watched Chen Wei break, her compartmentalized life finally collapsing under its own weight.

"I can give you names," Chen said. "Shipping companies. Contact protocols. The ML model architecture. Everything. But I need—"

"Witness protection." Sara nodded. "I'll recommend it. But Chen, I need all of it. Everyone involved at the port."

"There's only me. That's their system. One person per node, minimal contact, all communication through encrypted channels. I never met anyone face to face except the person who taught me how to place the phones."

"Describe them."

"I can't. It was dark, at the container yard. They wore a mask and spoke through a voice modulator. But they knew the port systems perfectly. They said they'd done this before at other facilities."

Sara exchanged a glance with Emil. The same sophisticated operator across different crime types. They were getting closer.

Emil's phone buzzed. He read the message, then looked up. "Customs is ready at the port. Katarina Ek is in custody—they picked her up an hour ago. And..." He hesitated. "We have an address for Yusuf Hassan. Apartment in Rosengård. The coordinated operation is greenlit for 14:00."

Sara checked her watch: 13:15. Forty-five minutes.

"Get Chen to a safe house," she told Emil. "I'll meet you at the staging point."

---

The port raid went like clockwork.

Three customs vehicles and two police units converged on the Limhamn operations center at 14:00 exactly. They seized computers, phones, and three years of shipping logs. Port administrators cooperated fully—they wanted to know how their AI systems had been compromised. Sara watched from her car as officers carried out boxes of hard drives, thinking about how her father would have felt seeing the machines he'd been replaced by turn out to be just as fallible as humans.

Katarina Ek had already confessed. The former teacher, whose smart lock data models had enabled apartment burglaries across Västra Hamnen, was now sitting in a cell two floors below Chen Wei's interview room. She'd given up her dark web contacts, the buyers of her trained models, everything. Emil said she seemed almost relieved to be caught, as if carrying the secret had been worse than the crime itself.

Two down. One to go.

Sara drove toward the staging point in Lindängen, just outside Rosengård, where the tactical team was preparing to arrest Yusuf Hassan. She listened to Emil's updates through her earpiece.

"Surveillance confirms he's in the apartment. Lights on, third floor. Heat signature through the thermal imager. Team is ready to breach on your signal."

She pulled into the parking area behind a panel van marked with a telecommunications company logo—mobile command post. Inside, eight officers in tactical gear reviewed the floor plan on a tablet.

"Standard approach," the team leader said. "Stairwell and fire escape simultaneously. Digital forensics van is standing by to grab any devices before he can wipe them. Subject is non-violent but considered a flight risk."

Sara nodded. "Execute."

She watched through the van's camera feeds as the team moved in. Textbook precision. Up the stairs, down the hallway, ram on the door, breach and clear.

The apartment was empty.

"What?" Sara grabbed the tablet, cycling through camera views. The apartment had clearly been occupied recently—computer equipment, clothes, food in the kitchen. But no Yusuf Hassan.

"Heat signature was a space heater on a timer," one of the officers reported. "Lights on smart switches, scheduled to make it look occupied. We've been spoofed."

Emil's voice crackled through her earpiece. "Sara, we have a problem. I just found a file on the dark web forum where Yusuf posts. Timestamped two hours ago. It's a trained model."

"A model of what?"

"Police raid patterns. Response times, breach procedures, typical staging locations. He's been scraping public records, news reports, leaked operational documents. He built an adversarial model specifically to predict how we'd come for him."

Sara felt the familiar sinking sensation. Always two steps behind. "So he knew we were coming."

"He knew before we knew. The moment Chen Wei started talking, or Katarina was arrested, his model probably flagged it as a threat trigger. He's been running his own predictive analytics on the investigation the whole time."

The tactical team leader looked at Sara. "We can put out an alert, check known associates, watch transit hubs—"

"He's not running." Sara was suddenly certain. "He's too smart for that. Running makes you visible. He'll hide in plain sight, somewhere we wouldn't think to look immediately."

"Where?"

Sara thought about everything Emil had told her about Yusuf Hassan. The algorithm broker from Rosengård who refused to leave his neighborhood even when he could afford to. Who saw himself as fighting back against a system that had written him off. Who was popular in the community, protective of it.

"He's still in Rosengård," she said. "Somewhere public, where we'd look suspicious raiding. Somewhere with witnesses."

Emil's voice: "The community center. He volunteers there, teaches coding to kids. It's two blocks from his apartment."

Sara was already moving toward her car. "Tell the team to stand down. I'm going in alone."

"Sara, that's against—"

"I know. If I'm wrong, it's on me. But if he built a model of how we'd raid his apartment, he has a model of how we'd raid the community center too. Tactical team, media attention, scared kids—it would be a disaster. He's counting on us not wanting that."

Silence on the line. Then Emil: "Understood. But I'm tracking your phone. If anything goes wrong—"

"You'll get there in time to write the report." She almost smiled. "Trust me, Emil."

"I do. That's why I'm worried."

---

The Rosengård Community Center was a low concrete building from the 1970s, remodeled sometime in the last decade with bright paint and solar panels. Sara parked across the street and watched for a moment. Through the windows she could see the main room: folding tables, plastic chairs, a few people working on laptops. After-school programs wouldn't start for another hour, so it was mostly empty.

She counted four exits. If Yusuf had planned this, he'd have an escape route. But something told her he wasn't planning to run—not yet. He wanted to see how she'd move.

Sara walked in through the front door.

The interior smelled like floor cleaner and coffee. A bulletin board advertised Swedish classes, job training programs, a youth coding workshop. Behind the main desk, a woman in her fifties looked up from paperwork.

"Can I help you?"

"I'm looking for Yusuf Hassan." Sara showed her police identification. "I believe he's here."

The woman's expression cooled immediately. "He's in the computer lab. What's this about?"

"I just need to speak with him."

"Are you arresting him?"

"Not at the moment."

The woman considered this. "Computer lab is down the hall. Last door on the left. But there are kids in there sometimes. Whatever this is, please keep it calm."

Sara nodded and walked down the hall, feeling exposed. Anyone here could be watching, recording. If this went wrong, it would be very public.

The computer lab was a repurposed classroom with a dozen workstations along the walls. Only one was occupied. Yusuf Hassan sat with his back to the door, three monitors arranged in front of him, fingers moving across a keyboard.

"You should be in Lindängen right now," he said without turning around. "At the staging point behind the panel van. The tactical team went into my apartment at 14:04. Found the heater timer, I assume?"

Sara closed the door behind her. "You knew we were coming."

"I've known for days. Your investigation has a rhythm. Arrest patterns, interrogation times, search warrant processing speeds. It's all predictable once you have enough data." He swiveled his chair around to face her. "You're Detective Sara Lindqvist. Forty-one years old. Economic Crime Division. Your father Erik worked at Limhamn Harbor until the automation wave in 2019. He died three years later. You've been investigating algorithmic crime for seven months, working with Emil Bergström, who is currently very worried about you. He's checking your GPS location every thirty seconds."

Sara kept her expression neutral. "Impressive research."

"It's not research. It's pattern recognition. You leave data exhaust everywhere—arrest records, court filings, your father's obituary. I just trained a model to understand your decision patterns." Yusuf gestured at his screens. "Would you like to see the prediction tree? There was an eighty-three percent probability you'd come here alone."

"Then you know why I'm here."

"You've arrested Chen Wei and Katarina Ek. You have evidence of my dark web activities, the pharmacy robberies, the trained models I've sold. You have enough for charges." He leaned back. "So why aren't there twenty officers outside right now?"

Sara pulled out a chair and sat down across from him. Treating this like an interrogation would fail—he'd predicted that approach. So she tried something else: the truth.

"Because arresting you doesn't solve anything," she said. "We arrest you, you go to prison, maybe serve three years if you're lucky. Meanwhile, ten more algorithm brokers appear to fill the gap. The systems you exploited are still vulnerable. The economic pressures that pushed Katarina and Chen into crime haven't changed. We win one case and lose the war."

Yusuf studied her carefully. "So what do you want?"

"I want to understand. Really understand. Not just the technical details—Emil can reverse-engineer your code. I want to understand why someone with your skills chose this path."

He laughed, but there was no humor in it. "You read my file. You know why. I have a computer science degree from Malmö University. I was top of my class. I applied to forty-seven tech companies in Sweden. Do you know how many interviews I got?"

"Tell me."

"Three. One offered me a support desk position. The other two said I 'wouldn't be a good cultural fit.'" He gestured around them. "I grew up here. In Rosengård. That address is flagged in every background check, every algorithmic screening system. HR departments use ML models to filter candidates, and those models learned from historical hiring data. Historical data that's riddled with bias. The algorithms predicted I'd fail, so they made sure I failed."

"So you decided to beat them."

"I decided to expose them. Every exploit I create, every adversarial attack I teach, it's proof that these systems aren't neutral. They're not objective. They're weapons dressed up as efficiency tools." Yusuf's voice grew harder. "Katarina Ek was a teacher. She got fired during budget cuts and couldn't find work except cleaning rich people's apartments. She has a daughter to support. The system that replaced her with automated learning software also created the data exhaust she could sell for survival. That's not a bug. That's the design."

Sara thought about her father, about Petri the dockworker who'd spotted the ghost containers. About her own creeping fear of obsolescence. "You're not wrong," she said. "But the pharmacies you robbed? They serve people in Möllevången and Rosengård. Working people who need their medication. You hurt your own community."

For the first time, Yusuf's confidence wavered. "Collateral damage."

"Is that what you tell yourself?"

He looked away. "I made sure the insurance covered it. I verified the pharmacies could absorb the loss. It was just money."

"It's never just money. Every crime has a victim, even if you don't see their face." Sara leaned forward. "Here's what I think: You're brilliant. You saw the flaws in these systems before most people knew they existed. And you're angry—rightfully angry—about how those systems treated you and people like you. But this path? It doesn't change anything. It just proves to the people who wrote you off that they were right to be afraid."

"So I should just accept it? Keep applying for jobs that will never hire me? Play by rules that are rigged?"

"No. You should help us change the rules."

Yusuf blinked. "What?"

Sara pulled out her phone and set it on the table between them. "Emil Bergström is listening. So is my supervisor. What I'm about to offer is not officially sanctioned, and if you reject it, I'll have to arrest you right now. But here's the deal: You testify. About all of it—the dark web markets, the ML model exploits, the systemic vulnerabilities you've discovered. You help us understand how these systems are being gamed so we can actually defend against it. And in exchange, we recommend community service and probation instead of prison time."

"Community service?"

"Teaching. You work with Emil to train police forensics teams on adversarial ML. You help us build defenses instead of attacks. You prove that someone from Rosengård can be exactly what the system said you couldn't: an expert who makes things better instead of worse."

Yusuf stared at her. "You're serious."

"Completely. But it's a one-time offer. Once I walk out this door, it's off the table. The tactical team will be back within the hour with enough officers to lock down this whole block. Your model might predict individual moves, but you can't predict chaos. They'll get you eventually."

"And if I help you, I become a traitor. A snitch. That's how people here will see it."

"Maybe. Or maybe they'll see someone who found a different way to fight. Someone who's proving that the system can be changed from the inside." Sara stood up. "I'm not asking you to trust the police. I'm asking you to trust that this moment—right now—is a decision point. You can keep beating the system one exploit at a time, or you can help build a system that doesn't need to be beaten."

Yusuf looked at his monitors, at the prediction models and escape routes he'd so carefully prepared. "I trained a model on this exact scenario. You offering a deal, trying to flip me. The optimal response is to refuse and execute the exit strategy."

"Then why haven't you?"

He met her eyes. "Because the model can't account for the fact that you're right. Beating the system once doesn't change the system. It just makes me better at being invisible." He was quiet for a long moment. "I'm tired of being invisible."

Sara held out her hand. "Then let's make you impossible to ignore."

Yusuf Hassan stood up and shook it.

---

Emil met them in the parking lot thirty minutes later, forensics van following. Yusuf surrendered his laptops, phones, and external drives without resistance. The handcuffs were a formality—he wasn't going to run now.

"That was either brilliant or career-ending," Emil said quietly to Sara as they watched Yusuf being processed. "Depends on how the prosecutor's office reacts."

"I'll handle it. You just make sure his testimony is documented properly. Everything about the smuggling network, the dark web markets, the model architectures. We need it all."

"Already started. Chen Wei's statement combined with Yusuf's technical knowledge—we can take down the entire algorithmic crime ecosystem. At least this generation of it." Emil looked tired but less cynical than usual. "You know another one will grow back."

"Probably. But maybe we'll understand it better next time. Maybe we won't be two steps behind." She watched as Yusuf was led to the police van. He looked back at the community center, at the building where he'd taught coding to kids who looked like him, who faced the same algorithmic discrimination he'd endured.

He'd made his choice. Now Sara had to make sure the system kept its end of the bargain.

Her phone rang: her supervisor. She took a breath and answered.

"Sara, I've been briefed on the community center situation. This deal you offered—"

"I know it was outside protocol—"

"It was smart. Risky, but smart. The Commissioner wants to meet with you tomorrow. Apparently there's talk of forming a specialized task force for algorithmic crime. They want someone who understands both the technical and human elements." A pause. "Congratulations, Detective. You just made solving this case harder on yourself."

Sara almost laughed. "How's that?"

"Because now you'll be responsible for fixing the mess. Not just catching criminals, but understanding why they exist in the first place. That's a much bigger job."

The call ended. Emil raised an eyebrow. "Good news?"

"I think so. Hard to tell."

They stood in the parking lot as winter darkness fell over Rosengård. In the community center windows, lights were coming on for the evening programs. Kids arriving for after-school activities, parents dropping them off, the daily rhythm of a neighborhood that had been written off by algorithms but kept existing anyway.

"You know what the really adversarial thing is?" Emil said. "Not attacking the system. Trusting someone the system said you shouldn't trust."

Sara thought about Yusuf's prediction model, the one that gave her an eighty-three percent probability of coming alone. "He knew I'd do it. He just had to believe I meant it."

"Did you?"

"Yes. And now we have to make sure we deliver."

They drove back to headquarters through the Malmö evening, three suspects in custody, three cases breaking open simultaneously. The port smuggling network exposed. The apartment burglary ring stopped. The pharmacy robberies solved. By conventional measures, it was a victory.

But Sara knew the real work was just beginning. Chen Wei would testify and disappear into witness protection, forever looking over her shoulder. Katarina Ek would serve time, her daughter growing up with the knowledge of what economic desperation had driven her mother to do. And Yusuf Hassan would spend the next year teaching police officers about systems he'd once exploited, trying to change a machine that had already decided what he was worth.

The algorithm predicted they'd all fail.

Sara was determined to prove it wrong.
