# Chapter 8

The call came at seven forty-three in the morning, pulling Reeves from his third reading of Dr. Chen's final autopsy report. Victoria Sterling's name glowed on his phone screen.

"Detective Reeves." He wedged the phone between shoulder and ear, freeing his hands to shuffle through the scattered documents on his desk.

"Detective, I hope I'm not disturbing you." Victoria's voice carried that particular quality of old Boston—clipped consonants, elongated vowels, the kind of accent that came from generations of private schools and country clubs. "One doesn't wish to be a bother, but something has been troubling me."

Reeves straightened in his chair. In his experience, when Beacon Hill matriarchs said they were troubled, it usually meant they'd noticed something the rest of the world had missed. "Not at all, Mrs. Sterling. What's on your mind?"

"It's Dr. Harrington." A pause, filled with the sound of fine china meeting a saucer. "Olivia Harrington. You spoke with her, I believe?"

"I did." Reeves pulled a fresh legal pad toward him, uncapped a pen. "What about her?"

"Well, it's only that—" Victoria stopped, and Reeves could picture her, sitting in that meticulously preserved drawing room, choosing her words with the same care she'd choose pearls for an opera. "Dr. Harrington and my husband were quite close. She was his student, oh, twenty years ago now, but they remained in contact. She would visit every few weeks, sometimes for dinner, sometimes just to use his library. He was—one gathered—something of a mentor to her."

"I see." Reeves wrote: *Harrington-Sterling: regular contact, mentor relationship*.

"After Jonathan's death, I received, well, an overwhelming number of condolence calls. The Montgomerys, the Ashworths, even that dreadful Thomas Pemberton from the Harvard Club." Another delicate pause. "But Dr. Harrington hasn't called. Not once. She hasn't written. She hasn't attended the memorial service planning committee. It's as if—and I don't mean to sound dramatic, Detective—it's as if she's avoiding me entirely."

Reeves felt something shift in his chest, that familiar tightness that came when a scattered pattern suddenly showed its outline. "That does seem unusual."

"More than unusual, Detective. It's positively odd. Dr. Harrington and I weren't intimate friends, but we were certainly cordial. We shared a fondness for Baroque music. She would often stay for coffee after her visits with Jonathan." Victoria's voice softened. "One would think, given their connection, that she would reach out. Unless—"

She didn't finish the thought. She didn't have to.

"Thank you for telling me this, Mrs. Sterling," Reeves said. "I know it can't be easy, with everything you're managing right now."

"One does what one must, Detective." The phone clicked off, leaving Reeves staring at his notes.

*Avoiding contact with the widow.* He underlined it twice. Why would Harrington, who had maintained a professional friendship with both Sterlings for two decades, suddenly vanish after the death? Grief? Or guilt?

He was still contemplating the question when Ethan Cross appeared in his doorway, carrying two paper coffee cups and what looked like a file folder thick enough to serve as a doorstop.

"You look like you've been here all night," Ethan said, handing over one of the cups.

"Most of it." Reeves took the coffee gratefully. Black, no sugar, the way Ethan had learned he preferred it after their third late night working together. "What's that?"

"Background on Dr. Harrington." Ethan dropped into the chair across from Reeves' desk. "You said you wanted her history, so I got her history. Medical school transcripts, employment records, publication list—she's written like sixty papers, by the way, mostly on cardiac pharmacology—and I pulled some, uh, more personal stuff too."

"Personal stuff." Reeves raised an eyebrow.

"I got a friend who works at Mass General, asked some questions." Ethan shrugged. "Nothin' illegal. Just water cooler talk. Turns out Dr. Harrington's got a reputation. Brilliant, total professional, but kind of distant. Doesn't socialize much. Lost her mother about eight years ago, took it real hard."

"Lost her mother how?"

Ethan flipped open the folder, scanning through pages until he found what he wanted. "ALS. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. That's the one where—"

"Where you lose all muscle control." Reeves had studied neurodegenerative diseases during his physics PhD, back when he'd thought understanding the universe meant understanding particles and waves. Before he'd learned that the real mysteries were human ones. "Progressive paralysis. Eventually you can't speak, can't swallow, can't breathe. But your mind stays completely intact."

"Yeah." Ethan's face showed the kind of uncomfortable sympathy people got when contemplating the truly awful deaths. "Says here her mom lived eighteen months after diagnosis. Dr. Harrington took a leave from Mass General to care for her full-time."

Reeves took the folder, reading through the carefully compiled timeline. Sarah Harrington, diagnosed at sixty-two. Olivia Harrington, her only child, putting her career on hold to become a full-time caretaker. Hospice care in the final three months. Death at age sixty-three, in her daughter's home, with her daughter at her bedside.

"Eighteen months," Reeves said quietly. "Eighteen months of watching your mother suffocate by inches."

"There's more." Ethan pulled out another sheet. "I found an interview she did with the ALS Association a few years after. Fundraising thing. She talks about how the hardest part wasn't the physical care, it was the helplessness. She's a doctor, right? Someone who fixes hearts for a living. But there was nothin' she could do. No cure, no treatment that really worked. Just—waiting."

Reeves read the interview excerpt:

*"As a physician, I'm trained to intervene, to cure, to heal. But with ALS, there is no intervention that matters. You can only witness. My mother was a vibrant, intelligent woman, and I had to watch her become a prisoner in her own body. The cruelty of it—the absolute pointlessness of that suffering—it changed how I think about medicine. About mercy."*

"About mercy," Reeves repeated. He set the paper down, stared at it. Something was forming in his mind, a theory that felt almost blasphemous to speak aloud. "Ethan, what if—"

He stopped. Wait. What if what? What if Harrington had developed a philosophy about ending suffering? What if watching her mother's prolonged death had convinced her that some deaths were kinder than others? What if she'd looked at Jonathan Sterling—cruel, destroying careers, causing pain—and decided he didn't deserve to keep breathing while her mother had fought so hard for every breath?

But that was motive, not method. And they still had no method. No poison, no evidence, nothing but an inexplicable hypoxic cell damage that could have a dozen explanations.

"What if what?" Ethan prompted.

Reeves shook his head. "Nothing. Not yet. It's just—there's a pattern here. Sterling destroys lives systematically, methodically, for years. Harrington watches her mother's life destroyed by random cellular malfunction. Both involve suffering, both involve powerlessness. But one is chosen cruelty and one is biological inevitability."

"And you think that matters to her?"

"I think everything matters to her. She's a cardiologist specializing in pharmacology. She understands how the body works at the molecular level. She understands cause and effect, action and reaction." Reeves stood, pacing to the window. Seven days since Sterling's death. Seven days of chasing shadows and circumstantial evidence. "If you wanted to stop someone from causing more suffering, and you had the knowledge to make it look like natural causes, would that feel like murder? Or would it feel like—"

"Mercy," Ethan finished, his voice quiet.

They sat in silence for a moment. Outside, Boston was waking up—commuters hurrying through the February cold, buses hissing to stops, the city's perpetual motion machine grinding forward. People living and dying, suffering and enduring, completely unaware that two men in a homicide office were trying to prove that one particular death had been chosen rather than random.

"She's avoiding Victoria Sterling," Reeves said finally. "That's what you do when you can't face someone. When you're carrying guilt."

"Or when you're grieving and can't handle the widow's grief on top of your own," Ethan countered. "My aunt did the same thing when her best friend died. Couldn't make the funeral, couldn't call, nothin'. She felt terrible about it, but she just—couldn't."

"Your aunt didn't have detailed knowledge of undetectable poisons."

"True." Ethan leaned back in his chair. "So what do we do? We still can't prove she did anything. Chen's report is final—natural causes, no toxins detected. Harrington's got an alibi. The book is missing but that's not evidence of murder, it's evidence of a missing book."

Reeves returned to his desk, spreading out everything they had. The autopsy report. The background on Harrington. The timeline of Sterling's destroyed careers. The library records showing the borrowed book about historical poisons. Victoria's observation about Harrington's strange absence.

Pieces of a puzzle that should fit together but didn't, like he was trying to force them into the wrong configuration.

"We dig deeper," he said. "Into Harrington's research, her lab access, her chemical orders for the past year. If she synthesized something, she had to get the raw materials somewhere. She had to test it, refine it. Scientists don't just wake up one morning and create a perfect poison."

"That's gonna take time," Ethan warned. "Months, maybe. And Captain Walsh is already askin' when we're gonna close this case."

"Then we work fast." Reeves pulled up his email, began drafting a formal request for Harrington's employment records, research logs, laboratory inventory access. "And we hope she made a mistake somewhere. Because brilliant people always do, eventually. They get confident. They start believing they really are smarter than everyone else."

"You think she believes that?"

Reeves thought about Harrington in her office at Mass General, so poised, so perfectly helpful. The way she'd admitted motive openly, as if honesty itself was proof of innocence. The way she'd explained the delayed-release poison theory as a purely academic exercise.

"I think," he said slowly, "that she believes she did something necessary. And necessary things don't feel like crimes. They feel like solutions."

Ethan was quiet for a moment, then: "My grandmother used to say that the devil never looks like the devil. He looks like everything you've ever wanted."

"What does that have to do with this?"

"I'm sayin' maybe we're lookin' for a monster, but what if she's not? What if she's just someone who saw a problem and solved it, and now she gets to walk away clean because she's brilliant enough to make it look like God did it instead?"

Reeves met his eyes. "Then we prove God didn't do it. We prove someone did. And we prove it was her."

"And if we can't?"

The question hung in the air between them, heavy with implication. If they couldn't prove it, then what? A murderer walks free because she was smart enough, careful enough, to make the impossible possible? Justice defeated by intelligence?

"We will," Reeves said, but even he could hear the uncertainty in his voice.

Ethan gathered up the background files, stood to leave, then paused at the door. "For what it's worth? I think you're right about her. I got a feelin', you know? When I look at the crime scene photos—and yeah, I know, I know, feelings aren't evidence—but there's somethin' about the whole setup that feels wrong. Like someone arranged everything just a little too carefully."

"What do you mean?"

"I dunno exactly. It's just—when I'm shootin' crime scenes, I can tell the difference between chaos and staged chaos. Real disasters, they got this randomness to 'em. But Sterling's study, it's too..." He gestured vaguely. "Too neat. Like someone tidied up after the death, made sure everything looked natural."

Reeves felt that tightness in his chest again. "You're saying the scene was staged."

"I'm sayin' it *feels* staged. But I can't prove that, and feelin's don't hold up in court, so." Ethan shrugged. "I'll keep diggin' into her background. Maybe somethin'll turn up."

When he left, Reeves returned to the window, watching the city move below him. Somewhere out there, Olivia Harrington was starting her day. Making rounds at Mass General, consulting on cardiac cases, teaching medical students the intricate machinery of the human heart.

Living a perfectly normal life, as if she hadn't committed the perfect murder.

*About mercy,* she'd said in that interview. *The absolute pointlessness of that suffering—it changed how I think about medicine.*

Reeves understood suffering. He understood the impulse to end it. His mentor, Webb, had died slowly too, though not from disease. From despair, from the weight of an unsolved case that ate at him until there was nothing left. Reeves had watched that death from a distance, powerless to intervene, just like Harrington had watched her mother.

But Webb's death had been ruled a suicide, and Reeves had never believed it. Never proved otherwise either.

History repeating itself. The brilliant detective unable to prove what he knows to be true. Condemned to watch a murderer walk free because the evidence doesn't exist, or because he's not smart enough to find it.

No. Not this time.

He turned back to his desk, to the piles of documents and dead-end leads, and began to work. Somewhere in all this information was the thread that would unravel Harrington's perfect crime. He just had to find it before Captain Walsh closed the case, before the trail went completely cold, before another person died because he'd been too slow, too methodical, too afraid of being wrong.

Outside, the city kept moving. Inside, Marcus Reeves kept searching.

And somewhere in Boston, Dr. Olivia Harrington went about her day, not knowing that her past was being excavated, her mother's death analyzed, her carefully constructed alibi examined from every possible angle.

Not knowing that the one thing she couldn't control—human behavior, the small social graces that separate the guilty from the grieving—had already started to give her away.
