# Chapter 8: Systematic Exploitation

The Apotek Hjärtat in Värnhem looked ordinary in December daylight. Sara stood outside the pharmacy, watching customers push through the glass doors, their breath fogging in the cold air. Three weeks ago, someone had walked in during a precise seventeen-second window when the security cameras were rebooting, emptied the high-value medication cabinet, and disappeared without leaving a single useful image.

Professional work. The kind that required understanding the system well enough to make it obsolete.

Inside, the pharmacy manager—a tired woman named Bergman—pulled up the security interface on her tablet. "SecureWatch assured us their randomization was unhackable," she said, scrolling through logs. "That was their whole pitch. 'True randomness prevents predictable patterns.'"

"Nothing is unhackable," Emil said from behind Sara. He'd been up all night tracing Trustpilot accounts, his eyes red-rimmed but sharp. "Can you show us the exact maintenance schedule?"

Bergman tapped through screens. The SecureWatch system displayed a dashboard of green indicators—camera status, door sensors, motion detection, all supposedly monitored by machine learning algorithms that adapted to threats in real-time. "The system reboots cameras at random intervals," she explained. "SecureWatch said it prevents people from timing attacks because there's no pattern to exploit."

"Except there is," Emil said quietly. "Random doesn't mean unpredictable if you control the seed."

Sara watched Bergman's face register confusion. She knew that look—it was the same expression her father wore when dock supervisors explained that algorithms would be making scheduling decisions now, that the system would be more efficient, that human experience was being replaced by machine learning models that never got tired or asked for raises.

"Can you explain it?" Sara asked Emil. Not because she couldn't follow, but because Bergman deserved to understand how her security had been defeated.

Emil nodded, patient as always. "True randomness is hard for computers. They use pseudorandom number generators—algorithms that produce numbers that look random but are actually determined by a starting value called a seed. SecureWatch's system uses environmental inputs to generate that seed. Temperature sensors, customer traffic counts, even sentiment analysis from online reviews."

"Trustpilot," Sara said.

"Trustpilot," Emil confirmed. "Someone created fake accounts, posted reviews timed to specific dates, and manipulated the sentiment scores that fed into SecureWatch's randomization algorithm. They poisoned the seed."

Bergman sat down heavily. "So when I thought the system was generating random camera reboot times..."

"It was," Emil said. "But if you know the inputs, you can predict the outputs. They didn't hack your cameras. They hacked the randomness itself."

Sara pulled out her notebook—actual paper, not a tablet, because she thought better with a pen in her hand. "Who installed your SecureWatch system?"

"Security consultant recommended them. We contracted with them eight months ago." Bergman pulled up the contract details. "They promised adaptive security powered by machine learning. Said it was the future."

The future. Sara wrote that down, though she wasn't sure why. Maybe because it kept coming up—this idea that algorithms were the future, that human judgment was the past, that optimization and efficiency would solve everything. Her father had heard the same promises about port automation. The future turned out to be him dying alone in a too-quiet apartment, his skills obsolete, his purpose erased.

"We need the installation records," Sara said. "Who had access to configure the system, who knew the architecture, who could have understood the randomization methodology well enough to reverse-engineer it."

Bergman promised to send everything. As they left, Sara noticed the pharmacist behind the counter—a young woman, maybe late twenties, carefully counting pills into orange bottles. Precise work, skilled work, the kind that required years of training. How long before an automated dispensary replaced her too? How long before she became data exhaust, her labor patterns analyzed and optimized until human pharmacists were just an inefficiency to eliminate?

Kronans Apotek in Möllevången told the same story. Different pharmacy manager, same SecureWatch system, same seventeen-second window exploited with surgical precision. The third pharmacy, in Triangeln, showed identical technical signatures.

"They're not improvising," Sara said as they sat in Emil's forensics lab that afternoon. The cave of monitors displayed synchronized timelines from all four pharmacies, red markers indicating the exact moments cameras went dark. "This is rehearsed. Tested. They knew exactly what they were doing."

Emil zoomed in on the Trustpilot account creation patterns he'd been tracing all night. His screen showed a network graph—fake accounts connected by timing, IP addresses, writing style analysis. "Thirty-seven accounts," he said. "Created over six weeks. Each posted reviews for businesses using SecureWatch systems. The reviews are grammatically correct, contextually appropriate, and timed to maximize sentiment impact on the randomization algorithm."

"Can you trace them back to a person?"

"Tor exit nodes, cryptocurrency tumblers, air-gapped systems." Emil rubbed his eyes. "Whoever did this knows operational security. But..." He pulled up a code sample, text highlighted in green. "The sentiment analysis manipulation shows sophisticated understanding of natural language processing. And the timing precision suggests automated tooling—scripts, not manual review posting."

"University educated," Sara said.

"At minimum. Computer science, probably ML specialization." Emil switched screens to show forum posts he'd connected to the pharmacy cases. "I've been tracking the NullGradient vendor profile. They're active in security research communities, discussions about algorithmic bias, fairness in ML systems. The technical level is consistent with graduate education."

Sara studied the forum screenshots. One post caught her eye: "Algorithms aren't neutral. They encode the biases of their creators and the datasets they're trained on. If a system is designed to oppress, demonstrating its vulnerabilities isn't criminal—it's necessary."

"That reads like ideology," she said.

"Or rationalization," Emil said. "Hard to tell the difference sometimes. But look at what they're selling." He pulled up the NullGradient vendor page on Enigma Market. Tools for bypassing facial recognition systems. Adversarial attacks on automated border control. Methods for spoofing IoT device signatures. "Everything they sell is targeted at surveillance and security infrastructure. Not financial systems, not personal data theft. They're attacking automation itself."

Like someone who'd been hurt by it. Like someone who'd watched it destroy something they cared about.

Sara thought of her father again, inevitable as breathing. He'd never fought back against the port automation. He just... faded. Drank more, slept less, stopped talking about work because there was no work to talk about. The algorithms had decided he was obsolete, and he'd accepted their judgment.

But someone else might have refused to accept it. Someone younger, smarter, angrier. Someone who looked at algorithmic discrimination and thought: if the system is the weapon, I'll learn to use it better than the people who built it.

"We need to find them," Sara said.

"Define 'find.'" Emil's voice carried his characteristic exhaustion-tinged sarcasm. "I can narrow the geographic correlation, track forum activity patterns, analyze technical signatures. But this person—whoever they are—they're professional grade operational security. No real names, no faces, no physical meetings we can identify. They're smoke."

"Smoke has a source."

"Sure. But by the time you see smoke, the fire's already somewhere else." Emil turned back to his monitors. "I'll keep tracing. But Sara... even if we identify NullGradient, they're just one vendor. Their toolkit has been downloaded 127 times. That's 127 potential operations, maybe hundreds of individual crimes. We catch one person, the tools are still out there."

"So we're playing whack-a-mole," Sara said.

"We're playing whack-a-mole against an exponentially reproducing mole population," Emil corrected. "While blindfolded. And the moles are better at this than we are."

Sara stood up, walked to the window. Outside, Malmö spread out in winter gray—the old brick buildings of Möllevången, the gleaming glass of new construction, the distant spike of Turning Torso piercing the clouds. A city layered with surveillance, every surface generating data exhaust, every system optimizing itself based on patterns most people didn't know existed.

"The SecureWatch contract said they consulted with multiple pharmacies," she said, thinking out loud. "If we can get their client list, we can warn the others. Prevent future robberies."

"They'll lawyer up," Emil said. "Claim proprietary methodology, trade secrets. And even if we get the list, what do we tell them? 'Your random security system isn't random enough because someone on the internet figured out how to manipulate online reviews to poison the algorithm's seed generation'? They'll think we're insane."

He was right. The crime was too technical, too abstract, too far removed from the traditional breaking-and-entering that judges and juries understood. How do you explain adversarial machine learning to a courtroom? How do you prove criminal intent when the attack vector is fake pharmacy reviews on Trustpilot?

"We document everything," Sara said finally. "Build the case even if it's hard to prosecute. Someone needs to understand this."

"Why?" Emil's question was quiet, almost gentle. "I mean it, Sara. Why are we doing this? We can barely keep up with the crimes we know about. There are probably dozens more we haven't even identified. The criminals innovate faster than we can respond. So why?"

Sara turned back from the window. Emil looked very young in the monitor glow, despite his thirty-two years. Tired and cynical but still here, still trying, still building technical architectures to trace ghosts through digital smoke.

"Because someone has to," she said. "Because if we don't, no one will. Because the alternative is accepting that algorithmic crime is just the new normal and we should stop pretending law enforcement can do anything about it."

Emil was quiet for a moment. Then he nodded and turned back to his screens. "Okay. Let me trace these Trustpilot accounts back as far as I can. Maybe NullGradient made a mistake somewhere. Everyone makes mistakes eventually."

Sara hoped he was right. But she suspected that whoever NullGradient was, they were very good at not making mistakes. The pharmacy robberies weren't crimes of opportunity—they were proof of concept, demonstrations of technical mastery, maybe even teaching exercises.

Someone was showing others how to make systems obsolete. And that someone was very, very good at their work.

Late that evening, Sara sat in her apartment in Värnhem, case files spread across her small kitchen table. She'd deliberately chosen not to live in one of Malmö's smart buildings, had opted for an older place with traditional locks and no IoT devices tracking her habits. Her father would have appreciated the irony—his daughter, investigating algorithmic crimes, refusing to live in an algorithmically optimized space.

The pharmacy victims' statements all said the same thing in different words: they'd trusted the technology. SecureWatch had promised adaptive security, machine learning, state-of-the-art randomization. And the technology had worked exactly as designed. The vulnerability wasn't a bug—it was the system itself.

Her phone buzzed. Emil, sending screenshots of more Trustpilot accounts, more evidence of systematic manipulation. The fake reviews read like they were written by real people—frustrated customers, satisfied clients, ordinary human feedback. Except they weren't human at all. They were algorithmic ammunition, carefully calibrated inputs designed to poison a security system's randomness.

Sara thought about the young pharmacist she'd seen that afternoon, counting pills with careful precision. How long before someone figured out how to exploit whatever automation replaced her? How long before every system designed to make work more efficient just created new vulnerabilities, new opportunities for those smart enough to understand the exploitation surface?

She closed the file and stared at the wall. Tomorrow they'd continue tracing. Tomorrow they'd keep building the case. Tomorrow they'd try to stay one step behind instead of two.

But tonight, she just felt tired. Tired of watching systems devour people. Tired of investigations that felt like shoveling smoke. Tired of knowing that even if they caught whoever was behind the pharmacy robberies, the tools and techniques would keep spreading, keep evolving, keep turning every optimization into an attack surface.

Her father had been defeated by automation. She was trying to investigate crimes committed by weaponizing it. The symmetry felt like mockery.

Sara picked up her phone and texted Emil: "Get some sleep. We'll need to be sharp tomorrow."

His response came immediately: "You too, Sara. We'll figure this out."

She wanted to believe him. But professional work required professional evidence, and they were chasing someone who understood systems better than the people who built them. Someone invisible by being algorithmic. Someone who'd learned that the future her father had been promised was just a more sophisticated kind of weapon.

And that someone was still out there, still training others, still demonstrating that every security system was just a pattern waiting to be recognized and exploited.

Sara turned off her phone and went to bed, knowing tomorrow would bring more ghost-chasing, more technical forensics, more evidence of crimes that most people wouldn't understand and couldn't prevent.

The future was already here. It just wasn't evenly distributed—and neither was the ability to exploit it.
