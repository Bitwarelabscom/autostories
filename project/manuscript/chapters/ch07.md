# Chapter 7: Pattern Recognition

The pharmacy robberies started appearing in Sara's case queue three weeks after Limhamn. Four incidents across Malmö, each separated by days. Professional, clean, no violence. The kind of crimes that would normally merit a single detective's attention, filed under property crime, cleared when convenient.

But Sara had learned to recognize the signature.

She spread the incident reports across her desk in the Economic Crime Division's open office. Tuesday morning, 9:15 AM, the fluorescent lights humming overhead like tinnitus. Outside the window, December rain turned Malmö into watercolor grays.

Apotek Hjärtat in Värnhem. Kronans Apotek in Möllevången. Two different chains in Triangeln. Each time: employee arrives to open, finds the door unlocked, cash register emptied, high-value medications gone. Security footage shows nothing. Not corrupted, not missing. Just nothing. Cameras reboot exactly when the robberies occur.

"You're seeing it too."

Emil set a coffee cup on her desk, pulled a chair over. He looked worse than usual—hair unwashed, the particular exhaustion that came from spending too many hours staring at code.

"The timing," Sara said.

"The timing." He opened his laptop, pulled up a timeline visualization. Four incidents, four perfect gaps in surveillance coverage. "Every pharmacy uses the same security provider—SecureWatch. Their cameras run scheduled maintenance reboots. Supposed to be randomized for security. Three AM, give or take thirty minutes."

"Supposed to be."

"Right. Except our guy knows exactly when." Emil zoomed in on the first robbery. "Apotek Hjärtat, November 15th. Camera reboot at 3:17 AM. Break-in at 3:18. Employee discovers it at 7:30 when she arrives."

Sara leaned back. "How does someone know the exact reboot time if it's randomized?"

"That's the question I've been asking for the past forty-eight hours." Emil's fingers moved across the keyboard. "SecureWatch's system is supposed to use entropy—environmental noise, network timing variance, all sorts of chaos theory to make prediction impossible."

"But."

"But." He pulled up a code window. "I got access to one of the pharmacy's systems through a warrant. Found something in the logs. Someone queried the system repeatedly, testing how it responds to different inputs."

"Like the port," Sara said. The ghost containers at Limhamn. Same principle—learn how the AI thinks, then exploit the pattern.

"Exactly like the port." Emil switched screens. "Except this time they're not spoofing sensors. They're triggering the randomization algorithm with specific inputs to force the output they want."

Sara felt the familiar sensation of standing at the edge of understanding. "Explain it like I'm not a computer scientist."

Emil thought for a moment. "You know those old scams where someone calls and pretends to be from your bank?"

"Social engineering."

"Right. This is algorithmic social engineering. The randomizer pulls data from multiple sources to create unpredictability. Weather data, network traffic, system load. So our guy creates fake reviews on Trustpilot."

Sara blinked. "Reviews."

"Reviews of the pharmacies. The SecureWatch system monitors online mentions as part of its threat assessment—if a location gets negative reviews, it adjusts security sensitivity. So someone creates a specific pattern of reviews. The timing, the word count, the sentiment scores. The AI ingests that data, processes it, and that affects the random seed for the maintenance reboot."

"You're telling me someone can schedule a camera reboot by writing bad pharmacy reviews."

"Not bad reviews. Specific reviews. The algorithm doesn't understand meaning, just pattern. I traced the Trustpilot accounts back—all created within hours of each other, all with similar posting patterns. Someone trained a model to generate exactly the right inputs to push the randomizer toward a desired output time."

Sara picked up her coffee, found it already cold. "Did you bring this to SecureWatch?"

"Called them yesterday. They're 'reviewing the findings.' Which means they're terrified and lawyering up." Emil's smile was bleak. "They sold this system to half the commercial buildings in Malmö. If word gets out that you can hack their randomization through online reviews..."

"Every system they protect becomes vulnerable."

"Already is vulnerable. We just didn't know it."

Sara looked at the incident reports again. Four pharmacies. Probably tens of thousands in stolen medications and cash. "What else did you find?"

Emil's expression shifted. "That's where it gets interesting. Or terrifying. Haven't decided which." He closed the code windows, opened a browser with the address bar masked. "I started looking at where someone learns to do this. Adversarial attacks on randomization algorithms aren't exactly common knowledge."

The page loaded. Dark background, encrypted chat interface, marketplace listings. Sara recognized the visual language of the dark web from training courses, from cases that went nowhere because the suspects knew how to disappear.

"This is Enigma Market," Emil said. "One of the bigger darknet marketplaces. Used to be drugs and stolen credit cards. Now look."

He scrolled through listings. Sara read the titles with growing unease:

*Adversarial ML Model - Retail Security Systems - €1,200*

*Pre-Trained Attack Vector - Smart Lock Bypasses - Bitcoin Only*

*Complete Toolkit: Surveillance Camera Exploitation - €3,500*

"They're selling the attacks," Sara said.

"They're selling everything. The models, the training data, the target system specifications. It's not just one clever criminal anymore. It's industrialized." He clicked into one listing. "Look at this one. 'Pharmacy Security Bypass Kit. Includes: target system fingerprint, review generator, timing optimizer, extraction scripts. No technical knowledge required.'"

"No technical knowledge required," Sara repeated. The words settled heavy. "This isn't isolated genius. It's accessible."

"It's a service economy." Emil pulled up another marketplace. "There are at least six of these markets that I've found. Some specialize in ML attacks, some in IoT exploits. There are user reviews, vendor reputation systems, escrow services. It's as professional as legitimate software markets."

Sara thought about the ghost containers at Limhamn. The sophistication there had seemed like an outlier, a one-off case requiring exceptional skill. But if the tools were for sale...

"How many people could be doing this?"

"In Malmö? Sweden? Europe?" Emil shrugged. "The barriers to entry are dropping every day. You don't need to be a data scientist anymore. You just need Bitcoin and no conscience."

"And we have how many people who understand this in the entire police force?"

"You're looking at him." Emil's exhaustion was more visible now. "Cybercrime division has me plus two junior analysts. National center has maybe twenty people who could analyze adversarial ML attacks. There are probably hundreds of people selling these tools, thousands buying them."

The arithmetic was brutal. Sara had felt it at Limhamn—the sensation of being structurally outmatched. Now the scope was clearer.

"Show me the vendors," she said.

Emil navigated to a vendor profile. Username: NullGradient. Member since August. Forty-seven reviews, all five stars. Specialization: adversarial ML attacks against surveillance and security systems.

Sara read the reviews. Professional, detailed feedback. *"Clean code, worked exactly as described. Hit three targets with zero complications."* Another: *"Best support I've had from any vendor. Helped me adapt the model for my local security systems."*

"NullGradient," she said. "Is that our pharmacy guy?"

"Maybe. Or maybe our pharmacy guy bought from NullGradient. I can't tell yet." Emil pulled up a forum thread. "But look at this. Same username, posting in security research forums. Talking about ML vulnerabilities, sharing papers, explaining attack techniques."

The forum posts were technical, dense with jargon. But Sara caught the thread—someone teaching others how to exploit the systems that were supposed to keep people safe.

"Can you trace them?"

"Working on it. They're using good operational security. Tor, cryptocurrency tumblers, air-gapped systems. But people make mistakes." He highlighted a section of forum text. "Here. They mentioned testing an attack on 'local transportation systems.' Could mean Malmö, could mean anywhere. But combined with other data points..."

"You're building a profile."

"I'm trying. The technical signature is clear—this person knows their stuff. University-level computer science, probably focused on machine learning. They're active in communities that discuss algorithmic bias, fairness in AI, that kind of thing."

Sara thought about what kind of person becomes this. Smart enough to understand the systems. Skilled enough to break them. Motivated enough to teach others. "What else?"

Emil pulled up a geographic analysis, dots clustered across a map of Malmö. "This is correlation data. Forum posts, marketplace activity, known attacks that match this technical signature. I ran sentiment analysis on the posts, timeline analysis on activity patterns. There's a cluster."

The dots concentrated in northeast Malmö. Sara recognized the district.

"Rosengård," she said.

"Rosengård." Emil zoomed in. "Could be coincidence. Could be VPN exit points. But combined with the posting times, the language patterns—I think whoever NullGradient is, they're connected to that area."

Rosengård. Immigrant neighborhood, economically marginalized, high unemployment. Also home to some of the most tech-savvy young people in the city. Sara had worked cases there before. Smart kids with no legitimate opportunities, finding other paths.

"So we have someone in Rosengård," Sara said, "who's skilled enough to build these attacks and entrepreneurial enough to sell them. Who's now enabled four pharmacy robberies that we know of."

"At minimum. These markets have download counts." Emil showed her. "NullGradient's security bypass toolkit? Downloaded 127 times in the past three months."

Sara felt the scale shift again. Not four robberies. Potentially hundreds.

"There's something else," Emil said. He pulled up another data visualization. "I started cross-referencing other unsolved crimes in our system. Looking for the signature—perfect timing, surveillance gaps, no physical evidence of entry."

The map populated with markers. Pharmacies, retail stores, and then—

"Turning Torso," Sara said.

"Seven luxury apartments burglarized over the past four months. No signs of forced entry. Security footage shows nothing. Building management assumed inside job, started investigating staff. But look at the pattern."

The timestamps aligned with building system maintenance windows. Smart locks resetting, hallway cameras rebooting, access logs cycling. Same principle as the pharmacies, different target.

"Same technique," Sara said. "Maybe same person, maybe different buyers of the same toolkit."

"We're not chasing criminals anymore," Emil said. "We're chasing a new class of crime. Algorithmic exploitation as a service. And it's not one person we need to stop. It's an entire ecosystem."

Sara stood, walked to the window. Rain obscured Turning Torso in the distance, the twisted spine of glass and steel barely visible. How many ghosts in that machine? How many systems running on algorithms that could be manipulated by anyone with the right tools and enough desperation?

Behind her, Emil kept typing. "I'm going to keep tracing NullGradient. See if I can narrow down the identity. But Sara—even if we find them, arrest them, shut them down—the tools are already out there. The knowledge is distributed."

"I know." She turned back. "But we have to start somewhere."

"We'd need someone on the inside," Emil said, almost to himself. "Someone who understands these markets, who knows how the criminals think."

Sara filed that away. A problem for later, when they understood the scope better.

Her phone buzzed. Text from her captain: *Need to see you. Conference room. Now.*

She showed Emil.

"Jurisdictional?" he guessed.

"Probably." Four pharmacy robberies meant property crime was interested. Darknet markets meant cybercrime wanted involvement. Turning Torso meant organized crime would claim oversight. And none of them had resources to handle it properly.

"I'll keep working," Emil said. "Get me as much time as you can."

Sara gathered the incident reports. Four pharmacy robberies. Seven apartment burglaries. One port smuggling operation. Three different crimes, same underlying technique. And if Emil was right, just the visible edge of something much larger.

In the conference room, her captain waited with two other detectives and someone from the prosecutor's office. Sara recognized the setup. They were going to ask how she wanted to handle this.

But walking down the hallway, Sara realized the question was wrong. It wasn't about handling a case anymore. It was about understanding a system. The criminals weren't individuals to be arrested. They were nodes in a network, participants in an economy that had grown while law enforcement wasn't looking.

She thought about her father. Erik Lindqvist, dockworker, replaced by an automated crane that never got tired and never complained. He'd been made obsolete by a system that optimized for efficiency over humanity.

Now she was investigating crimes committed by people who'd learned to optimize the optimizers. Who'd found invisibility not through hiding, but through looking perfectly normal to the algorithms.

The crime wasn't the robbery. The crime was understanding the system better than the people who built it.

Sara opened the conference room door.

"We have a problem," she said. "And it's bigger than we thought."
