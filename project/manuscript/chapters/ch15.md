# Chapter 15

Sarah Kim was twenty-six years old with a doctorate in biochemistry and hands that trembled when she accepted the cup of tea Dr. Chen offered. They'd asked her to come to the station voluntarily, and she'd agreed immediately, relief and grief mixing in her expression.

"I heard about Dr. Harrington," she said quietly. "Is it true? Did she really...?"

"We're still building our case," Reeves said carefully. "But we found a letter from Professor Sterling about you. Dated January twentieth. Do you remember what happened around that time?"

Sarah's hands tightened on the cup. "He tried to get me removed from Dr. Harrington's research team. Said I wasn't qualified, that I'd gotten into Harvard through 'diversity initiatives' rather than merit." Her voice was steady, but anger flickered underneath. "Dr. Harrington fought for me. She told him my work was brilliant, that I'd published more papers than any other graduate student in the program. He said it didn't matter—I lacked the 'intellectual pedigree' for serious research."

Chen leaned forward. "How did Dr. Harrington react to that?"

"She was furious. I'd never seen her that angry." Sarah set down the tea. "She went to the dean, filed a formal complaint about Sterling's bias. But the dean said Sterling was a renowned professor, and his assessment of students was his prerogative. They suggested I might be happier in a different program."

"What did Dr. Harrington do?"

"She told me not to worry. Said Sterling had been doing this for decades, destroying careers of anyone he deemed unworthy. But she said..." Sarah's voice caught. "She said he wouldn't hurt anyone else. That she'd make sure of it."

Reeves felt the pieces clicking together. "When did she say that?"

"Late January, maybe the twenty-fifth? We were working late in the lab. She seemed different that night—resolved, almost calm. Like she'd made a difficult decision and felt at peace with it."

A week before Sterling's death. A week after trying legal channels and finding them closed.

"Did Professor Sterling continue targeting you after that conversation?"

"No. Actually, he..." Sarah frowned, remembering. "He called me into his office on February third. I thought he was going to tell me I was being expelled. But instead, he said he'd reconsidered, that perhaps he'd been too harsh. He asked me about my research, actually listened to my answers. It was strange—almost like he was trying to apologize without saying the words."

February third. Five days before Harrington deployed the poison. Five days before Sterling began dying.

"How did he seem?" Chen asked. "Physically, emotionally?"

"Tired. Maybe a bit nervous? He kept looking at his tea like he expected something wrong with it." Sarah's eyes widened. "Oh God, did he know? Was someone threatening him?"

"We don't think so," Reeves said gently. "Professor Sterling died of cardiac arrest. The timeline is just helping us understand what happened in his final weeks."

After Sarah left, promising to make herself available for further questions, the team sat in silence. They'd interviewed three other students—all with similar stories of Sterling's cruelty, all ultimately saved when Harrington intervened or Sterling mysteriously backed down.

"She was saving them," Ethan said finally. "All of them. Not just Sarah Kim."

"Or she was building a justification for murder." Chen's voice was sharp. "Let's not lose sight of what she actually did."

Walsh's phone buzzed. He glanced at it, then stood. "Harrington's here. They picked her up outside the hospital. She's asking for her lawyer."

—

Dr. Olivia Harrington sat in Interview Room Two, still wearing her surgical scrubs, her hair pulled back in a neat bun. She looked smaller than Reeves remembered, diminished somehow, as if the act of being arrested had reduced her.

But her eyes were sharp and alert as Reeves and Walsh entered.

"Dr. Harrington, I'm Detective Reeves. We met briefly—"

"I remember." Her voice was controlled, clinical. "I've requested my attorney. I assume you'll wait for her arrival before questioning me?"

"Of course. But I wanted you to know that we executed a search warrant on your office at Mass General this morning."

Something flickered across her face—fear, resignation, relief? It passed too quickly for Reeves to read.

"I see."

"We found some interesting items in your locked drawer. A book about historical poisons. Your handwritten research notes. A timeline of chemical synthesis. Your lab notebook documenting forty-seven late-night visits."

Harrington's hands, folded on the table, didn't move. "Then you should definitely wait for my attorney."

"We also found Professor Sterling's letter about Sarah Kim. The one where he tried to remove her from your research team."

Now her hands tightened, just slightly. "Sterling destroyed careers for sport. Sarah is brilliant, and he couldn't see past her accent and her immigrant parents. He was going to ruin her the same way he ruined dozens of others."

"So you stopped him."

"I'd like to wait for my attorney."

They sat in silence for a moment. Harrington met Reeves' eyes steadily, and he saw something unexpected there—not guilt or fear, but a kind of weary pride. She'd committed the perfect murder, and now she'd been caught, and some part of her seemed almost glad of it.

"Your attorney has been called," Walsh said. "She'll be here within the hour. Until then, you'll wait in holding."

Harrington nodded once, stood, and allowed herself to be led away without protest. Reeves watched her go, thinking about the meticulous notes, the careful documentation, the research journal recording every step of creating an undetectable poison.

She'd wanted someone to know. Maybe not to be caught, but to have her work recognized. The perfect crime, wasted if no one understood its perfection.

—

By late afternoon, they'd hit a wall. Harrington's attorney—a sharp woman named Patricia Cowan who specialized in medical malpractice defense—had arrived and shut down all questioning. The physical evidence was strong, but circumstantial. The notes proved premeditation, the lab visits proved opportunity, Sterling's letter proved motive. But without a confession, without Harrington admitting she'd actually deployed the poison, a clever defense attorney might argue it was all theoretical research, academic curiosity, nothing more.

"We need behavioral evidence," Chen said, studying the timeline they'd built. "Something that shows consciousness of guilt. The notes are damning, but we need proof she actually went through with it."

Reeves thought about the investigation, all the interviews and records and careful reconstruction. They'd talked to Harrington's colleagues, her students, hospital administration. They'd mapped her movements and analyzed her research.

But they hadn't talked to the one person who'd known Sterling best, who'd been closest to the investigation from the beginning.

Wait—they needed Victoria Sterling's perspective on Harrington's behavior after the murder.

He pulled out his phone and called the Sterling residence.

—

Victoria Sterling's Beacon Hill townhouse still wore mourning like expensive jewelry—black wreath on the door, subdued lighting, everything hushed and proper. The housekeeper led Reeves to the sitting room, where Victoria sat in a wing-backed chair with a cup of tea balanced on her knee.

"Detective Reeves." She set down the cup with perfect precision. "I heard there had been an arrest. Dr. Harrington?"

"Yes, ma'am. I'm sorry to disturb you again, but I have some questions about Dr. Harrington's behavior after your husband's death."

Victoria's expression didn't change, but something shifted in her posture—a kind of settling, as if she'd been waiting for this conversation. "Please, sit. I wondered if someone would ask."

Reeves took the offered chair. "You noticed something?"

"One notices many things in Beacon Hill society, Detective. Particularly when someone's behavior becomes irregular." Victoria smoothed her skirt, choosing words carefully. "Dr. Harrington attended Jonathan's funeral. She sat in the back, left immediately after the service, didn't attend the reception. That was... unusual. She'd been close to Jonathan during her years as his student, despite their later difficulties. One would expect her to pay proper respects."

"Could she have been busy? An emergency at the hospital?"

"Perhaps. But that wasn't the only occasion." Victoria's fingers traced the rim of her teacup. "Two weeks after the funeral, I encountered her quite by accident at the Museum of Fine Arts. I was attending a trustee meeting, and she was in the gallery. When she saw me, she—Detective, she looked terrified."

"Terrified?"

"Absolutely stricken. White as a sheet, hands shaking. She mumbled something about an appointment and practically fled. It was most uncharacteristic. Dr. Harrington is usually composed to the point of coolness."

Reeves made notes. "Did you speak with her at all? Before or after the funeral?"

"I tried to, actually. Called her office a week after Jonathan's death to thank her for the flowers she'd sent. The arrangement was quite thoughtful—white lilies, which were Jonathan's favorite, though few people knew that. But she didn't return my call. Her assistant said she was unavailable."

"And you found that strange?"

Victoria met his eyes directly. "Detective, in our circles, one does not ignore a widow's gratitude. It's simply not done, particularly not for someone as socially astute as Dr. Harrington. Her avoidance was conspicuous. I mentioned it to several friends, who said they'd also found her behavior odd in the weeks following Jonathan's death—withdrawn, distracted, almost haunted."

"Haunted?"

"As if she were carrying a terrible burden." Victoria paused, then continued carefully. "I did not think she killed my husband, Detective. The evidence seemed to show natural causes, and I had no reason to suspect otherwise. But I did think she was hiding something. Perhaps an affair with Jonathan, perhaps some academic scandal. I confess I was curious enough to have my attorney make discreet inquiries."

Reeves looked up sharply. "What did you find?"

"Nothing concrete. But my attorney noted that Dr. Harrington had begun accessing her office at unusual hours, that she'd consulted with several estates attorneys about—interestingly enough—how medical research is treated in criminal investigations. Whether theoretical work could be considered evidence of intent."

The pieces fell into place. Harrington, realizing her perfect murder had worked, had begun to panic. Not about being caught—the autopsy showed natural causes, after all—but about whether she'd left any traces. She'd consulted attorneys, avoided anyone connected to Sterling, and radiated guilt so obvious that even Victoria had noticed.

"When did she consult these attorneys?" Reeves asked.

"Late February, according to my attorney's sources. Just before she apparently moved some materials from her laboratory to her office." Victoria tilted her head. "Is this helpful, Detective?"

"Very helpful. Mrs. Sterling, would you be willing to testify to Dr. Harrington's avoidance and unusual behavior?"

"Of course. If it helps establish the truth about Jonathan's death." She paused, then added quietly, "Detective, I loved my husband, but I was not blind to his faults. If Dr. Harrington did this because of his cruelty to students... one does not condone murder, naturally. But one can perhaps understand the desperation."

Reeves thought about Sarah Kim, about the dozens of other students Sterling had destroyed or attempted to destroy, about a system that protected prestigious professors while sacrificing brilliant young researchers.

"Understanding isn't the same as excusing," he said.

"No. But it is necessary for justice, is it not? To understand why someone did something terrible?" Victoria stood, signaling the end of the interview. "I will testify to what I observed, Detective. Dr. Harrington's behavior after Jonathan's death was that of a woman consumed by guilt. Whatever she did, she could not hide that burden."

—

Back at the station, Reeves added Victoria's observations to their timeline. The pattern was clear: before Sterling's death, Harrington had been her usual controlled, professional self. After his death, she'd become withdrawn, paranoid, avoidant. She'd consulted attorneys about evidence and intent. She'd moved materials from the lab to her office, trying to control what could be discovered.

Classic consciousness of guilt.

"This helps," Walsh said, reviewing Reeves' notes. "Shows she knew she'd done something wrong, that she was trying to hide it."

Chen had been running final analyses on the chemical formulas from Harrington's notes. "These match perfectly," she said, turning her laptop to show comparison images. "The compound she designed would produce exactly the cellular damage we found in Sterling. The timeline she documented matches the delayed-release mechanism I theorized. This isn't hypothetical research, Marcus. This is a murder manual."

Ethan had been quiet, studying photographs of Harrington's office. "She kept flowers on her desk," he said suddenly. "Did anyone notice? Fresh white lilies in a vase. Same flowers she sent to Victoria after Sterling died."

"So?" Walsh frowned.

"So lilies mean death. They're funeral flowers." Ethan pulled up his photos. "But they also mean... I dunno, purity maybe? Innocence? She's keepin' reminders of what she did right there in her office, like she can't let it go."

"Guilt," Chen said. "She's living with what she did."

"Or pride," Reeves countered. "Proof she saved Sarah Kim and others from Sterling's cruelty. Justification."

The question hung in the air: which was it? Did Harrington regret the murder, or did she celebrate it?

Maybe both.

Reeves looked at the assembled evidence—the poison book, the detailed notes, the lab records, the chemical requisitions, the timeline, Sterling's letter about Sarah Kim, Victoria's testimony about Harrington's guilty behavior. They had means, motive, opportunity, premeditation, and consciousness of guilt.

They had everything except Harrington's own admission.

"We need one more thing," Reeves said. "We need to know if Sterling knew he was dying. Whether this was murder or... something else."

"What do you mean?" Walsh asked.

"What if Sterling was already terminal? What if Harrington knew he was dying and just accelerated it?" Reeves thought about Victoria's comment from the very first interview, weeks ago—something about Jonathan being unusually kind in his final days. "We need Sterling's complete medical records. If he had a terminal diagnosis, that changes the nature of the crime."

"From murder to what?" Chen challenged. "Mercy killing is still homicide."

"Yes. But the moral calculation shifts. And if we're going to prosecute this case, we need to understand exactly what Harrington did and why."

Walsh nodded slowly. "I'll request Sterling's medical records. Should have done it weeks ago, but we were focused on the murder method."

"One more day of investigation," Reeves said. "Then we have everything we need for the DA."

But even as he said it, he felt the complexity of the case weighing on him. Harrington had committed premeditated murder using brilliant medical knowledge to create an undetectable poison. She'd killed Sterling to stop him from destroying more careers, to save Sarah Kim and others like her.

She was a murderer. She was also, in her own twisted logic, a savior.

The perfect crime had been perfectly motivated. And that, Reeves thought, would make the resolution far more complicated than anyone anticipated.

His phone buzzed. Walsh had sent a text: _Sterling's doctor is sending complete medical file. Should have it by morning._

Tomorrow they'd have the final piece. Tomorrow they'd know whether Sterling's death was pure murder or something more morally ambiguous.

Tonight, Reeves went home and thought about Webb, his mentor, who'd died in what was ruled a suicide. He'd never found proof it was murder. Never got the closure he needed.

But he'd solved Sterling's case. He'd found the puncture mark, traced the poison, documented the preparation, identified the killer. He'd done everything right.

So why did it feel incomplete?

Because solving the crime wasn't the same as understanding it. And understanding it meant grappling with the question Harrington would eventually force them to answer:

When is a murder something other than evil?
