# Chapter 13: The Teacher

The interview room smelled of stale coffee and the faint citrus of industrial cleaner. Sara found that grimly appropriate.

Katarina Ek sat across from her, hands folded on the scratched table. She'd been in custody for fourteen hours now, and her initial calm had settled into something harder. Resignation, maybe. Or calculation.

"Tell me about Adversary," Sara said.

Katarina's fingers twitched. "I already told you. A username on the forums."

"You said they taught you. Walk me through how that worked."

Emil leaned against the wall behind Sara, tablet in hand. He'd been silent for most of the interrogation, taking notes, occasionally pulling up data. Sara knew he was listening for technical details she might miss.

"It wasn't formal teaching," Katarina said. "Not like a course. They posted tutorials. Methodology documents. Answered questions in the threads." She paused. "They were patient. Careful. Never rushed anyone through the concepts."

"Sounds like a teacher," Sara said.

Something flickered across Katarina's face. Recognition, maybe. "Yes. Like a teacher. They had this way of explaining things in layers—start with the intuition, then the mathematics, then the implementation. That's how you actually teach statistics, you know. Not just dumping formulas on people."

Sara made a note. Katarina was still a teacher at heart, even after three years scrubbing toilets. "How many people did they teach?"

"I don't know. The forums are anonymous. But their threads had hundreds of replies. Maybe dozens of students. Maybe hundreds."

Emil spoke for the first time in twenty minutes. "Did they charge for this?"

"No. Everything was free. Open access." Katarina looked at him directly. "They said the knowledge should be available to everyone, not just people who can afford university degrees."

"An ideologue," Emil said quietly.

"Or someone who understands what it's like to be locked out," Katarina said. Her voice had an edge now. "Do you know what it's like to have skills that are useless because you're not the right kind of person? To watch less qualified people get opportunities because they fit some algorithm's pattern?"

Sara thought of her father. The shipping companies had replaced experienced dockworkers with optimization software and contractors from temp agencies. Twenty-five years of expertise erased by a spreadsheet.

"Yes," she said. "I do."

Katarina blinked. For a moment, the teacher facade cracked, and Sara saw the desperation underneath. A forty-five-year-old woman trying to keep her daughter's future intact.

"They're not doing this for money," Katarina said finally. "Adversary, I mean. They're doing it because they believe the system needs to be exposed. They think if enough people learn to exploit it, the surveillance infrastructure will collapse under its own weight." She laughed, brittle and tired. "A kind of algorithmic anarchism."

Sara exchanged glances with Emil. He was frowning at his tablet.

"Did you ever meet them in person?" Sara asked.

"No. Never."

"Did they ever mention where they were located?"

"No. The whole point was anonymity. But—" Katarina hesitated. "They posted at odd hours. European timezone, I think. And their Swedish was perfect. Native speaker. Some of the technical terms they used were... local. University-level computer science education, probably Swedish system."

Emil was typing rapidly now.

"Anything else?" Sara pressed. "Writing style, personal details, anything they let slip?"

Katarina closed her eyes, thinking. "They used metaphors from the street. Not abstract computer science language. They'd explain adversarial attacks like evading surveillance cameras in a neighborhood. Machine learning like learning to blend in with patterns. It felt... urban. Like they grew up somewhere that wasn't the nice part of town."

Sara's pulse quickened. Swedish education. European timezone. Native speaker. Urban background. University-level computer science. And an ideological commitment to exposing surveillance systems.

"How sophisticated were they?" Emil asked. "Technically."

"I only understood about half of what they posted," Katarina admitted. "The basic tutorials were clear, but when they went deep into model architectures and optimization techniques... that was beyond me. They were training people to train models, but they were also doing much more advanced work themselves."

"Did they post examples of their own work?"

"Sometimes. Not the full code, but screenshots. Architecture diagrams. Results from attacks they'd developed." Katarina opened her eyes. "They weren't just teaching. They were actively developing new exploits. Pharmacy security systems, smart building access controls, transit scheduling algorithms... they'd document vulnerabilities and share the methodology."

Emil's frown deepened. "The pharmacy robberies."

"I don't know anything about robberies," Katarina said quickly. "I'm talking about the technical forums. What people did with the knowledge afterward..."

"Wasn't your responsibility?" Sara finished. "That's a comfortable line."

Katarina's jaw tightened. "I didn't make the world this way. I'm just surviving in it."

"By teaching other people to commit crimes."

"By teaching people to protect themselves from systems that exploit them." Katarina leaned forward. "Every smart building is harvesting data on its residents. Every workplace algorithm is learning your patterns. Every automated system is building a model of your behavior to predict and control you. Adversary taught people to turn that around. To be the ones doing the predicting instead of being predicted."

Sara wanted to argue, but she understood the appeal. Her entire investigation had revealed how much data exhaust people generated just by existing. Service workers, dockworkers, delivery drivers—all of them walking data generators in someone else's system.

"We'll need everything you have," Emil said. "Forum posts, private messages, any contact information."

"It's on my phone. You already have it."

Emil nodded. "We'll need you to walk us through the timeline. Every interaction with Adversary. Everything you learned from them."

Katarina studied him. "Why? You already have me. What does it matter who taught me?"

"Because they're still out there," Sara said. "Still teaching. Still developing exploits. And somewhere in Malmö, someone is using those techniques for more than apartment burglaries."

Chen Wei heard about the expanded investigation during her lunch break.

She was sitting in the port authority cafeteria, picking at a salad she couldn't taste, when Mattias from customs walked past. He paused by her table.

"Did you hear they arrested someone? That cleaning company manager, the one doing the Turning Torso burglaries."

Chen's fork stopped halfway to her mouth.

"They're saying it's connected to the port case," Mattias continued. "Some kind of pattern. Using service workers' access to train machine learning models. Economic Crime is coordinating with us now. Europol's even involved."

"That's good," Chen managed. Her voice sounded distant in her own ears. "Progress."

"Yeah. We've got more interviews scheduled. They're going through everyone who had container access during the smuggling period." Mattias grabbed a coffee from the dispenser. "You'll probably get called in again. They're being thorough."

After he left, Chen stared at her salad. The lettuce looked plastic under the fluorescent lights.

Economic Crime. Europol. Pattern analysis across cases.

Her phone felt heavy in her pocket. She'd powered it down this morning, like she did every day now. The secure phone—the one they'd given her, the one with the encrypted app—sat in a drawer at home, also powered down. She hadn't checked it in three days.

Cowardice, she knew. If they wanted to reach her, they would. And if they were angry about her silence...

She forced herself to eat three more bites of salad, then gave up. Around her, port workers laughed and complained about shift schedules and argued about football. Normal people with normal problems.

Chen was not normal. Chen was contaminated.

She thought about running. She had enough saved for a flight to Shanghai, enough connections to disappear into the city. But her brother was taking university entrance exams next month. Her parents were aging and needed her support. And the people who'd recruited her—who'd threatened her family if she didn't cooperate—they had longer reach than Swedish police.

Trapped. She was trapped between two sets of consequences, and both would destroy her.

Chen disposed of her lunch, nodded to colleagues, and walked back to her office. The container terminal stretched out beyond her window, endless rows of shipping containers stacked like a child's blocks. Automated cranes moved along their tracks with inhuman precision.

Somewhere in the building's server room, logs recorded every access, every container movement, every anomaly. Emil Bergström had already pulled those logs once. If they looked closer, if they brought in Europol's forensic accountants...

She opened her laptop and stared at the shipping manifests. Work was still work. The containers still needed to be tracked, scheduled, loaded. She could do her job. She could be professional.

Her hands were shaking.

Emil's forensics lab at midnight had the quality of a submarine: windowless, humming with electronics, isolated from the surface world. He'd sent Sara home three hours ago, but he couldn't leave yet.

Katarina's phone was a treasure. Three years of forum activity, private messages, saved tutorials, and model training logs. He'd imaged the drive and was now running it through every analysis tool he had.

The Adversary's posts dated back eighteen months. The earliest were simple: explanations of how recommendation algorithms worked, how to identify patterns in automated systems, basic adversarial perturbation techniques. Educational, almost innocent.

Then they got sophisticated.

Emil pulled up a thread from seven months ago titled "Exploiting Temporal Patterns in Security Systems." The methodology was elegant. Most security cameras operated on scheduled maintenance cycles—reboots, updates, blind periods. If you could predict those cycles, you could time your actions to the gaps.

But Adversary hadn't just explained the concept. They'd provided actual code for scraping public security system documentation, identifying common scheduling patterns, and building prediction models. The code was clean, well-commented, professional.

Emil recognized some of the techniques. They'd been used in the pharmacy robberies.

He opened another thread: "Service Worker Data as Training Corpus." This one was explicitly about how delivery drivers, cleaners, maintenance workers generated valuable behavioral data through their jobs. Adversary had outlined methods for collecting that data, cleaning it, and training predictive models.

Katarina had implemented a simplified version for her burglaries. But the original methodology was far more sophisticated than what she'd used.

Emil ran a writing style analysis on Adversary's posts. The software compared vocabulary, sentence structure, technical terminology, and idiomatic expressions. It flagged several markers:

- Native Swedish speaker, formal education
- Computer science background, likely graduate-level
- Preference for street metaphors and urban examples
- Code samples showed familiarity with modern ML frameworks
- Posting times clustered in evenings and weekends, Swedish timezone
- References to Malmö-specific infrastructure (the Öresund bridge congestion patterns, local transit schedules)

He cross-referenced the username across other forums. Adversary had accounts on six different dark web markets, all using the same PGP key. The key's metadata showed creation date: twenty-two months ago. Before that, nothing.

Either Adversary was new to this, or they'd created a clean identity specifically for this teaching project.

Emil pulled up the model architectures Adversary had posted. This was where things got interesting.

Every machine learning model left artifacts. The specific choices in architecture—layer types, activation functions, regularization techniques—reflected the builder's training and preferences. Like a signature.

Adversary's models had distinct patterns:
- Heavy use of attention mechanisms (modern, cutting-edge)
- Preference for ensemble methods over single models
- Careful regularization to prevent overfitting
- Emphasis on interpretability and explainability

This wasn't someone who'd learned ML from online tutorials. This was formal education, probably thesis-level work. And the techniques were recent—nothing older than two or three years.

Emil leaned back in his chair, thinking.

Swedish system. Computer science degree, likely within the last five years. Lives in or around Malmö. Urban background. Ideologically motivated. Expert in adversarial machine learning.

And somewhere in the city, they were still operating.

He pulled up the pharmacy robbery data. Six incidents over three months, all in different neighborhoods but following the same pattern. The timing was too precise to be random, the security exploits too sophisticated for an amateur.

If Adversary had taught Katarina, had they also committed the pharmacy robberies themselves? Or taught someone else?

Emil started building a profile document. Age range: mid-to-late twenties, possibly early thirties. Education: computer science degree from a Swedish university, likely Malmö or Lund. Employment: probably working in tech sector, enough salary to fund equipment and hosting. Location: Malmö, based on local references and posting times.

Ideological motivation: exposing surveillance capitalism, algorithmic transparency, democratizing exploit knowledge.

And a teacher's instinct. Someone who wanted others to understand, not just to profit alone.

Emil's phone buzzed. Sara, texting from home:

*Still there?*

He typed back: *Think I found something. They're local. University-educated. Can narrow the search.*

*Tomorrow. Go home. Sleep.*

*Soon.*

He wasn't going to sleep soon. He could feel it—the shape of the person emerging from the data. Not a name yet, but a profile. A pattern.

Somewhere in Malmö, someone had taught dozens of people how to exploit the surveillance infrastructure. Someone brilliant and angry and convinced they were doing the right thing.

Someone who was about to have a very bad week.

Emil saved his work, encrypted the files, and finally shut down his monitors. Four AM. He'd regret this in a few hours.

But for the first time in months, he felt something other than futility. They were hunting someone real now. Someone they could catch.

He just had to find them before they realized they were being hunted.
