# Chapter 13

The District Attorney's office occupied the seventh floor of the Suffolk County Courthouse, all polished wood and filtered light that made everything feel sanctified. Reeves sat across from Assistant District Attorney Katherine Brennan, watching her review the evidence folder for the third time. The puncture mark photographs lay spread across her desk like accusations.

"No," she said finally.

Reeves had known it was coming, but the word still hit like a verdict. "We have proof of injection."

"You have a microscopic mark that Dr. Chen believes is consistent with an injection site." Brennan pushed the photographs back toward him with one manicured finger. "Believes. Consistent with. Do you know what a defense attorney does with language like that?"

"The timing matches exactly—"

"The timing suggests correlation." Brennan stood, smoothing her skirt. She was forty-five and sharp as a scalpel, with a conviction rate Reeves grudgingly respected. "Detective, I appreciate the work you've done. I truly do. But a puncture mark that could be from anything, cellular damage that might indicate poison that we can't detect or identify, and circumstantial timing don't add up to probable cause for a search warrant."

Reeves felt the argument building in his chest, the same pressure that had driven him through two weeks of sleepless investigation. "Dr. Harrington visited Sterling three days before his death. She had the medical knowledge to create an undetectable poison. She had access to a sophisticated lab. She had motive—Sterling destroyed careers, and she was one of his former students."

"All of which makes her a suspect." Brennan returned to her desk, closing the folder with a soft thump. "Not enough for a warrant. You need more. Chemical purchase records. Lab access logs. Testimony from colleagues about suspicious behavior. Something concrete that links her to the actual creation of this theoretical poison."

"By the time we get that, she could destroy evidence."

"Then you'd better work fast." Brennan's expression softened slightly. "Look, I want to help you. But I won't burn a case by rushing a warrant that gets thrown out. Bring me something solid, and we'll talk again."

Outside the courthouse, March wind cut through Reeves' coat. He stood on the steps, watching traffic flow past on Cambridge Street, thinking about his mentor Webb. How many times had Webb stood on these same steps, holding evidence that proved murder but couldn't prove it legally? The system demanded certainty in an uncertain world.

His phone buzzed. Ethan: _Got conference room at station. Brought coffee._

—

The conference room smelled like burned coffee and old paint. Someone had covered one wall with a whiteboard, now filled with Ethan's neat handwriting. Reeves recognized the crime scene tech's careful documentation style—lists and timelines, connections drawn in different colors.

"So the DA said no?" Ethan handed him a cup, not quite meeting his eyes.

"She wants more evidence." Reeves studied the whiteboard. Ethan had already mapped out an investigation strategy: lab records, chemical suppliers, witness interviews, timeline reconstruction. "How long have you been here?"

"Got in around six." Ethan's voice carried that self-deprecating edge he used when he'd been working on instinct. "I got a feeling we're lookin' at this wrong. We keep thinkin' about what she did—the injection, the poison. But that stuff took time to plan. Months, maybe. There's gotta be a trail."

Dr. Chen appeared in the doorway, carrying her own coffee and a laptop. "I called in a favor at the state lab. They pulled all controlled substance requisitions for Mass General's cardiac research department for the past six months." She set the laptop on the table, screen already glowing with data. "If Dr. Harrington ordered anything unusual, it'll be in here."

Captain Walsh arrived last, looking like he hadn't slept. "Tell me you have something I can use."

"We have a strategy," Reeves said. "Dr. Harrington planned this murder for months. She researched, she prepared, she tested. Somewhere in her professional life, there's evidence of that preparation. We find it, we get our warrant."

Walsh dropped into a chair. "What do you need?"

"Access to Mass General's lab security logs. Her hospital keycard will show every time she accessed the research lab." Reeves moved to the whiteboard, picking up a marker. "We need her chemical requisition records, her computer access logs if we can get them, and we need to re-interview everyone who worked near her during that time frame."

"That's a lot of resources for a case that might go nowhere," Walsh said.

"It won't go nowhere." Reeves capped the marker, turning to face his captain. "This is the most carefully planned murder I've ever seen. Someone that meticulous doesn't just stop at the act itself. She documented, she took notes, she kept records. People like this—they want to prove they're smarter than everyone else. Wait—that's our way in."

Chen looked up from her laptop. "What do you mean?"

"She thinks she's safe. The poison degraded, the autopsy showed natural causes, her alibi checked out. She thinks she committed the perfect murder." Reeves felt the pieces aligning, the same clarity he'd experienced finding the puncture mark. "People who commit perfect crimes want credit for them. Eventually."

"You think she kept evidence?" Ethan's eyes widened. "Like a trophy?"

"More like notes. Research. A record of her work." Reeves added a new line to the whiteboard: _Evidence location?_ "Somewhere private where she could refer back to it, remind herself of her own brilliance. Her office, her home, maybe even the lab itself."

Walsh rubbed his face. "That's a lot of maybes, Marcus."

"We'll start with what we can access legally." Chen turned her laptop to show a spreadsheet of chemical requisitions. "These are all the controlled substances ordered through Harrington's lab code over the past six months. Most of it's standard cardiac research supplies—digoxin derivatives, various glycosides, testing compounds. But look at this."

She highlighted a series of entries from four months ago. "Three separate orders for rare glycoside variants, each from a different supplier. Small quantities, nothing that would trigger an audit individually. But together?" She pulled up another window. "These specific compounds could theoretically be modified to create a delayed-release cardiotoxin."

Reeves leaned over her shoulder. "Theoretically?"

"I'd need to run synthesis models, but yes. With the right expertise in cardiac pharmacology—which Dr. Harrington certainly has—these could be precursor compounds." Chen's fingers flew across the keyboard. "The interesting part is the timing. She ordered them over three separate months, different suppliers, different authorization codes. Someone trying to hide a pattern."

"Can we prove they were used for something other than legitimate research?" Walsh asked.

"Not without accessing her research logs and lab notebooks. Which we need a warrant for." Chen sat back, frustrated. "But it's suspicious. Most researchers order from consistent suppliers, batch their requisitions together for efficiency. This pattern is deliberately obscured."

Ethan had been studying his own notes. "What about lab access? If she was synthesizin' something off the books, she'd need privacy. Late nights, weekends, times when nobody else was around."

"Mass General's lab has keycard access." Reeves pulled out his phone. "We can request security logs as part of a routine investigation. They won't need a warrant for that—it's hospital property, not personal."

Walsh nodded slowly. "That I can help with. Hospital administration owes me favors. They won't want to look like they're obstructing a murder investigation."

"Even if it's one of their star doctors?" Ethan asked.

"Especially then. They'll want to cooperate publicly while protecting themselves legally." Walsh stood. "I'll make some calls. What else?"

"I want to talk to her colleagues," Reeves said. "People who worked near her during those months. Anyone who might have noticed unusual behavior, odd hours, strange questions. We're looking for character evidence—was she distracted, secretive, stressed?"

"That's not circumstantial," Chen warned. "Lots of doctors are stressed."

"But context matters. If she was working late nights at the lab, ordering unusual chemicals, and acting strangely, it builds a picture." Reeves capped the marker again. "We need enough for Brennan to reconsider. We need enough that a judge can't say no."

They divided responsibilities. Walsh would handle Mass General administration, requesting lab access logs and chemical requisition details. Chen would continue analyzing the compounds, building a theoretical synthesis pathway that matched the cellular damage. Ethan would review all the crime scene evidence again, looking for anything they'd missed that might point to premeditation. And Reeves would interview Harrington's colleagues and research associates.

"This could take weeks," Walsh warned. "And the whole time, she's out there. If she suspects we're closing in—"

"She won't," Reeves interrupted. "She thinks the case is dead. Natural causes, no evidence, investigation going cold. Why would she run when she's convinced she won?"

—

Three days later, Reeves sat in a coffee shop near Mass General, reviewing his fourth interview notes. Dr. Raymond Torres, a cardiac researcher who worked two labs down from Harrington, had been enthusiastically unhelpful.

"Olivia? Brilliant woman, absolutely brilliant. A bit intense, but that's not unusual in our field."

"Did you notice any changes in her behavior this past winter?"

"Changes? Well, she was working longer hours than usual. But we all do that when we're close to a breakthrough. She's been working on delayed-release mechanisms for cardiac medication—trying to solve the dosing problem for patients who can't maintain consistent drug levels."

Reeves had written that down carefully. Delayed-release mechanisms. "Did she discuss this research with you?"

"Not in detail. Olivia tends to keep her work close to the vest until she's ready to publish. Competitive field, you understand. Can't risk someone stealing your methodology."

The pattern had repeated through three other interviews. Harrington working late, focused on delayed-release mechanisms, keeping her research private. All perfectly normal for an academic researcher. All perfectly consistent with someone developing an undetectable murder weapon.

His phone buzzed with a text from Walsh: _Got the lab logs. You're going to want to see this._

—

The conference room had evolved into a war room. The whiteboard now covered three walls, filled with timelines, chemical formulas, interview summaries, and lab access patterns. Ethan had created a massive calendar, each date marked with Harrington's activities.

"Forty-seven late-night lab visits over three months," Walsh said, pointing to the clusters of red marks on Ethan's calendar. "All between midnight and five AM. All logged under her security code, no other personnel present."

Chen had added chemical notation beneath each cluster. "And look at the timing of the chemical requisitions. She orders compounds in week one, accesses the lab alone in week two. Orders different compounds in week three, more late-night access in week four. It's a pattern."

"A suspicious pattern," Reeves agreed. "But is it enough?"

"Depends what she was doing during those visits." Ethan had been cross-referencing hospital records. "Thing is, none of those late-night sessions produced any documented research. No logged experiments, no sample storage records, no data uploads to the hospital servers. Forty-seven visits with nothin' to show for them officially."

Walsh whistled low. "That's unusual."

"More than unusual. Hospital policy requires documentation of all research activity for liability and funding purposes." Chen pulled up the relevant regulations on her laptop. "Every experiment should generate a paper trail. The fact that hers didn't means either she was violating protocol, or she was deliberately hiding her work."

Reeves studied the timeline, feeling the case crystallize. "She spent three months developing the poison. Small batches, late-night synthesis when no one could observe, careful documentation nowhere that could be audited. Then she visited Sterling, injected him with a delayed-release compound that would take seventy-two hours to activate, and waited."

"Can we prove any of that?" Walsh asked the essential question.

"Not yet. But we're close." Reeves circled a date on the calendar—the night of Sterling's death. "She accessed the lab at two AM the day after his death. Why? The murder was done, Sterling was dead. What did she need from the lab?"

Ethan leaned forward. "Maybe she was cleanin' up? Destroyin' evidence?"

"Or retrieving something," Chen suggested. "If she kept notes, formulas, test results—she might have had them stored in the lab. Once Sterling died and it looked like natural causes, she'd want to move that evidence somewhere safer."

"Her office or home," Reeves said. "Somewhere she has complete control."

"Which brings us back to needing a warrant." Walsh's phone buzzed. He glanced at it, then showed Reeves the screen. A text from DA Brennan: _If you have lab logs showing unauthorized research, that might be enough. Call me._

—

By evening, they had assembled a revised evidence packet: forty-seven undocumented lab visits, chemical requisitions for compounds that could theoretically synthesize cardiotoxins, interviews describing obsessive behavior and secretive research, and Dr. Chen's analysis showing how the ordered chemicals could produce the cellular damage pattern found in Sterling.

"It's still circumstantial," Brennan said over speakerphone. "But it's substantial circumstantial evidence. The unauthorized lab activity is concerning enough that I can argue reasonable suspicion. Where do you want to search?"

"Her office at Mass General," Reeves said. "That's where she'd keep research notes, and it's hospital property—easier legal standing than searching her home."

"I'll have a warrant by tomorrow morning. But Detective?" Brennan's voice sharpened. "You get one shot at this. If you execute that warrant and come up empty, there's no second chance. Make absolutely sure you know what you're looking for."

After Walsh ended the call, the team sat in silence. Three weeks of investigation, hundreds of hours of work, everything riding on what they might find in Dr. Harrington's office.

"I got a feeling about this," Ethan said finally. "She's too smart to throw away her notes. Somewhere in that office, there's proof."

Chen nodded slowly. "The missing poison book from Sterling's collection. It was on historical toxins and medieval murder methods. Harrington checked it out from his personal library six months ago and never returned it. If we find that—"

"With her handwritten notes in the margins," Reeves finished. "That's our smoking gun. Well, smoking syringe."

Walsh stood, stretching his back. "Go home, all of you. Get sleep. Tomorrow we find out if we're right."

But Reeves stayed in the conference room after the others left, studying the whiteboard by the light of his laptop. Somewhere in Boston, Dr. Olivia Harrington was probably sleeping peacefully, convinced she'd committed the perfect crime. She'd spent three months building an undetectable murder weapon, deployed it with surgical precision, and watched as the medical establishment declared it natural causes.

She didn't know about the puncture mark. She didn't know they'd mapped her lab visits or tracked her chemical orders. She thought she was safe.

Tomorrow, Reeves thought, they'd find out if intelligence was enough to commit the perfect murder. Or if even genius left traces.

He thought of Webb, his mentor, who'd died under mysterious circumstances that were ruled suicide. No evidence, no proof, just Reeves' certainty that something was wrong. He'd failed Webb by not finding the truth in time.

He wouldn't fail Sterling.

Wait—he wouldn't fail justice. The truth wasn't the same thing as justice, but maybe in this case, they'd converge.

Reeves packed up his notes, turned off the lights, and headed into the cold March night. Tomorrow they'd search Harrington's office. Tomorrow they'd find the evidence they needed.

Or they'd lose their only chance to prove a perfect murder.
