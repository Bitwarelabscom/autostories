Chen Wei's fate uncertain and unsatisfying - bureaucratic limbo. Port case administrative closing feels like funeral paperwork. Snow falling on city running on algorithms - beautiful surface, complex exploitable infrastructure underneath. Chapter ends preparing for Thursday meeting - hope and dread balanced. Transitions theme: port case to pharmacy case, second week to third, investigation to potential breakthrough, Emil near quitting to continuing, Sara documenting to possibly catching."
