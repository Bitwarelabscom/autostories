# Chapter 19: Foundations

The headline in *Sydsvenskan* was more restrained than Sara had expected: **ALGORITHMIC CRIME RING DISMANTLED IN MALMÖ — Three Cases Show New Pattern of Technology-Enabled Theft**

The article ran two full pages, with diagrams explaining adversarial machine learning in terms a general audience might understand. The journalist, to her credit, had done her research. She'd interviewed cybersecurity experts, quoted Sara's official statement, and included a sidebar about the economic pressures driving service workers toward crime.

What the article didn't include, because Sara had refused to confirm it, were Chen Wei's name or location, the specific details of Yusuf's cooperation deal, or the fact that Katarina's daughter had been completely unaware of her mother's crimes. Some information stayed protected.

Sara read the article at her desk at 07:30, three weeks after Yusuf had signed his deal. Her coffee had gone cold while she parsed the technical explanations, checking for dangerous specifics that might teach would-be criminals too much.

Emil appeared in her doorway. "Have you seen Twitter?"

"I try not to."

"It's actually not terrible. #AlgorithmicCrime is trending. Mix of 'this is terrifying' and 'we need better regulation' and 'are police competent enough to handle this.'" He handed her his phone.

Sara scrolled through the feed. Policy wonks arguing about surveillance capitalism. Tech workers debating ML ethics. A surprising number of people asking whether their smart home devices were making them vulnerable. The discourse was chaotic but engaged.

"Public awareness is the first step toward political pressure," Sara said, handing the phone back. "Which becomes funding. Which becomes actual institutional change."

"You sound like you've been practicing that speech."

"I have a budget meeting with the Commissioner and City Council this afternoon." Sara pulled out her notes. "I've been practicing several speeches."

The Police Academy classroom smelled like whiteboard markers and institutional coffee. Twenty cadets sat in rows, most of them younger than Yusuf by five years, all of them visibly uncertain about learning from someone who'd been a criminal three weeks ago.

Yusuf stood at the front of the room, laptop connected to the projector. Emil sat to the side, officially supervising, actually just observing how his new colleague handled the hostile audience.

"Good morning," Yusuf said. His formal Swedish was impeccable, none of the Rosengård slang he'd use in his neighborhood. "I'm going to teach you how I robbed four pharmacies without anyone noticing until Detective Lindqvist figured out the pattern. Then we'll discuss how you could have caught me sooner."

That got their attention.

He pulled up a slide showing the Trustpilot review trigger mechanism. "First principle: every automated system makes decisions based on patterns. If you understand the pattern recognition logic, you can craft inputs that trigger specific responses. In this case, negative reviews triggered security system reboots. Predictable timing, exploitable delay."

A cadet raised her hand. "But you had to know the specific security system model and the review platform integration."

"Correct," Yusuf said. "Which means reconnaissance is step one. I spent three weeks mapping the target pharmacies. Watched employee behavior, documented system responses, built a model of their security protocols." He advanced to the next slide. "This is the surveillance footage from the first robbery. Notice the timestamp. Notice the camera angle. Now tell me what I did wrong."

The cadets leaned forward, engaged despite themselves. Emil recognized the teaching technique—not explaining what the expert knew, but challenging the students to figure it out themselves.

"You didn't disable the backup logs," a cadet in the back row said. "The security system rebooted but the transaction records stayed intact."

"Exactly." Yusuf pulled up the pharmacy's transaction database. "I got away with physical products, but I left a perfect digital record. Detective Bergström used these logs to establish the pattern across all four robberies." He glanced at Emil. "Want to explain how?"

Emil stood, joining Yusuf at the front. "I wrote a script to scan pharmacy security logs across Malmö for the specific timing pattern—review posted, system reboot, physical entry, reboot completion. Once I knew what to look for, I found all four incidents in about twenty minutes."

The transition was smooth, practiced. They'd spent two hours yesterday afternoon rehearsing this exact handoff, figuring out how to model the adversarial-to-defensive mindset shift.

"The key insight," Emil continued, "is that algorithmic crime leaves algorithmic evidence. You just need to know what pattern to search for. Which is why you need to think like criminals think." He gestured to Yusuf. "Which is why he's here."

The cadets were taking notes now, barriers lowering. Yusuf caught Emil's eye, a quick acknowledgment. This was working.

After the session, in the hallway, a cadet approached them. Young, serious, nervous. "Mr. Hassan, can I ask—why are you helping us? You could have run. Could have disappeared."

Yusuf considered the question. "Because running doesn't change anything. I'd have stayed invisible, stayed criminal, and someone else would figure out the same exploits I did. This way, maybe I make it harder for the next person. Maybe I prove that someone from Rosengård can contribute without being either a criminal or a victim."

The cadet nodded slowly. "That's actually... principled."

"Don't sound so surprised." Yusuf's smile was dry. "We have principles in the neighborhood. They're just not always the same as yours."

Sara drove north on the E4 through spring-gray landscape, patches of snow still clinging to shadowed areas. She'd taken the afternoon off after her budget meeting—successful, the task force approved with actual funding—and driven to the cemetery in Barsebäck where her father was buried.

She hadn't visited in two years. Hadn't known what to say to a gravestone about how his daughter spent her days chasing the consequences of the automation that had killed him.

Erik Lindqvist's grave was simple. Granite stone, dates, no religious symbols. Her mother had chosen well—he'd never been much for sentiment.

Sara stood there for a long time, hands in her coat pockets, watching the wind move through the grass between headstones.

"I'm leading a specialized unit now," she said finally, feeling foolish talking to carved stone. "Algorithmic Crime Task Force. Terrible name, necessary work. They gave me a budget for five full-time investigators, two analysts, and access to external consultants. Real resources. The Commissioner actually used the word 'priority.'"

A crow landed on a nearby stone, watched her with intelligent indifference.

"You'd probably think I'm part of the problem. Working for the system that automated you out of relevance." Sara's voice was steady, conversational. "I thought that too, for a long time. Felt like I was betraying you every time I used ML analysis tools. Every time I relied on automated systems to do what human investigators used to do."

The crow flew away. The cemetery was very quiet.

"But I met people in these cases—Chen Wei, Katarina Ek, Yusuf Hassan. All of them were displaced or exploited by algorithmic systems. All of them fought back the only way they knew how, by becoming criminals. And I realized..." Sara paused, organizing her thoughts. "I realized you wouldn't want me to fight the automation. You'd want me to fight for the people the automation displaces. To make sure they have options besides crime or despair."

She crouched down, brushed dead leaves off the stone.

"Chen is safe now. In witness protection, new identity, legitimate work. Katarina is in prison, but her daughter got a scholarship. Yusuf is teaching police cadets. They all faced consequences, but they also got dignity. Got chances to be more than their worst choices."

The wind picked up, cold but carrying the faint promise of actual spring.

"I can't bring back the old jobs. Can't make human labor essential again in a world that's learned to optimize it away. But I can make sure the displaced people have somewhere to go besides the shadows." Sara stood, wiped her hands on her jeans. "I think that's what you'd want. For me to care about the dockworkers, not the docks."

She stayed another few minutes, not talking, just being present with the memory of a man who'd been made obsolete and never recovered.

Then she walked back to her car and drove south to Malmö, where the work was waiting.

---

The task force's new office was being prepared in a renovated section of the police headquarters—three rooms with proper workstations, server access, whiteboard walls, and windows that actually opened. Sara stood in the empty space with Emil, both of them holding coffee and imagining what it would look like in two weeks when the team assembled.

"I interviewed the two analyst candidates," Emil said. "Anna Svensson from Göteborg cybercrime is excellent. Strong ML background, five years of experience, and she actually wants to work algorithmic crime. Not just using it as a stepping stone."

"And the second?"

"Marcus Lindholm. Less technical depth but better at translating complex concepts. Journalism background before he switched to digital forensics. He could handle the external communications aspect—press, reports, training materials."

Sara made notes on her tablet. "Send me their files. We need the team in place by May first."

They walked through the space, planning desk layouts, equipment needs, secure file storage. The mundane logistics of building something new.

"Yusuf's first session went better than expected," Emil said. "The cadets were skeptical at first, but by the end they were actually engaging. He's a natural teacher when he's not being a criminal."

"His deal requires four hours a week minimum. Think he'll do more?"

"I think he's starved for legitimate purpose. Yeah, he'll do more." Emil paused by the window, looking out at Malmö's skyline. "You know the irony? We're building this whole institutional response, training the next generation, trying to stay ahead of algorithmic crime. But in six months, someone will find a new exploit we never imagined."

"Probably," Sara agreed. "Does that mean we shouldn't try?"

"No. It means we should be realistic about what 'winning' looks like." Emil turned from the window. "We won't eliminate algorithmic crime. We'll just make it incrementally harder. Raise the skill floor. Catch some criminals, deter others, provide alternatives for the ones who might be persuaded. It's Sisyphean work."

"Good thing I'm stubborn," Sara said.

They stood in the empty office space that would soon house the unit, both of them thinking about the cases behind them and the cases ahead. About Chen Wei in her safe house, learning to trust again. About Katarina in prison, reading books in the library and writing letters to Emma. About Yusuf in the classroom, turning his criminal expertise into defensive knowledge.

"The work never ends," Emil said quietly.

"No," Sara agreed. "But maybe that's okay. Maybe it's enough to just keep working."

That evening, Sara received a video call from an unknown number, routed through multiple encryption layers. She almost declined, then recognized the protocol Chen Wei's witness protection handler had described.

Chen's face appeared on screen, pixelated from the bandwidth limits of whatever secure relay they were using. Behind her, Sara could see pine trees through a window. Northern Sweden, as promised.

"Detective Lindqvist," Chen said, her formal Swedish pronunciation as precise as ever. "I wanted to thank you. For following through on your promises. For protecting my family. For giving me a chance."

Sara felt suddenly tired of being thanked for doing her job. "How are you adjusting?"

"It's quiet. Very quiet after Malmö. But I have work—logistics coordination for a forestry products company. Legitimate work. I can sleep now without checking the locks three times."

"Your testimony helped Europol make fourteen arrests across the smuggling network. Including the operational lead in Hamburg. You did that."

Chen's expression was complicated, relief mixed with residual fear mixed with something like pride. "I was so afraid for so long. Afraid of the criminals, afraid of police, afraid of being deported, afraid of staying. Now I'm just... here. Safe. Building something legitimate."

"You earned it," Sara said. "That took courage."

"It took you giving me a reason to be courageous." Chen glanced off-screen, checking something. "I should go. My handler says to keep calls short. But I wanted you to know—the system worked. You worked. Thank you."

The connection ended. Sara sat in her apartment, looking at the blank screen, thinking about trust and institutions and the gamble Chen had taken on Swedish justice.

The system had worked. This time. For this person. It wasn't a guarantee, wasn't a pattern she could rely on. But it was something.

Her phone buzzed. Emil: *Drinks tomorrow to celebrate the task force approval? You're buying since you got the promotion.*

Sara smiled, texted back: *I got the RESPONSIBILITY. You're buying.*

*That's not how promotions work.*

*That's exactly how they work. See you at 18:00.*

She set down her phone and looked around her small apartment. In two weeks she'd be leading a team. In six months they'd have closed cases, built institutional knowledge, maybe even prevented some crimes. In a year, they'd be chasing the next generation of algorithmic criminals.

The work was Sisyphean. The victories were incremental. The criminals would keep innovating.

But Sara Lindqvist would keep working. Keep catching patterns. Keep offering displaced people alternatives to crime. Keep building something that might, might just make the system slightly more just.

It wasn't winning. It was just refusing to lose completely.

And sometimes, that was enough.
