# Chapter 11

Ethan Cross couldn't sleep.

Two nights since Walsh closed the Sterling case, and he'd spent both of them staring at his ceiling, trying to convince himself to let it go. Move on. It was done. Over. Just another case that got away, and there'd be plenty more over the years. You couldn't solve them all.

Except he kept seeing that study. Sterling's body in the chair. The books. The desk. That lamp.

That goddamn lamp.

At three in the morning, Ethan gave up on sleep, pulled on a hoodie, and padded to his kitchen. His apartment in Allston was small—studio with a galley kitchen and a bathroom barely big enough to turn around in—but it was his. The kind of place a crime scene tech could afford on Boston PD salary.

He made coffee, strong and black, and booted up his laptop. He'd downloaded copies of all his Sterling crime scene photos before the case got filed away. Technically against policy, but Ethan had learned early on that sometimes you needed to review a scene long after the official investigation ended. Sometimes the answer only revealed itself when you stopped looking so hard.

The photos loaded one by one. Wide-angle establishing shots. Close-ups of the body. Detail shots of the desk, the shelves, the floor. Ethan had taken maybe two hundred photos that first day, systematically documenting everything before they moved anything.

He started at the beginning, going through each image slowly, looking for—what? He didn't know. Just something. Anything. The thing that had been buggin' him from the start.

*The scene feels staged.*

That's what he'd told Reeves, and Reeves had latched onto it at the end, but by then it was too late. Walsh had already closed the case. And what did Ethan have to back up his feeling? Nothing. Just instinct. Just the sense that something was wrong that he couldn't articulate.

He clicked through the photos methodically. Sterling slumped in his chair, head tilted back, mouth slightly open. Peaceful, like he'd fallen asleep. No signs of struggle. No disorder. Everything in its place.

Too much in its place.

Ethan paused on a wide shot showing the full study. The desk positioned just so. Papers neatly stacked. Books aligned on shelves. Even the reading glasses folded on the side table looked deliberate, like someone had arranged them.

But people didn't die neatly. Ethan had worked enough death scenes to know that. Heart attacks especially—people clutched their chests, knocked things over, fell awkwardly. There was usually some evidence of distress, of the body's final struggle.

Not here. Here everything looked composed. Intentional.

Staged.

He moved to the next photo, then the next. His eyes kept returning to the desk lamp. Brass and green glass, probably from the twenties, the kind of antique that fit the brownstone's aesthetic. In every photo where it was visible, it was on, glowing softly even though the afternoon light from the window should have been plenty.

Wait.

Ethan pulled up the incident report, checking the time. Body discovered at 3:47 PM. Call logged at 3:51 PM. He and Reeves arrived at 4:03 PM. March, so sunset was around six. The study's south-facing windows would have been flooding the room with light at that hour.

So why was the lamp on?

He zoomed in on the lamp in one of the detail shots. It was angled toward the chair where Sterling had died, tilted downward, focused. Not the position you'd use for reading at the desk. You'd angle it toward the desktop, toward where you were working.

This was angled at the chair. At where Sterling's head would have been.

Providing direct, focused illumination.

For what?

Ethan's heart started beating faster. He pulled up more photos, tracking the lamp's position from different angles. Same configuration in each one. Deliberate. Precise. Angled to illuminate one specific spot.

The left side of Sterling's head.

*Oh.*

Ethan sat back, coffee forgotten. If you wanted to inject someone with something, you'd need good light. You'd need to see clearly, especially if you were going for a spot that would be hard to find. Like a vein in the scalp, hidden in the hairline where it wouldn't be immediately visible.

You'd position a lamp exactly like this one was positioned.

But that was crazy, right? That was making a huge assumption based on a lamp being on during the daytime. Lots of people left lamps on. Lots of people had weird lighting habits. It didn't mean—

Except it did mean something. It had to. Because that feeling Ethan had been carrying around for two weeks, that sense of wrongness, it was finally crystalizing into something concrete.

He opened a new photo—one of the close-ups of Sterling's head and shoulders. The detail was good; Ethan always shot high-resolution, knowing you never knew what might matter later. He zoomed in, studying Sterling's hairline on the left side. The lamp side.

There. Was that—?

No, just a shadow. Or maybe a trick of the light. He couldn't tell at this resolution.

But if someone had injected Sterling three days before his death, there'd be a mark. Microscopic, probably, especially after three days of healing. But it would be there. Hidden in the hairline where the lamp's light would help you find it and the shadows would help you hide it afterward.

Ethan pulled out his phone, started to call Reeves, then stopped. It was three-thirty in the morning. And more importantly, what would he say? *Hey, I think the lamp position proves murder?* Walsh had already told them the case was closed. Reeves was supposed to be moving on, working real cases with real evidence.

Not chasing shadows based on a crime scene tech's gut feeling about lighting.

But this wasn't just a gut feeling anymore. This was observable, documentable. The lamp was on when it shouldn't have been. It was angled wrong for reading. It was positioned to illuminate a specific spot on Sterling's body.

That wasn't random. That was purposeful.

Ethan opened his photo editing software, pulling up the close-up of Sterling's head again. He adjusted the contrast, increased the sharpness, enhanced the shadows. Professional photographers would probably consider what he was doing heresy, manipulating the image like this, but he wasn't trying to create art. He was trying to find truth.

The image sharpened. Sterling's face became clearer, the hairline more defined. Ethan zoomed in on the left temple area, where the lamp had been focused.

And there—barely visible, just a tiny irregularity in the skin—was that something?

He enhanced it further, holding his breath. The irregularity became slightly more distinct. A small mark, maybe two millimeters across, partially obscured by hair. Could be anything. A mole. A freckle. An age spot.

Or a partially healed injection site.

Ethan sat back, hands shaking slightly. He needed better equipment. The forensic lab had imaging software that could detect things invisible to the naked eye. UV photography that showed skin damage. Microscopic analysis that could prove whether that mark was a puncture wound.

But the lab was closed until morning. And even if he went in early, pulled the original uncompressed images from the server, ran every analysis he could think of—what then? The case was closed. Walsh had made that clear. And Ethan didn't have the authority to reopen it on his own.

But Reeves did.

Ethan looked at his phone again. Four AM now. Reeves was probably awake anyway, couldn't sleep either, churning over the same frustrations. And if Ethan was right about this—if that mark really was an injection site—then they had physical evidence. The one thing Walsh said they needed. The one thing that could turn circumstantial theory into prosecutable fact.

He picked up the phone, hesitated one more time, then dialed.

Reeves answered on the second ring, voice rough but alert. "Ethan? What's wrong?"

"The lamp," Ethan said. "In Sterling's study. It was positioned wrong."

Silence on the other end. Then: "What do you mean wrong?"

"I mean it was on when it didn't need to be, and it was angled at Sterling's head instead of the desk, and I think—" He took a breath, steadied himself. "I think someone positioned it to illuminate an injection site. In the hairline. Left temple area. And I think there's a mark there, in the photos. I can't be sure without better equipment, but there's somethin', Marcus. I'm not just bein' paranoid this time. There's actually somethin'."

Another pause, longer this time. Ethan could hear Reeves breathing, could almost hear him thinking, weighing, deciding whether to hope again or to protect himself from another disappointment.

"You're at home?" Reeves finally asked.

"Yeah."

"Send me the images. The ones you've enhanced. I'll meet you at the lab in an hour." A pause. "And Ethan? If you're right about this—if there's really a puncture mark that Chen missed—"

"I know," Ethan said. "It changes everything."

"It proves murder."

"Yeah."

He could hear Reeves moving around, getting dressed probably, already shifting back into detective mode. "One hour. Bring everything you've got. And Ethan?"

"Yeah?"

"Your instinct about the scene being staged—I should have listened to that from the beginning. I should have trusted it."

"You're trustin' it now," Ethan said. "That's what matters."

After they hung up, Ethan started compiling the images, organizing them by angle and detail level, preparing the presentation he'd give to Reeves and hopefully to Dr. Chen and maybe, if they were really lucky, to Captain Walsh.

The lamp that shouldn't have been on.

The angle that was wrong for reading.

The shadow patterns that revealed more than they concealed.

And that tiny mark in Sterling's hairline that could be nothing or could be everything.

Ethan had spent his whole career being told his instincts didn't matter, that feelings weren't evidence, that he needed to trust science and logic over intuition. But science was observation, and logic was pattern recognition, and intuition was just the brain processing information faster than the conscious mind could articulate.

And his brain had been screaming since day one that this scene was wrong.

Finally, finally, he had something concrete to back that up.

He saved the files, backed them up to cloud storage and a thumb drive, then headed for the shower. By the time he got to the lab, Reeves would be there, and Dr. Chen would hopefully be on her way, and they'd have one shot at this.

One shot to prove that the perfect crime had one imperfect detail.

One shot to turn a closed case into an active investigation.

One shot to prove that Ethan Cross's instincts—the gut feelings everyone dismissed, the hunches that couldn't be quantified—were worth something after all.

The lamp had been positioned to illuminate a murder.

And now, two weeks later, that same positioning was going to illuminate the truth.

Ethan smiled grimly as he grabbed his keys. Harrington had been brilliant, meticulous, nearly perfect. But she'd made one mistake, so small she probably didn't even know it was a mistake.

She'd left the lamp on.

And Ethan Cross had finally figured out why.

---

By the time Ethan reached the forensic lab, Reeves was already there, pacing in the hallway with two cups of coffee from the 24-hour place on Cambridge Street. He handed one to Ethan without a word, and they headed inside.

The lab was ghostly quiet at five in the morning, just the hum of refrigeration units and the occasional beep from equipment running overnight analyses. Ethan led the way to his workstation, booting up the professional imaging software and pulling up the crime scene photos from the server.

"Walk me through it," Reeves said, pulling a chair close.

Ethan opened the wide-angle shot first. "Okay, so this is what I kept comin' back to. The lamp is on, right? But look at the windows. Full daylight. March afternoon, south-facing windows, plenty of natural light."

"People forget to turn off lamps."

"Yeah, but look at the angle." Ethan zoomed in on the lamp. "It's not positioned for desk work. It's focused on the chair. On where Sterling's head was."

Reeves leaned closer, studying the screen. "Providing direct illumination."

"Exactly. Like someone needed to see somethin' specific. Somethin' small. Somethin' that required precision." Ethan pulled up the next series of photos, showing the lamp from different angles. "Same position in every shot. This wasn't accidental. This was deliberate."

"For an injection," Reeves said quietly.

"That's my theory. And if I'm right—" Ethan opened the close-up of Sterling's head, the one he'd enhanced at home. "There should be a mark. Right about—here."

He zoomed in on the left temple area, where the hairline met skin. The enhanced image showed the tiny irregularity, more visible now in the lab's professional display.

Reeves stared at it for a long moment. "That could be anything."

"Could be. Or it could be a partially healed puncture wound from an injection made three days before death." Ethan pulled up the UV imaging software. "I want to run this through every filter we've got. UV, infrared, spectral analysis. If it's a puncture wound, the skin damage will show up differently than natural marks."

"You need Chen for that," Reeves said. "She'd have to re-examine the body."

"Yeah." Ethan glanced at him. "You think she will? Case is closed, Marcus. Walsh made it pretty clear we're done."

"Walsh said we needed physical evidence. If this is physical evidence—" Reeves pulled out his phone. "I'm calling Chen. If anyone can tell us whether that's a puncture mark, it's her."

While Reeves made the call, Ethan continued working with the images, running them through different analytical filters. Each one revealed the mark a little more clearly, a small circular irregularity that was too regular to be natural, too positioned to be coincidental.

Right where someone would inject if they wanted to hide the mark in the hairline.

Right where the lamp had been positioned to provide perfect illumination.

Right where Ethan's instincts had been telling him to look for two solid weeks.

Reeves ended his call. "Chen's on her way. She sounded skeptical but curious. She'll re-examine the body, look for the mark with proper equipment."

"And if she finds it?"

"Then we reopen the case," Reeves said. "And we prove that Olivia Harrington committed murder."

Ethan nodded, turning back to his screen. The mark was there, tiny and easy to miss, but there. He could feel it in his bones, the same way he'd felt from the beginning that this scene was staged.

The lamp had revealed Harrington's crime.

And now it was going to reveal her guilt.

All because Ethan Cross had trusted his instincts enough to keep looking, even when everyone else had stopped.

Even when the case was closed.

Even when it seemed impossible.

Sometimes, Ethan thought, the truth was hiding in plain sight.

You just needed the right angle of light to see it.
