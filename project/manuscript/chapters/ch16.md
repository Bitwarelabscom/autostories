# Chapter 16

The medical file arrived as a thick PDF at 8:47 AM, sent from Dr. Arnold Petersen, Sterling's personal physician for twenty-three years. Reeves opened it on his laptop in the conference room, Chen looking over his shoulder, Walsh and Ethan arriving with coffee.

"Routine physical from last June," Reeves said, scrolling through the standard tests and results. "Blood pressure slightly elevated, cholesterol managed with medication, otherwise healthy for seventy-one years old. Then October..." He stopped.

Chen leaned closer to the screen. "Oh no."

The CT scan results filled half a page with clinical language that tried to soften devastating news. Mass in pancreatic head. Irregular borders. Involvement of superior mesenteric artery. Suspicious nodules in liver. Recommended immediate biopsy and oncology consult.

Reeves scrolled to the next document. Biopsy results, dated October 18.

_Adenocarcinoma of pancreatic head, poorly differentiated. Stage IV with hepatic metastases. Prognosis: 3-6 months with palliative care, possibly 8-10 months with aggressive chemotherapy. Patient has declined treatment, requesting comfort care only._

"Sterling was dying," Walsh said quietly.

They sat in silence, the implications spreading like ripples. Professor Jonathan Sterling, brilliant and cruel, had spent his final months knowing death was coming. And he'd told no one—not Victoria, not his colleagues, not his students.

"When was the diagnosis?" Ethan asked.

"October eighteenth." Reeves checked the timeline they'd built on the whiteboard. "Four months before his death. Four months before Harrington killed him."

"Wait—" Chen pulled up Harrington's notes on her own laptop. "Look at her timeline. She started researching poison methods in November, began synthesis in December. If Sterling got his diagnosis in October..."

"She could have been planning a mercy killing," Walsh finished. "If she knew he was terminal, if she knew he was in pain—"

"That would change everything," Reeves said. But even as he said it, something felt wrong. He scrolled through the medical file, looking for something he couldn't quite name.

Chen was already cross-referencing the records with their evidence. "Sterling declined treatment. He chose palliative care only. But there are no prescriptions for serious pain management here. No morphine, no fentanyl patches. Just moderate anti-nausea medication and low-dose pain relievers."

"Maybe he wasn't in pain yet?" Ethan suggested.

"Stage IV pancreatic cancer?" Chen shook her head. "He would have been experiencing significant discomfort by February. But look—" She pointed to a note from Dr. Petersen dated February 1, one week before Sterling's death. _Patient reports manageable pain levels, good appetite maintained, mental state positive. Discussing legacy planning and personal affairs. Appears at peace with diagnosis._

At peace. One week before Harrington injected him with poison.

Reeves felt the pieces shifting, the narrative he'd been building changing shape. "Victoria said Sterling was kind in his final weeks. Unusually kind. We thought it was strange, maybe guilt."

"He was dying," Walsh said. "Making amends before the end. That explains the conversation with Sarah Kim—why he called her in, why he seemed apologetic. He was trying to fix what he'd broken."

"But Harrington didn't know that." Chen pulled up the notes from Harrington's office. "Look at her research. All her motivation is about stopping Sterling from destroying more careers, preventing future harm. There's nothing here about mercy killing, nothing about relieving suffering. She thought he'd continue being cruel for years to come."

Ethan had moved to the whiteboard, staring at the timeline. "So she killed a dyin' man who was tryin' to make peace. She thought she was stoppin' a monster, but he was already... changin'."

The irony hit Reeves like a physical weight. Harrington had committed the perfect murder to save Sarah Kim and future students from Sterling's cruelty. But Sterling, facing death, had already begun trying to repair the damage he'd done. In another few months, he would have died naturally, possibly having reconciled with at least some of his victims.

Harrington had stolen that from him. From all of them.

"Unless she did know," Walsh said. "What if Sterling told her? What if she visited him on February eighth specifically because she knew he was dying, wanted to... accelerate it?"

"Then why would her notes focus entirely on preventing future harm?" Chen challenged. "Why document it as stopping a predator if she knew he was already dying?"

Reeves scrolled through the medical file again, looking for any indication that Sterling had shared his diagnosis. Patient communications, consultation records, any mention of Dr. Harrington's name.

There—a note from Dr. Petersen dated January 15:

_Patient adamant that diagnosis remain confidential. Has not informed wife or colleagues. States he wants his legacy to be his work, not his death. Confirmed patient has valid will and advance directives in place. Respecting patient privacy per his explicit wishes._

"He told no one," Reeves said. "Sterling wanted his death to look like it came suddenly. He didn't want pity or deathbed reconciliations. He was trying to fix things quietly, on his own terms."

"Pride," Chen said. "Even dying, he couldn't admit vulnerability."

But Reeves was remembering the crime scene, the study where Sterling had been found. The papers on the desk had included a draft letter—they'd photographed it but dismissed it as routine correspondence. He pulled up Ethan's crime scene photos, scanning through until he found it.

There. A handwritten letter on Sterling's personal stationery, dated February 7—the day before Harrington's visit:

_Dear Dr. Harrington,_

_I wanted to respond to your concerns regarding Ms. Sarah Kim. Upon reflection, I believe I may have been unduly harsh in my assessment. I would like to discuss reinstating my support for her research position. Would you be available to meet on the eighth?_

_I have also been considering the broader impact of my evaluations over the years. Perhaps we might discuss this as well._

_Sincerely,_
_Professor Jonathan Sterling_

"He invited her," Reeves said slowly, showing the letter to the others. "Sterling reached out to Harrington to apologize, to fix what he'd done to Sarah Kim. That's why she visited him on February eighth. She thought she was meeting him to argue for Sarah's position. She had no idea he was going to concede."

Ethan read the letter, his expression pained. "She came to save Sarah. He was gonna tell her Sarah was safe. Instead, she killed him."

"Did she know about the diagnosis or not?" Walsh demanded. "That's the crucial question."

Reeves thought it through, examining the evidence from every angle. Harrington's notes showed months of planning, all focused on stopping Sterling from hurting more students. Her timeline showed poison development starting in November, before Sterling sent his letter. Her motivation was prevention, not mercy.

But she'd deployed the poison on February eighth, after Sterling invited her to discuss changing his mind about Sarah.

"She didn't know he was dying," Reeves said with certainty. "If she'd known, her entire justification changes. She wouldn't need to kill him to save future students—he'd be dead within months anyway. The diagnosis would have made the murder unnecessary."

"Unless she wanted him to die sooner," Chen pointed out. "Before he could do more damage."

"But he was already trying to fix the damage." Reeves tapped the letter on his screen. "This meeting on the eighth—Sterling was going to tell Harrington that Sarah was safe, that he'd reconsidered. Maybe he was going to explain why, maybe even tell her about the diagnosis. We'll never know, because Harrington injected him with poison before he could speak."

The tragedy of it settled over the room like dust. Sterling, facing death, had reached out to make amends. Harrington, convinced she was saving Sarah, had killed him before he could change. Two people who might have found understanding instead became killer and victim.

"So it's not mercy killing," Walsh said. "It's just murder."

"It's murder based on incomplete information," Chen corrected. "Harrington thought she was stopping a predator. She didn't know he was dying, didn't know he was changing. She acted on what she knew about Sterling's past, not his present."

Ethan had pulled up another photo—the one of Sterling's body in the study. "Look at his desk. Those papers we thought were random notes? I'm seein' them different now. That's legacy planning. He was organizin' his affairs, writin' letters, tryin' to make things right before he died."

Reeves examined the photo with fresh eyes. The stack of papers included what looked like additional letters—probably to other students Sterling had wronged over the years. The man had been trying to clear his conscience, repair what he could, die with less burden.

Harrington had seen none of that. She'd seen the same cruel professor who'd tried to destroy Sarah Kim's career. She'd come prepared to argue, or perhaps to deploy the poison if arguing failed. She'd never given Sterling the chance to explain that he'd changed his mind.

Wait—but that assumed Harrington went in planning to kill him that day. What if the injection was spontaneous? What if she'd brought the poison just in case, and something Sterling said triggered her to use it?

He pulled up Harrington's lab notebook, the final entries before Sterling's death.

_February 2: Final compound ready. Deployment awaits optimal opportunity._

_February 7: Opportunity arises. Meeting scheduled for February 8. Will assess situation._

_February 8: Deployment successful._

"She didn't know he was going to apologize," Reeves said. "She thought the February eighth meeting would be another confrontation about Sarah. She brought the poison ready to use if Sterling remained adamant about destroying Sarah's career."

"Self-defense?" Walsh asked skeptically. "Career defense?"

"No. Premeditated murder with conditional execution." Reeves stood, pacing. "She spent months creating the poison, but she waited for the right moment to use it. When Sterling invited her to discuss Sarah, she thought that was the moment—her last chance to stop him before he officially removed Sarah from the program."

"But he was actually going to tell her he'd changed his mind," Chen said. "So what happened in that meeting? What did Sterling say that made her inject him anyway?"

That was the question Reeves couldn't answer from evidence alone. They'd never know exactly what was said in Sterling's study on the afternoon of February eighth. Whether he'd started to explain his change of heart before Harrington acted. Whether she'd injected him before he could speak, or after he'd said something she misinterpreted.

The only person who knew was Harrington herself.

"The terminal diagnosis doesn't change the case," Reeves said finally. "It's not suicide—Sterling was trying to make amends, not kill himself. It's not mercy killing—Harrington didn't know he was dying and her notes show no mercy motivation. It's premeditated murder based on incomplete information about the victim's intentions."

"But it's context," Walsh argued. "When we present this to the DA, to a jury—Sterling was dying anyway. He had months left. Does that mitigate Harrington's crime?"

"No," Chen said firmly. "Murder is murder. You don't get partial credit for killing someone who's already terminal."

"But the defense will use it," Walsh persisted. "They'll argue Harrington saved Sterling from a painful death, that she prevented him from changing his mind about reforms and going back to his cruel ways."

Reeves thought about it, about how a skilled attorney like Patricia Cowan would present this to a jury. _Ladies and gentlemen, Dr. Harrington acted to stop a man who had destroyed dozens of lives. She didn't know he was dying. She didn't know he'd invited her to apologize. She knew only that Professor Sterling had tried to ruin another brilliant young woman's career, and that he had to be stopped._

It wouldn't excuse the murder legally, but it might create reasonable doubt about premeditation. Or at least about malice.

"We need her confession," Reeves said. "We need Harrington to explain what happened in that meeting, what Sterling said, why she deployed the poison. The physical evidence proves she did it, but only she can tell us why."

"And she's lawyered up," Walsh reminded him. "Patricia Cowan isn't going to let her talk."

"Then we need to give her a reason to want to talk." Reeves looked at the evidence spread across the conference room—the poison book, the notes, the timeline, the medical records. "She documented this entire murder because she's proud of the work. Because she wants someone to understand how brilliant it was. We use that."

Chen frowned. "How?"

"We tell her we found the poison." Reeves felt the plan forming. "We lie. We say our lab analysis detected the compound in Sterling's tissue, that we know exactly what she used and how it worked. She'll react—she'll want to know how we found something she designed to be undetectable. And in that reaction, she'll reveal knowledge only the killer could have."

"That's risky," Walsh warned. "If she stays quiet, we gain nothing. If she asks for details and we can't provide them, she'll know we're bluffing."

"But if she's as proud of that compound as I think she is," Reeves countered, "she won't be able to resist correcting us if we get the details wrong. Scientists don't like people misunderstanding their work."

Ethan had been quiet, studying Sterling's letter inviting Harrington to meet. "There's somethin' else," he said slowly. "Sterling wrote this letter on February seventh. Harrington injected him on the eighth. But the poison took seventy-two hours to activate, which means Sterling died on the eleventh. For three days, he was walkin' around with that delayed-release compound in his system, not knowin' he was already dead."

The room fell silent.

"He spent his last three days trying to make amends," Chen said quietly. "Writing letters, having reconciliation conversations, planning his legacy. All while the poison was working through his system."

"Did Harrington know that's what would happen?" Ethan asked. "Did she understand he'd have those three days?"

Reeves checked her notes. There, in the February 2 entry: _Delayed-release mechanism confirmed at 72 hours. Subject will be asymptomatic until cardiac event. Allows time for subject to maintain normal activities, reducing suspicion._

"She knew," Reeves said. "She designed it that way deliberately. So Sterling wouldn't seem sick, wouldn't raise suspicions. But that also meant..."

"She gave him three days he thought were normal days," Ethan finished. "Three days to make peace, not knowin' he was dyin' by poison instead of cancer."

Another layer of tragedy. Sterling, terminal with cancer, using his remaining time to reconcile with those he'd wronged. Not knowing that time had been stolen by the very person he'd invited to apologize to.

"This doesn't help our case," Walsh said. "If anything, it makes it more complicated. Defense will argue Harrington couldn't have known Sterling was changing, that she acted based on decades of evidence of his cruelty, that the terminal diagnosis—if she'd known—would have changed everything."

"But she didn't know," Reeves insisted. "That's what matters. She committed premeditated murder based on assumption and incomplete information. She never gave Sterling the chance to explain, to change, to make amends."

"Because he never gave his victims that chance," Chen pointed out. "He destroyed careers without warning, without opportunity for defense. One could argue Harrington simply gave him what he'd given others."

"Are you defending her?" Reeves asked sharply.

"I'm playing devil's advocate. Because that's what Patricia Cowan will do." Chen met his eyes. "We need to understand all the arguments before we confront Harrington. This case isn't as simple as brilliant doctor commits perfect murder. It's brilliant doctor commits perfect murder against cruel professor who was secretly dying and trying to reform. Every detail adds complexity."

She was right. Reeves had wanted this to be clean—proof of murder, proof of killer, case closed. But the reality was messier. Harrington had killed Sterling, yes. But Sterling had been dying anyway. Harrington thought she was stopping future harm. But Sterling was already trying to stop that harm himself. Harrington never knew about the diagnosis. But would it have mattered if she had?

"We present all of it to the DA," Reeves decided. "The premeditation, the method, the motive, the terminal diagnosis, Sterling's attempts at reconciliation, all of it. We give Brennan the complete picture and let her decide how to prosecute."

"And the confrontation?" Walsh asked.

"We tell Harrington we found the poison. We see how she reacts. We get her confession." Reeves looked at the medical file on his screen, at Sterling's final months documented in clinical detail. "And then we let the system decide if murder of a dying man who was trying to change is somehow different from ordinary murder."

"When do we move?" Walsh asked.

"Tomorrow. Give me today to prepare, to review every piece of evidence, to plan exactly what to say." Reeves thought about Webb, about his mentor's death that was never solved. "We get one chance at this. I want to make sure we do it right."

After the others left, Reeves sat alone with Sterling's medical records. Stage IV pancreatic cancer. Three to six months. The professor had known he was dying and had chosen to spend that time trying to make peace.

It didn't excuse forty years of cruelty. It didn't undo the careers he'd destroyed. But it was something. An attempt at redemption, however late.

Harrington had stolen that. With the best of intentions, with the noblest of motives—saving Sarah Kim and future students—she'd stolen Sterling's chance at redemption and her own chance at being right.

Because if she'd waited just one more day, if she'd let Sterling speak before injecting him, she would have learned he'd changed his mind about Sarah. She would have won without becoming a murderer.

Perfect intelligence creating the perfect poison for the perfect crime—all based on imperfect information.

Tomorrow, Reeves would confront her with that irony. Tomorrow, he'd spring the trap about finding the poison, watch her react, get his confession.

Tonight, he went home and thought about how justice worked when everyone involved was partially right and partially wrong. When a murder victim was both cruel and reforming. When a killer was both brilliant and blind.

The perfect crime had been solved. Understanding it—that would take longer.
