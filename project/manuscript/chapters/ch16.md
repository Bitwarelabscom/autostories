# Chapter 16: Coordinates

Chen Wei walked into the interview room at 2 PM carrying nothing but her phone and her fear.

Sara and a customs officer—introduced as Inspector Lundgren—sat across the table. A recorder blinked red in the corner. Everything official, everything documented.

"Thank you for coming in," Sara said. Her voice was professional but not hostile. "We have some follow-up questions about container access patterns during the investigation period."

Chen nodded. Her hands were folded in her lap, gripping each other tightly enough to hurt.

Sara laid out printouts. Access logs, timestamp correlations, pattern analysis. Every time Chen had logged into the port's container management system during a smuggling operation, highlighted in yellow.

Thirty-two instances over eight months. Thirty-two perfect correlations.

"These are your access credentials," Sara said. "Can you explain the pattern?"

Chen could lie. Could say she'd noticed nothing unusual, that her job involved constant system access, that correlation wasn't causation.

Instead, she heard herself say: "I need protection for my family in China."

Silence. Lundgren glanced at Sara.

"Tell me what happened," Sara said quietly.

So Chen did.

It took forty minutes. The initial contact through encrypted messaging. The photographs of her parents' apartment, her brother walking to school. The polite threats. The technical training they'd provided—how to spoof the container tracking system, how to create ghost manifests that would pass automated verification.

The cryptocurrency payments that appeared in her wallet after each successful operation.

"I know I took the money," Chen said. Her voice was steady now. The worst part was saying it out loud. "I could say it was all coercion, but that's not completely true. I was scared, but I also... accepted it. Used it. I'm not just a victim."

"No," Sara agreed. "You're not. But you're also not the person we most want. We want the network. The people who recruited you, who threatened your family, who are running the smuggling operation."

Chen looked up. "I don't know who they are. I only dealt with intermediaries. Encrypted communications, cryptocurrency, anonymous."

"But you have information," Sara said. "Container numbers, dates, routes. That's what we need to dismantle the network."

"If I cooperate, what happens to me?"

"Witness protection. Testimony against the network. Immigration will work with us—you won't be deported. You'll relocate somewhere in Sweden, new identity, support for integration."

"And my family in China?"

Sara and Lundgren exchanged glances. "That's more complicated," Sara admitted. "We can coordinate with international authorities, but we can't guarantee their safety. I won't lie to you about that."

Chen closed her eyes. Her family would be at risk whether she cooperated or not. At least this way, the smuggling network would face consequences too.

"I have a thumb drive," she said. "At my apartment. Documentation of everything. Every shipment, every container number, manifests, communication logs. I kept copies."

"Smart," Sara said.

"Insurance," Chen said. "I knew this day would come."

Twenty minutes later, Chen was in a safe house with a protection detail. The thumb drive was in Emil's lab. The port smuggling case was effectively closed.

The tactical planning meeting started at 4 PM. Sara and Emil, two officers from the tactical unit, a representative from the prosecutor's office, and Inspector Lundgren coordinating the port operation.

Maps of Malmö spread across the conference table. Yusuf Hassan's home address in Rosengård, his workplace in Västra Hamnen, the community tech center where he volunteered.

"Surveillance confirms subject is at work," one of the tactical officers reported. "Regular schedule, leaves at 5:30 PM, takes bus 5 to Rosengård, arrives home approximately 6:15 PM."

"Apartment is third floor, his parents' building," Emil added. "Neighbors are mostly families, older residents. We want to avoid public confrontation if possible."

"Risk assessment?" the prosecutor asked.

"Non-violent," Sara said. "No history of aggression. But sophisticated technical capabilities. If we give him any warning, he'll destroy evidence or activate countermeasures."

"What kind of countermeasures?"

Emil pulled up Hassan's profile. "He's an expert in adversarial machine learning. He could have dead man's switches, automated evidence deletion, encrypted backups triggered by specific conditions. We need to isolate his network access before we breach."

"Can we do that?"

"We can coordinate with his ISP to cut his connection at a specific time. But he might have cellular backup, or pre-positioned hardware elsewhere."

The tactical officer frowned. "So we're looking at a standard warrant execution with technical complications?"

"Yes," Emil said. "But also—" He glanced at Sara. "Detective Lindqvist has proposed an alternative approach."

Everyone looked at Sara.

"Hassan is ideologically motivated," she said. "He's not a typical criminal. He's a teacher who believes he's exposing systemic failures. If we kick down his door, we get a hostile suspect and probable evidence destruction. If we approach him differently..."

"How differently?" the prosecutor asked, suspicion in his voice.

"Let me talk to him first. Before the tactical team moves in. Explain that we understand his motivation, that we have evidence, that he has a choice about how this ends."

"That's not protocol."

"No. But protocol gets us a lawyer and years of appeals and Hassan positioned as a martyr to his community." Sara kept her voice level. "I've read his thesis, his forum posts, his entire digital history. He wants to be understood. He wants his point to be seen. If we give him that—acknowledge the systemic problems he's exposed while still holding him accountable—we might get cooperation instead of confrontation."

The prosecutor was shaking his head. "Too risky. He could run, destroy evidence, alert associates—"

"He could," Sara agreed. "But I don't think he will. Everything about his profile says he wants to be right, to prove his point. Running makes him look guilty. Destroying evidence means his documentation disappears. He's been building a case against the system. I don't think he'll throw that away."

"This is your career on the line," the prosecutor said.

"I know."

Silence around the table. Then Lundgren spoke up. "Inspector Chen's cooperation came from honest conversation, not coercion. Sometimes unorthodox approaches work."

The tactical officer looked skeptical but nodded. "If we do this, we position the team nearby. First sign of trouble, we move in. And someone needs to have eyes on him the whole time."

"Agreed," Sara said.

Emil was watching her with an expression she couldn't quite read. Concerned, maybe. Or impressed.

"Tomorrow," the prosecutor said finally. "We move tomorrow afternoon. Port raids at 5 PM—Europol is coordinating with customs. Hassan approach at 6 PM, after he's home from work. Tactical team staged in Rosengård, ready for immediate intervention. Detective Lindqvist makes first contact." He looked at Sara. "You have one chance. If this goes wrong, it's on you."

"Understood."

Yusuf sat in his small room, watching graphs populate across three monitors.

He'd been training the model for four days now. Data from every source he could access: police press releases, court documents, crime statistics, news articles about investigations. Public records of arrest patterns, prosecution timelines, tactical team deployment histories.

The model was learning how police investigations worked.

He'd started with simple questions: How long between identifying a suspect and executing a warrant? What time of day do tactical teams prefer for residential arrests? How do they coordinate multi-agency operations?

Then more complex: What factors predict whether police negotiate or use force? How do resource constraints affect timing? What patterns exist in successful prosecutions versus failed ones?

The model wasn't perfect. Police behavior involved human judgment, which was harder to predict than automated systems. But patterns existed. Organizations had rhythms, procedures, resource limitations. They left data exhaust too.

His current prediction: if they'd identified him—and they probably had by now, given that they'd arrested Katarina and would have analyzed all the forum data—they'd move within 48 to 72 hours. Warrants took time but not too much time. Evidence could be destroyed, suspects could run.

They'd come soon.

The model suggested highest probability for late afternoon or evening arrest. After he was home from work, when they could control the environment. Tactical team would stage nearby, probably in unmarked vehicles. They'd cut his network access before breaching.

Standard procedure. Predictable.

Yusuf pulled up his contingency plans. He'd prepared three scenarios:

One: Run. He had documents ready, cash, a route out of Sweden. Eastern Europe had looser extradition, and he had skills that translated anywhere. But running meant abandoning his family, his community, everything he'd been fighting for.

Two: Destroy everything. Wipe the servers, burn the hardware, eliminate all evidence. But that also eliminated his documentation of systemic vulnerabilities. The whole point had been to expose the systems, not just exploit them for personal gain.

Three: Prepare for capture. Document everything, encrypt and distribute the files to trusted contacts, set up dead man's switches that would release everything publicly if he disappeared. Turn the arrest into proof of his argument.

Option three was winning. He'd been backing up data all week, distributing encrypted archives, preparing explanatory documents. If they arrested him, the story would spread. "Rosengård man arrested for exposing algorithmic discrimination." The irony would be perfect.

But there was a fourth option he kept circling back to. One the model couldn't predict because it wasn't based on pattern data.

What if they offered him something real? Not just a reduced sentence, but actual systemic change. What if someone in law enforcement actually understood what he'd been trying to prove?

Unlikely. The system protected itself.

But not impossible.

Yusuf saved his work and encrypted the drives. Whatever happened tomorrow or the day after, he'd be ready.

Sara sat in her car outside the Limhamn Harbor at sunset, watching the lights come on across the shipping terminal.

Her father had worked here for twenty-five years. She could picture him on the docks, coordinating crane operations, tracking manifests, solving the logistics puzzles that kept cargo flowing.

Then the automation came. Algorithmic scheduling, predictive loading, automated crane systems. The computers were faster, more efficient, didn't need benefits or breaks.

Her father had been fifty-three. Too old to retrain, too experienced to accept entry-level work elsewhere, too proud to take disability he didn't quite qualify for.

He'd died two years later. Heart attack, officially. But Sara knew it was the obsolescence that killed him. The slow realization that everything he'd built his identity around had become worthless.

She thought about Yusuf Hassan. Twenty-eight years old, brilliant, hardworking. Top of his class, exceptional technical ability, strong ideological commitment. Everything society claimed to want.

Except he had the wrong address, the wrong name, the wrong background for the algorithms' learned patterns of success.

Her father had been made obsolete by the systems. Yusuf had been locked out by them.

Different responses, same wound.

Her father had withdrawn, gotten depressed, given up. Yusuf had fought back, learned to exploit the systems that excluded him, taught others to do the same.

Was one response better than the other? More moral?

Sara didn't know. Her father had hurt no one but himself. Yusuf had committed crimes, taught others to commit crimes, hurt people in his own community through his pharmacy robberies.

But her father's quiet suffering had changed nothing. While Yusuf's algorithmic crimes had forced people like Sara to actually look at the systems, to see how they worked, to understand the exclusion and discrimination built into supposedly neutral algorithms.

Both men had been wronged by the same automated infrastructure of surveillance capitalism. One had died invisible. The other had made himself impossible to ignore.

Tomorrow, she'd arrest the one who fought back.

And she'd try—probably fail, but try—to acknowledge that he'd been right about the systems, even while holding him accountable for breaking the law.

Maybe that was the best she could do. See both truths. Hold both realities.

Her phone buzzed. Emil.

*Everything in position. Chen Wei's testimony is detailed and actionable. Europol is coordinating port raids for tomorrow 5 PM. Tactical team briefed for Hassan approach at 6 PM. Surveillance confirms he's following normal routine.*

Sara typed back: *See you tomorrow morning. Get some sleep.*

*You too.*

She wouldn't sleep well tonight. Too much planning, too many what-ifs, too much weight on her unconventional choice.

But she'd learned something through this investigation. The conventional approaches weren't working. Algorithmic crime was emerging because the systems themselves were broken, creating desperate, skilled people with the knowledge to exploit them.

You couldn't arrest your way out of a systemic problem.

But maybe—maybe—you could start building something different. Case by case, choice by choice, conversation by conversation.

Sara started her car and drove home through the winter darkness, preparing for tomorrow's confrontation with a teacher who'd decided to fight the algorithms that excluded him.

She hoped he'd be ready to teach one more lesson.
