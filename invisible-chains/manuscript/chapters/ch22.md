# Chapter 22: The Hunt Begins

Agents Reeves and Sato entered Level 9 wearing Gamma worker coveralls, their SSS tactical gear hidden beneath the stained fabric. They looked like every other exhausted laborer returning from a double shift in the recycling plants. Nobody looked twice.

That was the thing about being Gamma. You were invisible.

Reeves had gone undercover before, but never this deep. Level 9 smelled like rust and recycled water, the air thick with humidity that made everything damp. The perpetual condensation dripped from overhead pipes, creating the rain that supposedly never stopped. His boots splashed through puddles that had probably been there for decades.

"This is disgusting," he muttered into his concealed comm.

"Focus," Sato replied. She moved ahead of him with more confidence, her smaller frame better suited to the cramped corridors. "We're looking for patterns. Quinn wouldn't stay in the worst sections. She'd want some comfort even undercover."

They'd been given Quinn's last known general location—somewhere in the three-block area the locals called the Free Level. Intel suggested it was some kind of community project funded by the Gamma criminal Jax Varro. The same criminal Quinn had been investigating for two years while filing reports that said he was low-threat.

The same criminal she'd apparently sided with instead of the SSS.

Reeves still didn't want to believe it. He'd worked with Quinn on the Chen Syndicate takedown three years ago. She'd been by-the-book, dedicated, willing to do what was necessary for station security. The idea that she'd betrayed everything they stood for didn't compute.

But Ashton's evidence was compelling. And the Director didn't make mistakes.

They emerged from a narrow maintenance corridor into a wider thoroughfare, and Reeves stopped.

This didn't look like the undercity he'd seen in surveillance footage.

The corridor was clean. Not spotless, but the accumulated filth had been cleared away. The walls still showed rust and decay, but someone had painted over sections—bright murals of impossible flowers and blue skies that had never existed on this station. The overhead lighting actually worked. And the people...

The Gammas walking past didn't have that defeated shuffle he'd seen in enforcement footage. They walked upright. Some were talking, even laughing. A vendor had set up a stall selling what looked like actual fresh vegetables.

"Reeves," Sato said quietly. "The reports were wrong."

"Yeah." He activated his concealed camera, capturing everything. "This isn't contained at all."

They split up to cover more ground, agreed to meet in two hours. Reeves wandered deeper into the Free Level, his trained eye cataloging everything. Water purification station, illegally tapped into main station systems. Hydroponic gardens under grow-lights that had definitely been stolen from Level 6 agriculture. A medical clinic with equipment that would have cost millions on the black market.

This wasn't some small-time criminal operation. This was infrastructure. Community. A functioning society that technically shouldn't exist.

He photographed everything, downloaded feeds from his hidden sensors, compiled the evidence Ashton would need to justify a full crackdown. Part of him felt sick doing it. These people looked... happy. Healthier than Gammas had a right to be.

But that wasn't his job. His job was to maintain order. Protect the station's social structure. If Gammas started thinking they could build their own communities, bypass the caste system entirely, where would it end?

Still. Watching a mother and daughter walk past, the kid actually skipping, not cowering—it was hard not to wonder if maybe Quinn had seen something here they couldn't from up above.

He pushed the thought away. That kind of thinking compromised operations.

His comm buzzed. Sato. "Got something. West corridor, community center. You need to see this."

---

The community center was larger than Reeves expected, a converted storage bay with the heavy machinery removed and tables set up. Fifty or sixty people gathered for what looked like a communal meal. The smell of actual cooking food hit him—not the standard Gamma rations of reconstituted protein, but real vegetables and grain.

Sato stood in the shadows near the entrance, her face carefully neutral. "There," she said quietly, nodding toward a table in the back.

Reeves followed her gaze and felt his stomach drop.

Elara Quinn sat at a table with three other women, laughing at something one of them said. She wore simple work clothes, her hair tied back in a practical style, no makeup. She looked nothing like the polished SSS investigator he'd known. She looked comfortable. At home.

And sitting across from her, leaning close to say something that made her smile, was a Gamma man who had to be Jax Varro. Stocky build, scarred knuckles, that particular alertness of someone who'd survived by staying ready for violence.

Reeves activated his camera again, captured the scene. The way Quinn touched Varro's hand across the table. The intimacy of it. The way she belonged here.

"That's her," Sato confirmed unnecessarily. "And I count four hundred people in this sector. The reports said minimal population, declining interest. This is..."

"A full community," Reeves finished. "She's been lying for two years."

They watched for another twenty minutes, documenting everything. Quinn never looked their way, never showed any sign she'd made them. Either her tradecraft had gotten sloppy, or she genuinely didn't care anymore if she was caught.

The latter scared him more.

Finally, they slipped away, made their way back to the access tunnel that would take them to Level 8. They didn't speak until they were clear, back in a maintenance closet on a secure level.

"We need to report this to Ashton immediately," Sato said. She looked shaken. "Quinn's completely compromised. And this Free Level operation is a legitimate threat. If word spreads that Gammas can just opt out of the system, build their own infrastructure—"

"It undermines everything," Reeves agreed. He felt hollow. "The entire caste structure depends on Gammas accepting their place. This is rebellion."

"What do we do?"

Reeves thought about Quinn's smile, the way she'd looked at Varro. Thought about the murals on the walls, the gardens, the children who didn't look broken.

Then he thought about his oath to the SSS. His duty.

"We give Ashton everything we found," he said. "Let him decide how to handle it."

---

Ashton reviewed their report in silence, watching the footage on his office screen. Quinn laughing. Quinn touching the Gamma criminal. Quinn looking more alive than he'd ever seen her look in six years of service.

His hands shook as he paused the video on her face.

He'd trained her himself. Recruited her out of Alpha Security Services because she'd shown exceptional intelligence and dedication. Mentored her through difficult operations. Trusted her with sensitive assignments.

And she'd betrayed him completely.

The community itself was almost secondary to that personal wound. Almost. But the footage Reeves and Sato had provided showed something Ashton had feared for years—organized Gamma resistance. Not violence, which could be crushed with force. But something harder to fight: an alternative.

If Gammas could build their own functioning society, they didn't need the station's systems. Didn't need to accept their place. And if three blocks could do it, why not thirty? Why not the entire undercity?

The caste system was absolute. Genetically enforced. Unchangeable. Except here was proof that genetics didn't matter if people refused to participate in the system at all.

His comm chimed. Reeves and Sato stood at attention in his doorway.

"Recommendations?" he asked.

"Full tactical shutdown," Reeves said. "Arrest Varro, shut down the infrastructure, disperse the population. Make an example."

"And Quinn?"

The agents exchanged glances. "Sir," Sato said carefully, "Senior Investigator Quinn has clearly been compromised. Standard protocol would be extraction and debriefing, but given the evidence..."

"You think she'd resist extraction."

"Yes, sir."

Ashton nodded slowly. He'd known Elara for six years. She was stubborn, brilliant, and when she committed to something, she committed fully. If she'd decided Varro's operation was worth protecting, she wouldn't come quietly.

Which meant he needed leverage.

"Here's what we're going to do," he said, voice perfectly controlled despite the rage burning through him. "We're going to expose her. Publicly. To the people she's been protecting."

Reeves frowned. "Sir?"

"The Free Level residents think she's one of them. A Beta fugitive, that's her cover?" He pulled up Quinn's file, her official SSS identification photo. "We're going to show them exactly who Elara Frost really is. Alpha elite. SSS Senior Investigator. Their enemy, living among them for two years."

"They'll turn on her," Sato said.

"Yes." Ashton felt cold saying it, but it was the right play. "And when she's isolated, alone, hunted by her own people—then we offer extraction. She comes home and faces consequences for her betrayal, or she dies in the undercity she chose over us."

"And if she still refuses?"

Ashton's jaw tightened. "Then we have visual confirmation that she's an enemy combatant and can proceed with terminal force. But I don't think it will come to that. Elara's smart. When she realizes what she's lost, she'll come back."

He had to believe that. Because the alternative—that she'd choose a Gamma criminal over the SSS, over him—was too much to accept.

"Prep the exposure broadcast," he ordered. "I want every screen in the Free Level showing Quinn's true identity. Make sure Varro sees it. Make sure everyone sees what she really is."

The agents salked away to execute his orders. Ashton sat alone in his office, pulled up the footage again. Froze on Quinn's face, that smile he'd never seen her wear before.

She looked happy. Genuinely, completely happy.

He deleted the image, turned off the screen.

If she'd wanted happiness, she shouldn't have betrayed everything she swore to protect. Shouldn't have betrayed him. Now she'd learn what happened to people who thought they could walk away from their duty, their caste, their nature.

The Free Level thought it was paradise. He was going to show them it was still hell. And hell always had a price.

His hands stopped shaking. Purpose steadied them.

The hunt was on. And it would end the only way these things ever ended: with someone broken, someone punished, and order restored.

That was his job. That was his duty.

Even if it meant destroying the woman he'd thought of as a daughter, he would do it.

For the good of the station.
