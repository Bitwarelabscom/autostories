# Chapter 16: Getting Close

Jax watched me for three days before he spoke to me alone.

I felt his attention like weight. At community meetings, across the distribution center, in the hallways of Building 47 where I'd started volunteering in the kitchen. He was assessing me the way I was assessing him, and we both knew it.

The game would have been easier if he wasn't exactly what I'd been trained to resist.

I'd interrogated gang leaders and corporate criminals and black market operators. I knew how to handle charm, how to deflect attraction, how to keep my professional distance. But Jax Varro wasn't trying to charm me. He was just... present. Solid. Real in a way that made everyone else feel like they were performing.

And I couldn't stop watching him back.

"Elara Frost."

His voice came from behind me while I was washing dishes after dinner service. I didn't jump - I'd been trained better than that - but something in my chest tightened.

I turned. He was leaning in the doorway, arms crossed, studying me with those tired eyes that saw too much.

"Jax Varro," I said back.

"You've been volunteering a lot. Three days straight in the kitchen."

"I need to do something. Sitting in my apartment feeling grateful seemed insufficient."

"Most people fleeing debt collectors don't volunteer for dish duty."

"Maybe I'm not most people."

"No." He pushed off the doorframe, came closer. Not threatening, just... present. "You're not."

The kitchen was empty except for us. Everyone else had scattered after cleanup, tired from feeding two hundred people. The space felt smaller with him in it.

"You're watching me," I said. "I can feel it."

"You're watching me too."

"You're the one running this operation. Of course I'm curious."

"Is that all it is? Curiosity?" He was close enough now that I could see the scars on his knuckles, the silver in his black hair, the way his jaw tightened when he was thinking. "Because Mother Sera says you ask a lot of questions. Very specific questions about funding and supply chains and operational structure."

My training kicked in. "I'm trying to understand how this works. What makes it sustainable. Whether it's real or if it's going to collapse and leave us all worse off than before."

"Reasonable concerns."

"Then why are you looking at me like I'm lying?"

"Because you are." He said it calmly, without accusation. "Not about everything. But about something. You're too controlled. Too deliberate. You move like someone who's trained to be invisible."

I kept my expression neutral. "I worked manufacturing for eight years. You learn to be invisible or you get noticed by supervisors looking for someone to blame."

"Maybe." He turned away, looked out the kitchen window at the neon-lit rain. "Or maybe you're something else. Beta worker running from debts doesn't quite fit. You don't have the desperation. Don't have the relief. You just have... questions."

"Would you prefer I leave?"

"No." The answer came fast enough to be honest. "I'd prefer you stay. Even if you're hiding something. Even if you're here for reasons I don't understand yet."

The admission hung in the air between us.

"Why?" I asked.

He looked back at me, and something in his expression made my breath catch. "Because I want to know what you're hiding. And because watching you is the most interesting thing that's happened to me in months."

The honesty was dangerous. More dangerous than lies would have been.

"I should go," I said.

"Probably." He didn't move to stop me. "But you won't. Because whatever you're looking for, you haven't found it yet."

He was right. I hated that he was right.

I left the kitchen with my cover intact but my composure fracturing.

---

I reported to Ashton that night through encrypted channels.

*Subject: Jax Varro. Male, late twenties, Gamma caste. Source of Free Level funding confirmed as personal wealth, origin under investigation. Operation appears genuine - no signs of criminal activity, trafficking, or weapons distribution. Recommend continued monitoring but downgrade threat assessment.*

It was a lie. Not in the facts, but in the framing.

I didn't mention that Jax was perceptive enough to see through parts of my cover. Didn't mention the way my heart raced when he got close. Didn't mention that I was starting to think the real threat wasn't to station security, but to my own certainty that the caste system was natural and necessary.

Ashton's response came an hour later: *Continue investigation. Identify all funding sources. Determine long-term intentions. Do not compromise cover.*

I stared at the message until my neural interface timed out.

Don't compromise cover.

Too late for that. I'd compromised it the moment I admitted, even to myself, that Jax Varro was more than a target.

---

He found me two days later on the roof of Building 47.

I'd gone up to think, to breathe air that didn't smell like kitchen grease and too many people in close quarters. The roof was technically restricted - structural concerns, safety violations - but the locks were trivial to bypass with my training.

I heard his footsteps before he spoke.

"Hoping for a different view?" he asked.

I didn't turn around. "The view from my window was getting repetitive."

He came to stand beside me at the edge. Below us, the undercity spread out in all its neon-soaked decay. Beautiful and broken at the same time.

"You picked the lock," he said.

"It was easy."

"Beta manufacturing workers don't usually have lock-picking skills."

"Beta manufacturing workers who want to survive learn all kinds of skills." I finally looked at him. "Are you going to report me for roof access?"

"No." He was watching the city instead of me. "I come up here sometimes too. When the weight gets too heavy."

"What weight?"

"Four thousand people depending on me not to fuck this up. Billions of credits that could disappear tomorrow. Station authority watching and waiting for an excuse to shut us down." He pulled out a vial - Drift, I recognized the luminescent liquid. Took a hit without apology. "The weight of trying to build something that matters when I'm just one person with money I found by accident."

The honesty caught me off-guard. I'd been trained to expect defensiveness, calculation, carefully managed images. Not this raw admission of doubt.

"You could leave," I said. "Take the money and go."

"Can't. Tried. Scanner read my DNA and told me I'm not allowed." He said it without bitterness, just fact. "I'm genetically barred from leaving Level 9. So I built this instead."

My training had covered this - the genetic markers, the restriction systems. But knowing it academically was different from hearing someone describe their own imprisonment.

"I'm sorry," I said, and meant it.

"Don't be. If I could leave, none of this would exist. Four thousand people would still be starving in condemned buildings. Sometimes the cage is what forces you to do something that matters."

He offered me the Drift. I shook my head.

"Smart," he said. "This stuff will ruin you if you let it. I let it."

"Then why use it?"

"Because some nights the weight is too heavy and I need it to feel light again. Even if it's chemical. Even if it's temporary." He took another hit, and I watched his shoulders relax slightly. "What's your weight, Elara Frost? What are you running from that's heavy enough to bring you to the undercity?"

I could have deflected. Should have. Instead I found myself telling a version of the truth.

"The feeling that I'm participating in something wrong. That the life I built is based on other people suffering. That maybe I deserve to lose it."

"Gambling debts don't usually inspire existential guilt."

"Maybe mine did."

He looked at me then, really looked, and I felt exposed in a way that had nothing to do with my cover being blown.

"You're not what you pretend to be," he said.

"Neither are you."

"I'm exactly what I pretend to be. A Gamma who got lucky and is trying not to waste it." He moved closer, and I didn't step back. "But you... you're something else. Someone who came here looking for something specific. I just haven't figured out what yet."

"Maybe I came here looking for proof that people can be better than the system that made them."

"And did you find it?"

I thought about the Free Level. About people being fed and housed and cared for. About labor songs sung by children who'd never known their grandparents had fought and died for the same dreams. About a former drug dealer building a community because his cage had forced him to care.

"Yes," I said. "I think I did."

Something shifted in his expression. "You're dangerous, Elara Frost."

"Why?"

"Because you make me want to trust you. And I've learned not to trust people who make me feel things."

The air between us felt electric. We were too close, standing on a rooftop above a city that smelled like rust and rain, and I knew I should step back. Should maintain my professional distance. Should remember I was undercover investigating a potential threat.

Instead I said, "What do I make you feel?"

"Like maybe I'm not as alone as I thought I was."

He kissed me before I could think of a response.

It wasn't gentle. Wasn't tentative. It was desperate and certain at the same time, his hands on my face like he was afraid I'd disappear. I kissed him back before my training could stop me, and it felt like falling, like jumping off the roof and trusting the impact wouldn't kill me.

He tasted like Drift and rain.

I pulled away first, breathing hard. "This is a bad idea."

"I know."

"I'm not who you think I am."

"I know that too." He touched my face, gentle this time. "But right now, I don't care."

I should have left. Should have extracted myself from the situation before it became more complicated.

I kissed him again instead.

---

I didn't report the kiss to Ashton.

Didn't report that Jax Varro was perceptive enough to see through my cover. Didn't report that I was compromised in ways that went beyond professional boundaries.

Instead I wrote: *Integration successful. Have gained subject's trust. Continuing investigation of funding sources and long-term intentions.*

The lies were getting easier.

That should have worried me more than it did.

---

Finn cornered me three days later in the distribution center.

"We need to talk," they said, voice flat.

I followed them to a supply room, watched them close the door with deliberate care.

"You're sleeping with him," Finn said.

I didn't bother denying it. "Is that a problem?"

"It is if you're using him."

"I'm not—"

"You're not a Beta worker fleeing debts. I've seen Beta workers my whole life. You're not desperate enough, not broken enough. You move like someone trained for violence. You ask questions like someone gathering intelligence." Finn's eyes were hard. "So I'm asking you directly: are you using Jax?"

I could have lied. My training gave me a dozen deflections, explanations, ways to redirect suspicion.

"It started that way," I said instead. "It's not anymore."

"What is it now?"

"I don't know. Something I didn't plan for. Something that's making me question everything I thought I knew."

Finn studied me for a long moment. "If you hurt him, I'll make sure you regret it. I don't care what training you have or where you come from. He's been broken enough. He doesn't need you breaking him worse."

"I know."

"Do you? Because he's falling for you. Actually falling, not just attracted. And when he finds out you've been lying to him..." Finn shook their head. "That's going to destroy something in him that's barely holding together."

The words hit harder than they should have. Because Finn was right. Because I could feel Jax opening up to me, trusting me, and every moment I didn't tell him the truth was another betrayal.

"What do you want me to do?" I asked.

"Tell him who you really are. Or leave before you do more damage." Finn opened the door. "Those are your options. Pick one."

They left me alone in the supply room with my lies and my guilt and the taste of Drift-laced kisses I couldn't forget.

---

I found Jax that night in his office, surrounded by property listings and financial projections.

"We need to talk," I said.

He looked up, and his expression shifted when he saw mine. "That sounds ominous."

"I need to tell you something. About who I am. Why I'm really here."

He set down the papers he'd been reviewing. "Okay."

I opened my mouth to confess. To tell him I was SSS, that I'd been sent to investigate him, that everything between us had started as a mission.

And I couldn't do it.

Couldn't watch him realize I'd been lying. Couldn't see the trust drain from his eyes. Couldn't be the person who broke the one thing he'd let himself hope for.

"I'm falling for you," I said instead. "And it scares me."

It wasn't the truth I'd meant to tell. But it was truth.

He stood, came around the desk, pulled me close. "Good. I'm terrified too."

He kissed me, and I kissed him back, and I hated myself for the relief I felt at postponing the confession.

Tomorrow, I told myself. Tomorrow I'll tell him.

But tomorrow, I made the same excuse.

And the next day.

And the next.

The lies were getting easier.

And that was the most terrifying thing of all.
