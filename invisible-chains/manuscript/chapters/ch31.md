# Chapter 31: Mother Sera's Message

Jax was on his third day of the Drift cycle when Sera came to him.

Up, down, up, down. Use, crash, use again. The rhythm was familiar from his years before the Free Level. Comfortable in its predictability. Drift didn't lie. Drift didn't pretend. Drift just made everything soft and distant and bearable.

Finn had given up trying to stop him. Now they just made sure he ate, made sure he didn't choke on his own vomit, made sure the community didn't see their leader falling apart.

"Jax." Sera's voice cut through the haze. "Sit up. We need to talk."

He blinked at her from the ruined bed. "Not now, Sera."

"Yes, now." She sat in the one intact chair, breathing labored from the walk. "I've been talking to someone. Someone who has a proposal for you."

"Don't care."

"You will." She leaned forward. "What if I told you there was a way to break the caste system? Completely. Free every Gamma on this station."

That penetrated the Drift fog. "Not possible."

"It is. The genetic database that enforces caste—someone knows how to hack it. Corrupt the records. Make the scanners unable to identify who's what. Chaos, yes. But freedom."

Jax laughed bitterly. "Let me guess. This miraculous someone is Elara."

"Yes."

"No." He lay back down. "Not interested."

"Listen to the plan before—"

"I said no!" He sat up, anger cutting through the numbness. "She lied to me for two years! Everything was a lie! And now you want me to trust her with the most important operation we could ever attempt? With all our lives?"

"I'm not asking you to trust her," Sera said calmly. "I'm asking you to use her. She has knowledge we need. Access we can't get any other way. Use her skills, use her contacts, use her guilt. Get what you need and walk away."

"Why would she help us?"

"Because she's trying to make it right. Because she knows it won't earn forgiveness but wants to do it anyway. Because underneath all the lies, she actually cares about freeing the Gammas." Sera paused. "And because she loves you, still, even knowing you'll never love her back."

"She doesn't love me. She doesn't know how to love anything except her mission."

"You're wrong." Sera's certainty was absolute. "I've talked with her every day for a week. Watched her. Tested her. This isn't performance, Jax. This is real. She's changed."

"People don't change."

"You did. You went from drug dealer to community leader. Finn went from thief to organizer. I went from broken worker to keeper of memory." Sera's eyes blazed. "People change all the time, child. Question is whether you're brave enough to believe it."

Jax wanted more Drift. Wanted to sink back into numbness where this conversation didn't exist. But Sera's words had hooked him.

Freedom. Real freedom. Not just paradise in hell but actual escape from the genetic cage.

"Tell me the plan," he said.

Sera laid it out. The genetic database on Level 1. Elara's knowledge of security protocols. The inside contact. The virus that would corrupt caste records. The possibility of system-wide liberation.

It was insane. Impossible. Suicidal.

It was brilliant.

"She really thinks this can work?" Jax asked.

"She knows the risks. Knows it might fail. Knows we might all die trying. But yes, she thinks it can work."

"And after? If we succeed, if the system crashes, what then? Chaos and violence. Authority crackdown. Civil war."

"Maybe." Sera didn't flinch. "Or maybe freedom. Maybe a chance to build something better. Something real." She leaned forward. "Jax, I'm old. I won't live to see the world I'm fighting for. But you might. If you're willing to try."

"Why should I work with her? Why not just take the plan and do it without her?"

"Because you don't have her security clearance. Don't know the systems like she does. Don't have her contact. You need her." Sera's voice gentled. "I know it hurts. Know you feel betrayed. But sometimes you have to work with people who hurt you to achieve something bigger than personal pain."

Jax thought about the Free Level. About the hundreds of people who'd found hope here. About the thousands more still trapped in the system, still believing they deserved to be lesser.

About what it would mean to actually free them all.

"I want to talk to her," he said finally. "Alone. If I'm doing this, I need to hear it from her. Need to see her face when she proposes this insanity."

"I'll arrange it." Sera stood to leave.

"Sera?" She paused. "Why are you helping her? After what she did to us?"

The old woman smiled sadly. "Because I've lived long enough to know that yesterday's enemy can be tomorrow's ally. And because forgiveness isn't about whether someone deserves it. It's about whether you can afford to hold onto anger when there's work to be done."

She left him alone with his thoughts and his Drift and his impossible decision.

Work with Elara. Use her skills, her knowledge, her guilt. Attempt the impossible together.

It would mean seeing her again. Talking to her. Trusting her, at least enough to not sabotage the mission.

It would mean confronting everything he felt—the love he couldn't quite kill, the anger that wouldn't quite burn out, the confusion about what had been real.

But if it meant freedom...

If it meant breaking the system that had trapped him his entire life...

If it meant all the pain and lies and betrayal could be turned into something that mattered...

Maybe it was worth it.

Maybe she was right. Maybe one true thing could redeem two years of lies.

He reached for the Drift, then stopped.

This decision had to be made clear-headed. Had to be made clean.

For the first time in three days, Jax let the drug wear off without taking more.

Tomorrow he'd face Elara Quinn.

Tomorrow he'd hear her impossible plan.

Tomorrow he'd decide whether to forgive her, use her, or walk away.

But tonight, he'd be sober.

Tonight, he'd be ready.

The rain drummed on. Jax listened to it and tried to remember who he was before her. Tried to imagine who he could be after.

All he found was rage and pain and a terrible, crushing hope that maybe, just maybe, something good could come from this destruction.

Maybe.
