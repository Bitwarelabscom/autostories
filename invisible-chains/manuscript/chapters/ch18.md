# Chapter 18: The Truth Witnessed

I was on Level 8 when it happened.

Not undercover business - just a supply run. One of the Free Level's medical clinics needed equipment we couldn't get through undercity channels, so I'd volunteered to make the purchase from a legitimate vendor in Sector 3's commercial district. My temporary Beta credentials would pass casual scanning, and Level 8 was low enough security that Alpha investigators rarely bothered with it.

In and out. Two hours maximum. Back to the undercity before anyone noticed I was gone.

I was three blocks from the vendor when I heard the sirens.

SSS vehicles, six of them, converging on the residential section of Sector 7. I knew that sound - had heard it a thousand times during operations. The high-pitched wail that meant Station Security was moving in force.

I should have walked away. Minded my own business. Completed my supply run and returned to the Free Level.

Instead I followed.

I told myself it was professional curiosity. That I needed to understand SSS operations from the outside, from the perspective of someone who lived in fear of that sound. That I was still an investigator gathering intelligence, even if I wasn't sure who I was investigating anymore.

I told myself a lot of lies that day.

---

The SSS had cordoned off three blocks of residential housing.

Gamma housing - the kind of cramped, poorly maintained units the station provided to labor caste workers who served essential functions but didn't merit actual dignity. I'd seen them in reports, read statistics about occupancy rates and building violations. Never visited one in person.

Now I was standing at the edge of the cordon, watching armed officers in body armor move through the buildings like they were clearing a military installation instead of people's homes.

A crowd had gathered - mostly Gammas who lived nearby, watching with the resigned terror of people who knew they might be next. I joined them, keeping my head down, my Beta credentials visible enough to avoid suspicion.

"What's happening?" I asked the woman next to me.

She didn't look at me. "Random sweep. Looking for unregistered residents, employment fraud, contraband. Looking for excuses."

"Excuses for what?"

"To remind us what we are."

On the street, SSS officers were pulling people out of the buildings. Families. Workers coming home from shifts. Children who'd been doing homework or playing or just existing in spaces they'd been told were theirs.

The officers weren't gentle.

A man in work coveralls was shoved against a wall, hands forced behind his back while an officer scanned his DNA. The scan came back clean - he was registered, legal, compliant - but the officer hit him anyway. A casual backhand that split his lip, made him stagger.

"Gamma sector's over capacity," the officer said, loud enough for everyone to hear. "You're being relocated to Level 9. Get your things. You have ten minutes."

"I have a job," the man protested, blood on his chin. "I'm employed by—"

Another hit. Harder this time. The man went down.

"Nine minutes."

I watched it happen and felt something cold spread through my chest.

This was standard procedure. I'd read the protocols. Level 8 Gamma residential zones were monitored for overcrowding, and when occupancy exceeded quota, residents were relocated to Level 9. It was policy. Efficient. Necessary for maintaining proper resource allocation.

I'd never watched it happen before.

Had never seen the officer's casual violence. The way the man's daughter - couldn't have been more than eight - started crying and was told to shut up or she'd be separated from her father. The way neighbors watched with dead eyes because they knew better than to intervene.

More families were being extracted. An elderly woman who moved too slowly and was dragged. A young couple with an infant. A teenage boy who asked questions and got hit for it.

All of them legal residents. All of them registered and employed and compliant.

All of them Gamma.

The woman next to me hadn't moved. "This is what happens when you exist while Gamma. Doesn't matter if you're legal. Doesn't matter if you follow every rule. They come anyway."

"Where will they go?" I asked.

"Level 9, if they're lucky. The streets if they're not. Some of them might find the Free Level, if they've heard about it. If they live long enough to get there."

The Free Level.

The place Jax had built because he was trapped and needed his money to mean something. The place that was housing people because no one else would. The place I was supposed to be investigating as a potential threat.

I watched SSS officers - my colleagues, people I'd worked with, people who served the same system I'd served my entire life - beat a woman for asking if she could take her medications. Watched them separate a child from his mother. Watched them do it all with the calm efficiency of people following protocols.

Standard procedure.

Maintaining order.

Doing their jobs.

I felt sick.

---

The raid lasted two hours.

They relocated forty-seven people. Arrested six for "resisting." Put three in medical restraints for "aggressive behavior."

I watched all of it.

Couldn't look away. Couldn't pretend I wasn't seeing what I was seeing.

At one point, a little girl - maybe four years old - dropped her stuffed animal while being rushed out of her home. She tried to go back for it, and an SSS officer kicked it into the gutter. Told her to keep moving or she'd be processed separately from her family.

The girl was crying. The officer looked bored.

I'd been that officer. Maybe not literally - I'd never worked overcrowding relocations - but I'd enforced the same system, believed in the same order, thought I was maintaining stability.

I'd never asked what stability meant for the people being stabilized.

The crowd dispersed slowly after the SSS vehicles left, taking the arrested and the relocated with them. People returned to their homes knowing they might be next. Knowing that being legal and compliant didn't protect them. Knowing that their genetic markers made them targets no matter what they did.

I stood there for a long time after everyone else left, staring at the little girl's stuffed animal in the gutter.

Then I picked it up.

I don't know why. It wouldn't help her. She was gone, relocated to Level 9 with her family, and I had no way to find her. But I couldn't leave it there. Couldn't let it be another piece of trash in a system that treated people like garbage.

I held a stranger's child's toy and felt everything I'd believed start to crack.

---

I didn't go to the medical supply vendor.

Didn't complete my mission. Didn't follow through on what I'd come to Level 8 to do.

Instead I went to a place I'd never thought I'd visit again: SSS Headquarters.

My actual credentials still worked - I was on leave, not terminated. The security systems let me through. The building was familiar in the way nightmares are familiar - you know every corner but wish you didn't.

I found the operations records for the Sector 7 relocation. Pulled the files. Read the protocols.

Everything had been done correctly. By the book. Exactly as the procedures specified.

The overcrowding was real - three percent above recommended occupancy density. The relocations were authorized - signed off by supervisors two levels up. The use of force was within acceptable parameters - no serious injuries documented, no complaints formally filed.

It was all legal.

All proper.

All exactly what the system was designed to do.

I pulled more records. Other relocations. Other sectors. Pattern after pattern of Gammas being moved, arrested, processed. Children separated from families for administrative efficiency. Workers losing jobs because relocation made them late, and being late made them non-compliant, and being non-compliant justified more punishment.

A loop. A cage. A system that ground people down for being born with the wrong DNA.

I'd been enforcing this system my entire career.

I'd thought I was helping.

I'd thought I was maintaining order, protecting people, serving justice.

I'd been crushing children's stuffed animals into gutters and calling it policy.

---

I returned to Level 9 after dark.

The checkpoint guard barely looked at me - another Beta returning from work, nothing suspicious. The familiar rain hit me as I descended, and this time it felt like washing something off. Like I could clean the last eight hours away if the condensation fell hard enough.

It didn't work.

I went to Jax's apartment instead of my own. Used the access codes he'd given me. Found him at his desk, reviewing expansion plans, looking tired and determined and like everything I'd been sent to investigate.

He looked up when I entered. Started to smile. Then saw my expression.

"What happened?"

I set the stuffed animal on his desk. A small gray elephant, worn from being loved, probably the most precious thing that child owned.

"I saw an SSS raid on Level 8," I said. "Relocation operation. Forty-seven people. Six arrested. Three children separated from families."

Jax looked at the stuffed animal, then at me. Waiting.

"It was all legal," I continued. "All by protocol. All exactly what the system is supposed to do. They weren't corrupt officers or bad actors. They were following procedures designed to do exactly what I watched them do."

"And?"

"And I can't unsee it. Can't pretend anymore that the system is just or fair or fixable. Can't lie to myself that I was doing good work enforcing it." I sat down, suddenly exhausted. "I've been complicit in this for eight years. Eight years of enforcing genetic oppression and telling myself it was necessary for order."

Jax was quiet for a long moment. "Why are you telling me this?"

"Because I need you to know. Because I've been lying to you about who I am and why I'm here. Because I can't keep pretending anymore."

"I already knew you were lying."

"Not about this. Not about..." I took a breath. "I'm SSS. Senior Investigator. I was sent here to infiltrate the Free Level, identify funding sources, determine if you're a threat to station security."

I watched his face. Watched the confirmation of what he'd suspected land like a blow. Watched him process that everything between us had started as surveillance.

"So Finn was right," he said quietly. "Mother Sera was right. Everyone was right except me."

"Yes."

"And now you're confessing because you saw a raid that made you feel bad?"

"I'm confessing because I realized I've been serving evil and calling it order. Because you're not the threat - the system I've been defending is the threat. Because I can't report back to my director and pretend the Free Level needs to be shut down when it's the only decent thing happening on this station."

"What are you going to do?"

It was the question I'd been asking myself since I picked up the stuffed animal.

"I don't know. But I know what I'm not going to do. I'm not going to help them crush this. I'm not going to be the informant who destroys what you've built." I met his eyes. "I'm not going to be the person my mother was in the story Mother Sera told you."

He flinched slightly. So he had heard that story. Had been warned.

Had stayed with me anyway.

"I should have told you earlier," I said. "Should have confessed before it got this far. But I was scared of losing you, and I convinced myself I could protect both the investigation and what we had. I was wrong."

"Yes. You were."

The words hurt more than anger would have.

"I understand if you want me gone," I said. "If you can't trust me. If this is unforgivable. I understand all of that."

Jax looked at the stuffed animal again. At this remnant of brutality I'd brought into his apartment like evidence of my own complicity.

"What's her name?" he asked.

"I don't know. I never found out."

"Find her." He said it firmly. "Find the family that was relocated. Give them the elephant. Help them settle in the Free Level if they need it. Do something that matters instead of just feeling guilty."

"That doesn't fix what I did."

"No. But it's a start." He stood, moved to the window, looked out at the undercity. "I knew you were hiding something. Part of me probably knew exactly what. But I wanted you anyway. Wanted to believe you were different, that what we had was real."

"It is real. Whatever started as surveillance, what I feel for you is real."

"Maybe. But it's built on lies. And I don't know if that foundation can hold anything that matters."

The distance between us felt like the scanner's red light. Like all the checkpoints I couldn't pass. Like every barrier the system had built between people who were supposed to be on opposite sides.

"Tell me what to do," I said. "Tell me how to make this right."

He looked at me for a long time. "I don't know if you can. But if you're serious about trying... stop being SSS. Stop serving the system that does what you watched today. Choose a side and stay on it."

"I choose this side. Your side."

"Then prove it. When your director asks for your next report, tell him the truth about what the Free Level is. Tell him it's Gammas realizing they deserve dignity. And when he orders you to shut us down, refuse."

"That would be treason."

"Yes. It would." He turned back from the window. "So I guess the question is whether you're willing to betray the system that betrayed people like that little girl, or whether you're going to keep serving it because it's safer than fighting."

I thought about the raid. About the casual violence and the crying children and the officers who thought they were doing their jobs. About eight years of enforcing those policies and thinking I was helping.

About Jax, who'd been genetically barred from leaving and had built something beautiful from his cage.

About four thousand people living in dignity because someone decided money should mean more than escape.

"I'll refuse," I said. "I'll tell Ashton the Free Level isn't a threat. And when he doesn't believe me, I'll refuse to help him shut it down."

"They'll come for you."

"I know."

"You'll lose everything. Your career, your caste privileges, your family probably."

"I know that too." I stood, moved closer to him. "But I can't keep being the person who kicks stuffed animals into gutters. I can't keep serving this. Even if it costs me everything."

Jax studied me, and I couldn't read his expression.

"I still don't trust you," he said finally. "Maybe I can't ever trust you completely after this. But I believe you're trying. And that's more than I expected."

It wasn't forgiveness.

But it was a chance.

"Thank you," I said.

"Don't thank me. Just do what you said you'd do. Find that family. Write your report. Refuse your director. And maybe someday I'll be able to look at you without wondering if you're still lying."

He left me alone in his apartment with the stuffed elephant and my guilt.

I'd finally told him the truth.

And I'd lost him anyway.

But somewhere on this station, a little girl was missing her toy, and I could at least fix that.

So I got to work.
