# Chapter 19: Report Falsified

The cursor blinked at me like an accusation.

I'd been staring at the blank report template for two hours, my neural interface open to encrypted SSS channels, Director Ashton's latest inquiry waiting for response. Three weeks since my last check-in. He was getting impatient.

*STATUS UPDATE REQUIRED. PROVIDE COMPREHENSIVE ASSESSMENT OF SUBJECT VARRO AND ASSOCIATED OPERATIONS. RECOMMEND ACTION.*

Comprehensive assessment. Recommend action.

I knew what he wanted. Confirmation that Jax Varro was a threat. That the Free Level was cover for something dangerous - weapons stockpiling, revolutionary planning, genetic modification trafficking. Something that justified Station Security moving in with force.

Something that would make me a good investigator again instead of a traitor in love with her target.

I pulled up my notes. Three weeks of documentation. What I'd seen. What I'd learned. What I'd finally understood.

Then I started typing lies.

**CLASSIFIED REPORT**
**SSS INVESTIGATION: LEVEL 9 ANOMALOUS ACTIVITY**
**CASE FILE: UV-9-4521**
**INVESTIGATOR: SR. INV. ELARA QUINN**
**SUBJECT: JAX VARRO (GAMMA CASTE, ID: G-9-847621)**

*EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:*

After three weeks of deep infiltration into Level 9 unauthorized residential developments (collectively designated "Free Level"), I can confirm the following:

Subject Jax Varro is operating a charitable housing and social services network funded by personal wealth obtained through legitimate sales of recovered Earth artifacts. Total expenditure estimated at 2.5 billion credits over 18-month period, supporting approximately 4,500 residents across 19 renovated buildings.

---

I stopped. Read what I'd written. The facts were accurate. The framing was not.

"Charitable housing and social services network."

Not: "Organized community that's teaching Gammas they deserve dignity."

"Legitimate sales of recovered Earth artifacts."

Not: "Fortune he found because the station abandoned an entire level and forgot about the people trapped there."

The truth and the lie lived in the same sentences. I just had to choose which one Ashton would read.

I kept typing.

---

*THREAT ASSESSMENT:*

Subject Varro poses MINIMAL security risk to station operations. Investigation reveals no evidence of:
- Weapons acquisition or stockpiling
- Illegal genetic modification operations
- Organized resistance or revolutionary planning
- Coordination with external hostile entities
- Drift manufacturing or large-scale narcotics distribution

Population movement from Level 8 to Level 9 is voluntary and driven by legitimate grievances regarding:
- Housing cost disparities
- Limited medical access in legal Gamma zones
- Employment instability

Free Level operations appear designed to address these deficiencies through private charity rather than to challenge station authority structures.

---

Every word was technically true.

Every word was a lie by omission.

No mention that the Free Level was showing Gammas they could build something better than what the system offered. No mention that labor songs from a crushed rebellion seventy years ago were being taught to children. No mention that four thousand people choosing community over compliance was the most dangerous thing I'd seen in my career.

No mention that I'd watched my own colleagues beat people for being Gamma and realized which side deserved to be called a threat.

I highlighted the threat assessment. MINIMAL. Made it bold. Made it the thing Ashton would see first.

Then I wrote the section I knew would damn me.

---

*OPERATIONAL ASSESSMENT:*

Subject Varro's primary motivation appears to be personal rather than political. Genetic markers prevent his departure from Level 9 (attempted crossing documented in station records 18 months prior, scanner rejection confirmed). His wealth cannot purchase genetic reclassification. The Free Level represents his response to permanent economic segregation - making Level 9 livable since escape is genetically impossible.

This is not revolutionary ideology. This is wealth without exit options being directed toward community improvement.

Subject exhibits no leadership charisma typical of revolutionary figures. Operations are managed through hired staff (primarily Gamma workers, some Beta administrators). No cult of personality. No political organizing beyond basic community governance. No militia training or security forces beyond standard building protection.

The Free Level is essentially a well-funded charity project run by a trapped man with money to spend. It provides legitimate social services that station authority has failed to provide to Gamma populations. While the population concentration may merit monitoring, it does not constitute an active threat requiring intervention.

---

I read it back. Watched myself transform Jax from someone building a revolution into someone playing at charity. Made him small. Made him safe. Made him something Ashton could dismiss.

It was masterful misdirection.

It was complete betrayal of my oath.

It was the first honest thing I'd done in eight years.

---

*FUNDING SOURCE:*

Confirmed as personal wealth from sale of pre-Collapse Earth currency to private collectors. Source is finite but substantial. At current expenditure rates (60+ million credits monthly), operations sustainable for approximately 3-4 years before resource depletion.

Subject has no external funding, no corporate sponsorship, no off-world connections. This is an individual using found wealth for localized community development.

Long-term sustainability is questionable. When funds exhaust, operations will likely collapse or scale back significantly. No evidence suggests subject has contingency plans or alternative revenue sources.

ASSESSMENT: Self-limiting situation requiring monitoring but not intervention.

---

Self-limiting situation.

That phrase would do it. That phrase would make Ashton think he could wait it out. Let Jax spend his billions. Watch the Free Level bloom and then fade when the money ran out.

It was exactly what Ashton wanted to hear - that the problem would solve itself.

It was exactly wrong. Because what Jax was building wasn't about money. It was about showing Gammas that dignity was possible. And once people learned that lesson, they didn't forget it when the funding dried up.

But I didn't write that.

I wrote what would keep SSS away from the Free Level long enough for Jax to build something they couldn't easily destroy.

I wrote the lie that would save him.

---

*POPULATION ANALYSIS:*

Current Free Level population: approximately 4,500 individuals (4,200 Gamma caste, 300 Beta caste). Migration from Level 8 is voluntary and ongoing. Residents cite:
- Free housing (quality exceeds standard Gamma residential zones)
- Free food services (communal kitchens, daily meals)
- Free medical care (5 clinics, 4 doctors, comprehensive services)
- Fair wage employment opportunities (90+ paid positions at 300% legal minimum wage)
- Community structure and social support

No evidence of coercion, cult recruitment, or manipulation. Residents can leave freely and some have returned to Level 8 legal housing. Population retention is high due to service quality rather than restriction.

ASSESSMENT: Population concentration is consequence of service provision, not ideological organizing. Monitor for changes but do not intervene at current levels.

---

I was describing paradise and calling it unremarkable.

Describing a place where Gammas were treated like humans and suggesting it was just good social services.

Describing the exact thing that terrified the system - people realizing they deserved better - and framing it as charitable do-goodism that would fade when the money did.

My hands were shaking.

I'd written thousands of reports. Assessed hundreds of threats. Built my career on clear-eyed analysis and accurate threat assessment.

This was the best work I'd ever done.

This was treason.

---

*SUBJECT PERSONAL ASSESSMENT:*

Jax Varro (age 27, Gamma caste) presents as intelligent but not ideological. Demonstrates business acumen in property acquisition and operations management. Shows no signs of political radicalization or revolutionary intent.

Subject has personal history of Drift addiction (pharmaceutical grade, currently managed). No other criminal activity detected beyond minor drug distribution in youth (pre-wealth acquisition).

Relationship with residents is professional rather than messianic. He is not positioning himself as leader or savior. Operations are structured as services rather than movement.

Primary character flaw appears to be excessive trust in others and difficulty maintaining professional boundaries. This makes him vulnerable to exploitation but not dangerous to station security.

RECOMMENDATION: Subject Jax Varro is not a security threat. He is a wealthy individual addressing legitimate social needs through private charity. Continued monitoring recommended but intervention unnecessary.

---

"Excessive trust in others and difficulty maintaining professional boundaries."

I'd described his kindness as weakness. His humanity as exploitable flaw.

Made the thing I loved about him sound like a security assessment instead of a revelation.

And the bitter irony - I was the one exploiting his trust. Writing this report that would protect him by minimizing everything that made him dangerous to the system.

Using his vulnerability against the people who wanted to crush him.

Betraying my oath to protect his revolution.

I added the final section.

---

*RECOMMENDATIONS:*

1. Maintain passive monitoring of Free Level operations through existing surveillance infrastructure
2. No active intervention required at this time
3. Reassess if funding sources change or political organizing emerges
4. Continue quarterly reports on population levels and resource consumption
5. Classification: LOW PRIORITY MONITORING, no immediate action required

This investigation has determined that the Free Level represents a localized charitable operation funded by personal wealth, providing legitimate social services to underserved populations. While the scale is unusual, it does not constitute a threat to station security or social order.

Request permission to conclude active investigation and return to regular duty rotation.

---

Request to conclude.

Request to walk away from the best work I'd ever done and return to enforcing the system that kicked children's toys into gutters.

Request to stop watching Jax build something beautiful and go back to my comfortable Alpha apartment and my comfortable Alpha lies about justice.

I couldn't type those words.

So I typed different ones.

---

ADDENDUM (PERSONAL NOTE - CLASSIFIED):

Director Ashton,

I have completed the investigation as requested. My assessment stands as documented above.

However, I feel obligated to note: in three weeks of observation, I have seen more effective social services provision, community development, and genuine public safety improvement than in eight years of SSS operations.

The Free Level is what station authority should have built decades ago. Instead, we abandoned Level 9, forgot about the Gamma populations, and let them survive in condemned infrastructure while we enforced genetic apartheid from comfortable offices.

Jax Varro is not a threat. He's an indictment. He's proof that one person with resources and conscience can do more for Gammas than the entire station government has done in seventy years.

If we shut this down, we're not preventing revolution. We're preventing people from eating. From getting medical care. From living with basic dignity.

I recommend we leave it alone. Not because it's not dangerous - it is. It's dangerous because it's working. Because it's showing Gammas they deserve better. Because once people learn they're human, they stop accepting being treated as livestock.

But that's not a reason to crush it. That's a reason to learn from it.

Respectfully submitted,
SR. INV. ELARA QUINN

I read the addendum three times.

Then I deleted it.

Replaced it with professional boilerplate about investigation timeline and resource expenditure.

The truth wouldn't save anyone. The lie might.

I encrypted the report. Prepared it for transmission.

My finger hovered over the send command.

This was it. The moment I became something other than an SSS investigator. The moment I chose Jax and the Free Level over duty and order and everything I'd been raised to believe.

The moment I became a traitor.

I thought about the little girl's stuffed elephant. About finding her family in a Free Level building two days ago and watching her mother cry when I handed it back. About the girl hugging the elephant and looking at me like I'd given her the universe instead of just a toy.

I thought about Jax holding me despite knowing what I was. Giving me a chance to prove I could choose the right side.

I thought about eight years of serving evil and calling it law.

I transmitted the report.

---

Ashton's response came six hours later.

*REPORT RECEIVED AND REVIEWED. CONCUR WITH ASSESSMENT. INVESTIGATION SUSPENDED. FREE LEVEL DESIGNATED LOW-PRIORITY MONITORING. RECOMMEND RETURN TO HEADQUARTERS FOR REASSIGNMENT AND DEBRIEFING. EXCELLENT WORK, INVESTIGATOR.*

Excellent work.

He believed me. Believed that Jax was harmless and the Free Level was self-limiting charity that would fade when the money ran out.

He was suspending active investigation.

I'd done it. I'd protected the Free Level. Protected Jax. Protected four thousand people who just wanted to live with dignity.

By lying to my director. By falsifying an official report. By committing treason against the system I'd served my entire career.

I should have felt guilty.

Instead I felt light.

---

I found Jax on the roof of Building 47 that night.

He was standing at the edge, looking out over the Free Level. Nineteen buildings lit up in the darkness. Four thousand people living in the community he'd built from rage and money and the desperate need for his cage to mean something.

"I sent the report," I said.

He didn't turn around. "And?"

"I told Ashton you're not a threat. That the Free Level is just well-funded charity. That it's self-limiting and will fade when your money runs out. That you're not dangerous."

"Did he believe you?"

"Yes. He's suspending active investigation. Designating you low-priority monitoring. Calling me back to headquarters."

"So you protected us."

"By lying to my director. By falsifying an official report. By committing treason." I moved to stand beside him. "I can't go back to SSS. Once they realize what I've done - and they will realize eventually - I'll be arrested. Tried. Probably executed for betraying Alpha trust."

"Then don't go back."

"Where else would I go?"

He looked at me finally. "Here. Stay here. Help build this instead of enforcing the system that wants to destroy it."

"I'm not Gamma. I'm not even really Beta. I'm Alpha caste who temporarily modified her genetic signature. Eventually someone will notice."

"So permanently modify it. Dr. Yin can do it. It's illegal and dangerous and will mark you as fugitive for life, but you're already committed to that path. Might as well make it official."

"You're asking me to give up everything. My caste, my career, my family, my entire life."

"I'm asking you to choose the right side and stay on it. You already made the choice when you sent that report. Now you just have to live with the consequences."

I thought about going back to headquarters. About pretending I was still the loyal investigator. About living in comfort while knowing what it cost to maintain that comfort.

About kicking stuffed animals into gutters and calling it policy.

"I'll stay," I said. "I'll help build this. And when they come - because they will come eventually - I'll fight with you instead of against you."

"Even though it means losing everything?"

"Especially because it means losing everything. Because the things I'd be losing are built on other people's suffering. And I'm done pretending that's acceptable."

Jax was quiet for a long moment. "I still don't completely trust you."

"I know."

"But I believe you're trying."

"I am. And I'll keep trying until you either trust me or tell me to leave."

He took my hand. "Then welcome to the Free Level, Elara Quinn. Or whoever you decide to become now that you're not SSS anymore."

"I don't know who that is yet."

"You'll figure it out. We all do, eventually. Down here where the system forgot about us, you can be whoever you choose to be instead of whoever they made you."

We stood on the roof holding hands, watching the rain fall on the city we'd both betrayed our worlds to protect.

I'd filed my last report as an SSS investigator.

I'd crossed the line from enforcer to resister.

And somewhere in the levels above, Director Ashton was reading my lies and believing them.

The Free Level was safe.

For now.

The rain kept falling, but it felt different this time.

Like washing something away instead of just being wet.

Like the beginning of something instead of the end.

I was a traitor now.

Good.

The system deserved to be betrayed.
