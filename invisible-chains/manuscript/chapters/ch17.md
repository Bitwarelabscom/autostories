# Chapter 17: Finn's Suspicion

Finn found me in the old casino that had become our planning center, reviewing expansion proposals with Zara.

"We need to talk," they said. "Alone."

Zara looked between us, read the tension, and gathered her papers. "I'll give you two some space. Jax, we can review these later."

When she left, Finn closed the door with more force than necessary.

"You're sleeping with her," they said. Not a question.

I set down the proposal I'd been reading. "That's my business, not yours."

"It's my business when you're making decisions with parts of your anatomy that don't include your brain." Finn crossed their arms. "She's not who she says she is."

"I know."

"You know?" Their voice went flat. "You know and you're with her anyway?"

I stood, moved to the window that looked out over Sector 4. The Free Level spread below - buildings I'd bought, people I'd housed, a community I'd built. And somewhere in it, Elara was probably working in the kitchen or asking her careful questions or being exactly what I wanted despite knowing better.

"She's hiding something," I said. "I'm aware of that. Mother Sera warned me, you warned me, my own instincts warned me. I know she's not a Beta worker fleeing gambling debts."

"Then why are you with her?"

"Because for the first time in my life, someone makes me feel like I'm more than just a Gamma trying to justify my existence. Because she looks at me and doesn't see a genetic designation or a reformed dealer or a charity project. She sees me." I turned from the window. "And maybe that's stupid. Maybe I'm being used. But I don't care."

"You will care when she betrays you."

"If she betrays me."

"*When*, Jax. Not if. When." Finn moved closer, voice urgent. "I've been around enough con artists and undercover cops and people playing games to recognize the pattern. She asks specific questions. She watches everything. She moves like someone trained for violence. And she's getting close to you to gather information."

"About what? My brilliant master plan to house people and feed them? My secret plot to provide medical care?" I laughed, bitter. "What information could she possibly want that's worth infiltrating the undercity?"

"Maybe someone up there finally noticed four thousand Gammas organizing into a community. Maybe someone wants to know if it's a threat. Maybe she's here to determine if we need to be crushed before we get stronger."

The words hit harder than I wanted to admit. Because it made sense. Because the Free Level had attracted too much attention, grown too fast, become too visible. Station authority had sent the inquiry notice, held the hearing. Of course they'd follow up with surveillance.

Of course they'd send someone.

"Even if you're right," I said carefully, "what do you want me to do? Throw her out based on suspicion? Everyone in the undercity is hiding something, Finn. That's why they're here."

"I want you to protect yourself. To not hand her everything she needs to destroy what we've built."

"I'm not handing her anything. I'm just... letting her see who I am."

"That's the same thing." Finn's expression softened slightly. "Jax. I've known you for fifteen years. Watched you deal Drift when you were too young to understand addiction. Pulled you out of fights you couldn't win. Stood by you when you tried to escape and couldn't. I've never seen you like this."

"Like what?"

"Open. Vulnerable. Hoping for something beyond survival." They paused. "It scares me. Because when you fall, you fall hard, and the impact is going to destroy you."

I thought about Elara's mouth on mine. About her admitting she was falling for me too. About the way she looked at me like I was someone worth knowing instead of someone worth pitying.

"Maybe it's worth the risk."

"Or maybe you're so desperate not to be alone that you'll take connection from someone lying to you rather than no connection at all."

The accusation stung because it was partly true. I'd been alone for so long - surrounded by people I was helping but not connected to any of them. The Free Level was my purpose, my meaning, but it wasn't companionship. It wasn't someone seeing me as a person instead of a symbol.

Elara saw me. Even if she was lying about everything else, that part felt real.

"I'll be careful," I said. "I'll watch what I tell her. I'll keep my guard up."

"Will you? Or will you keep falling until you can't see the ground anymore?"

"Why do you care so much?"

The question came out sharper than I intended. Finn flinched slightly, and I saw something flicker across their face before they controlled it.

"Because someone has to," they said. "Because you're so busy saving everyone else that you don't save yourself. Because..." They stopped, looked away. "Because you matter to me, and I can't watch you get destroyed by someone who's using you."

"Finn—"

"Forget it." They moved toward the door. "Do what you want. Fall for the suspicious Beta who asks too many questions. But when it blows up in your face, don't say I didn't warn you."

They left before I could respond.

I stood alone in the empty casino, surrounded by plans for expansion I wasn't sure mattered anymore, and wondered if Finn was right.

If I was so desperate for connection that I'd accept lies over loneliness.

I found Mother Sera in her apartment that evening.

She was cooking something that smelled like memories - herbs and spices I couldn't place but that reminded me of childhood, of safety, of times before I understood what my DNA meant.

"You're here about the Beta woman," she said without turning around.

"Her name is Elara."

"Her name is probably not Elara." Mother Sera stirred whatever was in her pot. "Sit down. Tell me what you're doing with her."

I sat in the chair by her window, looked out over the sector she'd watched for forty years. "I don't know what I'm doing. But I can't seem to stop."

"Because she makes you feel something."

"Yes."

"And you think feeling something is worth more than protecting what you've built."

"I think feeling something is what makes building worth it in the first place." I turned from the window. "What's the point of saving everyone if I'm just alone at the end of it?"

Mother Sera was quiet for a long moment, her back to me, focused on cooking. When she spoke, her voice was gentle.

"Seventy years ago, my mother fell in love during the rebellion. A man who'd come from Level 8 saying he wanted to help organize the workers. He was educated, well-spoken, knew all about labor rights and collective action. She thought he was going to save them."

"What happened?"

"He was an informant. Reported every meeting, every plan, every name. When Station Security came to break up the rebellion, they knew exactly who to target. Two hundred people died because my mother trusted someone who made her feel less alone."

I felt cold despite the warm kitchen. "What happened to the informant?"

"Someone killed him before the SSS could extract him. My mother never found out who. She spent the rest of her life wondering if she could have seen it, if there were signs she ignored because she wanted so badly to believe someone like him could care about someone like her."

"You think Elara is an informant."

"I think she's not who she says she is. I think she asks the kinds of questions people ask when they're gathering intelligence. I think she got close to you very quickly for someone who supposedly came here fleeing debts." Mother Sera turned to face me. "But I also think you're going to stay with her regardless of what I say."

"Why do you think that?"

"Because you're lonely. Because you've built something magnificent and have no one to share it with. Because you want so badly to believe you can have both the Free Level and personal happiness that you'll risk one for the other."

She wasn't wrong.

"What would you do?" I asked.

"I'd be careful. I'd watch what I told her. I'd prepare for the betrayal I know is coming." She ladled stew into a bowl, handed it to me. "And I'd probably stay with her anyway, because sometimes the heart wants what it wants even when the head knows better."

"That's not very reassuring advice."

"I'm not here to reassure you. I'm here to tell you the truth." She sat down across from me with her own bowl. "You're building something that threatens the system. They're going to come for you eventually. The only question is whether they'll use her to do it."

I ate the stew without tasting it. Thought about Elara's kiss, her admission that she was falling for me, the way she looked at me like I mattered.

Thought about Finn's warning. Mother Sera's story. The pattern I couldn't ignore even as I desperately wanted to.

"If she is here to gather intelligence," I said slowly, "what can she learn that's dangerous? All our operations are legal. The funding is my own money. We're not plotting rebellion or planning attacks. We're just helping people."

"You're showing Gammas that they deserve dignity. That's more dangerous than any weapon." Mother Sera looked at me with eyes that had seen her mother's rebellion crushed. "The system can survive violence. It can't survive people realizing they're human."

Elara was waiting in my apartment when I got back.

She'd let herself in - I'd given her access codes two days ago, another sign of trust that Finn would tell me was reckless. She was sitting on my couch reading one of my old noir novels, and she looked up when I entered with a smile that made my chest hurt.

"Hey," she said. "You were gone a while."

"Talking to Mother Sera."

"About me?"

"About a lot of things." I sat down next to her, suddenly exhausted. "Everyone thinks I'm making a mistake with you."

Her smile faded. "Are you?"

"I don't know. Probably." I took her hand. "Are you here to hurt me, Elara Frost? Are you gathering information to use against the Free Level?"

She went very still. I watched her face, looking for tells, for the truth beneath whatever answer she'd give me.

"I came here for reasons I can't tell you about," she said finally. "Reasons that seemed important when I arrived. But whatever I was looking for... it's not what I found."

"What did you find?"

"Someone who makes me want to be a better person than I am. Someone who's building something that matters. Someone I'm falling for even though I know I shouldn't."

It wasn't a denial. Wasn't an assurance. It was just another version of truth that left me with more questions.

"Finn says you're going to betray me," I said.

"Finn might be right."

"Then why should I trust you?"

"You shouldn't. But I'm hoping you will anyway. Because I'm trusting you with more than I've trusted anyone in my life." She moved closer. "I'm trusting you with the truth that I'm not who I said I am. That I came here under false pretenses. That everything between us started as something else."

"And now?"

"Now I don't know what it is. But it feels real. And I don't want to lose it."

I should have pushed for more. Should have demanded full honesty. Should have protected myself and the Free Level and the four thousand people depending on me to not be an idiot.

Instead I kissed her.

Because Mother Sera was right - sometimes the heart wants what it wants even when the head knows better.

Because maybe Elara was using me and maybe she wasn't, but right now, in this moment, she felt like the only thing that was mine.

Because I was so tired of being alone that I'd take truth with lies over nothing at all.

We ended up in my bed, and afterward she fell asleep against my chest while I stared at the ceiling and wondered what I was doing.

Finn would say I was being a fool.

Mother Sera would say I was repeating her mother's mistake.

And they'd both be right.

But for tonight, with Elara sleeping in my arms, I didn't care.

Tomorrow I'd worry about betrayal and consequences and whether I was trading the Free Level for connection.

Tonight, I'd just be less alone.

Even if it was temporary.

Even if it was dangerous.

Even if it was doomed.

The rain kept falling outside, and I held onto someone who might be lying to me, and I let myself pretend it was enough.
