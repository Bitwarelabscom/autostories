# Chapter 4: The Vault

The vault was small - maybe three meters by three meters - but it held a fortune.

Not immediately obvious as a fortune. Not to someone who didn't know what they were looking at. Just metal shelving units loaded with plastic storage boxes, the kind designed to survive centuries in controlled environments.

We stepped inside carefully, reverently, like entering a temple.

"What is all this?" Finn asked, their voice echoing slightly in the enclosed space.

I opened the nearest box with hands that wanted to shake.

Inside, wrapped in individual protective sleeves, were thin rectangles of what looked like heavy paper. I pulled one out, holding it up to my light.

It was green and black, covered in intricate designs, with numbers in the corners and a face staring out at me. An old face. A stern face. Someone from Earth, from before the exodus, from when humanity still lived on a single world and thought money could be made of paper.

"Currency," I said, my voice rough. "Physical money. This is... this is from Earth."

Finn took the bill carefully, turning it over. "What's it worth?"

"Face value? Twenty dollars, whatever that meant. Real value?" I looked at the boxes - dozens of them, maybe a hundred, stacked carefully on reinforced shelving. "Collectors pay fortunes for Earth artifacts. Physical currency that survived the exodus? That's been extinct for five hundred years. This isn't just valuable. This is priceless."

I opened another box. Coins this time - metal discs in copper, silver, something that might be gold. Each one stamped with dates and faces and symbols from dead nations. Estados Unidos. United Kingdom. Union Européenne. Names from history books, from before the Collapse, from when Earth still had countries instead of just abandoned cities.

Finn was opening other boxes now, cataloging with the same methodical attention they brought to everything. "This one's different currency. Chinese characters. And this one... I can't even read it. Arabic, maybe?"

"Multiple currencies. Multiple nations. Someone collected all of this, sealed it in a vault in the deep city, and then..." I trailed off, trying to imagine the story. "Then the Sealing happened. Or they died. Or they just forgot. And it's been here for two hundred years."

"Why would someone seal money away? If it was valuable then, why not use it?"

I ran my finger over one of the bills, feeling the texture of real paper. "Maybe they thought they'd need it later. Maybe they were preserving Earth's history. Or maybe they knew physical currency would become extinct and wanted to save examples. Archives for the future."

"Some archive. This is more like a dragon's hoard."

They weren't wrong. I did a quick count - at least eighty boxes of various sizes, each one filled with preserved currency. Without even seeing it all, I knew we were looking at millions in face value. Potentially billions in collector value.

This was freedom. This was escape. This was the answer to every problem we'd ever had.

This was everything.

"We can't take it all," Finn said practically. "Not in one trip. Hell, not in ten trips."

They were right. Each box weighed anywhere from five to twenty pounds. We could carry maybe four boxes between us, and that would be pushing it for the six-hour climb back to Level 9.

"We take samples," I decided. "One box of each major currency type. We verify it's genuine, find a buyer, test the market. Then we come back for more."

"And if someone else finds it while we're gone?"

I looked at the vault door, at Marcus Chen's graffiti marking his two-hundred-day obsession. "No one's found it in two centuries except the old man. We reseal it, obscure the entrance, and move fast. With luck, we'll have most of it moved before anyone knows it exists."

"With luck," Finn repeated skeptically. "Sure. Because we're known for our luck."

We spent the next hour carefully selecting boxes. American dollars - both old designs and newer ones I didn't recognize. Euros in various denominations. Chinese yuan. British pounds. Japanese yen. Russian rubles. A box of just coins, heavy and clinking.

Six boxes total. As much as we could carry safely. A small fortune representing the larger one we were leaving behind.

Before we sealed the vault, I looked back one more time. All that money. All that potential. All those paper ghosts from a dead world.

"Thank you, Marcus Chen," I said quietly. "I'll make this count. I'll make your two hundred days worth something."

Finn helped me reseal the door, using the mechanical pressure system to lock it again. We wedged debris around the entrance, made it look like just another sealed doorway in a city of sealed doorways.

Then we started the climb back.

---

The journey up was harder than the journey down.

Gravity fighting us now, pulling us back toward the deep. The boxes were heavier than they looked, their weight multiplied by hours of climbing. My shoulders burned. My legs shook. Finn didn't complain, but I saw them stumble more than once.

We rested in the abandoned residential area, catching our breath in what had once been someone's living room. I set my boxes down carefully and collapsed against a wall.

"This better be worth it," Finn said.

"It will be."

"You don't know that."

"No. But I choose to believe it." I pulled out one of the bills, studying it in my light. The face staring back at me was labeled "Franklin. " Some important human from Earth's past. Now just ink on paper, worth more dead than he probably ever was alive. "Someone in the upper levels will pay for this. Collectors. Historians. People who want to own a piece of Earth."

"People who'll ask where we got it."

"We say we found it. Scavenging. Which is true."

"They'll want to know where."

"And we'll be appropriately vague. Deep city, sealed vault, can't quite remember the exact location. Happens all the time with scavengers - you find something, you get out, you can't quite retrace your steps in the labyrinth."

Finn nodded slowly. "You've thought about this."

"I think about everything. It's exhausting."

We climbed the rest of the way in focused silence, conserving energy for the last push. When we finally emerged into Level 9 proper, the rain had never looked so beautiful. Cold and dirty and failing, but ours. Safe. Known.

We'd descended into the deep and returned with treasure.

Now we just had to figure out how to turn paper into freedom.

---

Back in my hiding spot, we opened all six boxes and laid out the contents.

Thousands of bills. Hundreds of coins. Paper and metal representing economies that had collapsed, nations that had dissolved, a world that had been abandoned. All of it worthless as actual money - you couldn't buy anything with dollars or euros or yuan. The whole human species used digital credits now, had for centuries.

But as artifacts? As history? As collectibles?

This was worth killing for.

"We need a fence," I said. "Someone who deals with high-value goods. Someone with connections to Alpha collectors."

"You know someone?"

"I know someone who might know someone." I was already scrolling through the black market forums, looking for the right channels. "Give me a few days. I'll find a buyer for a test batch. If it works..."

"If it works, we're rich."

"If it works, we're rich," I agreed.

We sat there surrounded by paper money from a dead world, two Gammas who'd been born to be workers, who'd been genetically designed to stay in our place, who'd found treasure in the abandoned depths and were about to bet everything on it being real.

"Jax?" Finn said quietly.

"Yeah?"

"If this works... what are you going to do?"

I thought about it. About biometric scanners that told me where I belonged. About SSS raids and Drift addiction and a lifetime of being told I was lesser. About freedom I'd never tasted and couldn't even imagine properly.

"I don't know," I admitted. "Escape, maybe. Buy my way to the upper levels somehow. Live like an Alpha. Pretend I'm not Gamma."

"That's not you."

"No. But it could be. With enough money, anything could be."

They didn't answer. Just sat there looking at the money, at the paper dreams, at the possibility of being something other than what we were designed to be.

Outside, the rain kept falling.

And inside, we counted our fortune and hoped it was enough.

Hoped it was real.

Hoped this was the beginning of something better instead of just a different kind of ending.

The boxes sat between us, full of paper from a world we'd never see, worth more than we'd make in ten lifetimes of labor.

All we had to do was sell it without getting killed.

Simple.

If you didn't think about it too hard.

Which I definitely wasn't doing.

Definitely.
