# Chapter 5: Paper Fortune

The vault smelled like history.

Not the romantic kind you read about in books, but the real thing - dust and decay and the ghost of recycled air sealed away for two centuries. The door had taken us three hours to crack, Finn working the old mechanical lock with tools scavenged from a dozen different sources while I stood watch in the darkness of the deep city, listening for sounds that meant we weren't alone.

We weren't supposed to be here. Nobody was. This section had been sealed before the Sealing, back when they were still building the station, back when Saturn's rings were a promise instead of a prison. The vault itself was unmarked, just another door in a corridor of doors, except the dying scavenger had said it was special. Said it was worth dying for.

Looking at what was inside, I was starting to think he'd been right.

"Holy shit," Finn whispered. They'd been quiet for the three days since we'd started this expedition, saving their words, but this broke their silence. "Jax. Tell me you're seeing this too."

I was seeing it. Didn't make it more believable.

The vault was the size of a small room, reinforced walls that had held against time and pressure and the slow decay of everything else down here. Inside, stacked in careful rows on metal shelving, were boxes. Hundreds of boxes. And inside those boxes...

Paper.

Not the synthetic stuff they printed disposable notices on. Real paper. Old paper. Earth paper.

I picked up a stack from the nearest box with hands that wanted to shake. The paper was thick, textured, with intricate designs printed in green and black ink. Numbers in the corners. Symbols. Words in half a dozen languages I didn't recognize. And faces - stern-looking people from a dead world staring out at me across seven centuries.

"Currency," I said, my voice rough. "Physical money. From before."

"Before what?"

"Before everything." I turned one of the bills over in my hands, watching how the old ink caught the light from our portable lamps. "Before the Collapse. Before the exodus. This is Earth money, Finn. Real Earth money."

They moved closer, pulling out another box. This one had coins - metal discs in copper and silver and what might have been gold, each one stamped with dates that made my head spin. 1964. 2003. 2089. The last one before humanity gave up on the homeworld and scattered to the stars.

"How much is here?" Finn asked.

I looked at the shelving. Did rough math that probably would have been easier if I'd had more than street-level education and whatever I'd taught myself from stolen books. "Face value? Maybe... fifty million in old American dollars? Plus whatever those other currencies are worth. Yuan. Euro. Yen. I see at least six different types."

"And what's fifty million old American dollars worth now?"

That was the question, wasn't it? I sat down on the vault floor, my mind racing. The bills felt real in my hands. Heavy with age and history and the weight of a world we'd left behind.

"I don't know," I admitted. "What's the Mona Lisa worth? What's the last copy of a book worth? This isn't about exchange rates, Finn. This is about scarcity."

They looked at me with those sharp eyes that saw too much. "You've been thinking about this."

"I've been thinking about everything." I gestured at the boxes. "Every collector in the Alpha caste knows Earth artifacts are valuable. Original art. Ancient technology. Cultural relics. But physical currency?" I laughed, and it sounded slightly unhinged even to me. "Physical currency is extinct. Digital credits replaced it five hundred years ago. These bills aren't just old, they're unique. There might not be another collection like this anywhere in human space."

"So how much?" Finn pressed.

I met their eyes. "Billions, maybe. If we can find the right buyer. If we can move it without getting killed. If we can convince someone we're not just running a scam."

"Billions." They said it like they were tasting the word. "With a B."

"With a B."

We sat there in the vault, surrounded by the paper ghosts of a dead world's economy, and for the first time in my life I felt something I hadn't felt before. Not hope, exactly. Hope was too fragile for people like us. But possibility. The shape of a future that wasn't just survival.

Finn broke the silence. "We can't tell anyone."

"No one," I agreed. "Not even people we trust."

"We don't trust anyone."

"Exactly." I started carefully repacking the box I'd opened. "We need to be smart about this. One box at a time. Test the market. Find a buyer who won't just take it and kill us."

"You know someone?"

"No. But I know someone who might know someone." I pulled out my neural interface, ancient and glitching, and started scrolling through the black market networks. "There are always rumors on the dark boards. Collectors looking for specific items. Fences who specialize in high-value goods."

It took me two hours of searching through encrypted forums and dead-end leads, cross-referencing names and reputations, filtering out the obvious scams and honeypots. Finn stood watch at the vault door, patient as stone, while I dove deep into the digital underbelly of the station's black market.

Finally, I found it.

The listing was three years old, archived but still accessible: "Seeking pre-Collapse Earth artifacts. Cultural items, art, currency, historical documents. Serious sellers only. Discretion guaranteed. Contact The Collector."

The Collector. No real name. No physical location. Just a reputation that showed up in whispers across the forums - someone with unlimited funds who paid in untraceable credits and never asked questions. Someone who existed in that shadowy space between the castes, dealing with anyone who had something they wanted.

Someone dangerous. But then, we were already dangerous just by having what we had.

I copied the contact information to my neural interface and shut down the search. "I think I found our buyer."

"You think, or you know?"

"In this business? Same thing."

Finn nodded slowly. "So what's the play?"

"We take one box. Just one. American bills only - they're the most recognizable. We contact this Collector, set up a meet in neutral territory, sell them the box as a test run. If it goes well, we move more. If it doesn't..."

"We run like hell and never come back here."

"Exactly."

I selected a box that looked like it held only hundred-dollar bills - the kind I'd seen in old movies, in old books, the kind that probably had the most recognition value. The box weighed maybe ten pounds. Ten pounds of paper that might be worth more than the entire undercity.

We packed it carefully in Finn's waterproof supply bag, hiding it under old food wrappers and broken equipment to make it look like scavenged junk. Then we sealed the vault behind us, obscuring the door with debris, making it look like just another forgotten room in the forgotten city.

The journey back took six hours. We moved through corridors that hadn't seen human traffic in decades, past empty rooms that echoed with the memory of workers who'd thought they were building utopia. The station's rotation had slowed here, gravity fluctuating in ways that made my stomach turn. Finn moved like a ghost, silent and sure, while I tried not to think about all the ways this could go wrong.

We could be robbed. We could be killed. We could be caught by SSS and disappeared into whatever black hole they threw Gammas who stepped too far out of line. The box in Finn's bag felt like it was glowing, like it was sending out a signal that everyone could see: *here, here, they have something valuable, take it, take it, take it*.

But we made it. Through the deep city, through the old maintenance tunnels, back into the inhabited sections of Level 9 where people moved through the perpetual rain and tried not to notice two more scavengers returning from the depths.

We holed up in my squat, door locked, windows covered. I pulled out my interface and started composing the message to The Collector. Every word mattered. Too eager and we'd look desperate. Too casual and we'd look like amateurs.

Finally: *"Have acquired pre-Collapse American currency. Physical bills, mint condition, verified authentic. Interested in establishing business relationship. Can provide sample for verification."*

I stared at the message for ten minutes before sending it. Once it was gone, there was no taking it back. We were committed.

"How long until we hear back?" Finn asked.

"Could be hours. Could be never. Could be SSS breaking down the door if this is a sting."

"Optimistic as always."

"It's kept me alive so far."

Finn pulled out a cigarette - real tobacco, not the synthetic shit, something they'd traded for on the black market - and lit it with shaking hands. "If this works..."

"Don't," I said. "Don't imagine it. Not yet."

"Why not?"

"Because hope hurts more than hopelessness." I leaned back against the wall, feeling the weight of the day in my bones. "The life we have, it's shit, but at least it's predictable. We know how to survive this. But billions? That's a different world. And people like us don't survive in that world, Finn. We're the ones who get eaten by it."

They exhaled smoke toward the ceiling. "So what, we just don't try?"

"No. We try. We try like hell. But we stay smart. We stay paranoid. We remember that everyone who has money wants more of it, and everyone who doesn't have it wants ours."

"Cheerful."

"Realistic."

My neural interface chimed. Both of us froze.

I pulled up the message with a thought. It was from The Collector, response time under fifteen minutes. Either they were very eager or very efficient.

*"Intrigued. Sample verification required. Neutral location: Sector 12, abandoned hotel, room 347. Tomorrow, 23:00 hours. Come alone. Bring sample and scanner to verify age. Any sign of surveillance and deal is terminated."*

I read it twice, looking for the trap. But there wasn't an obvious one. Sector 12 was in the undercity, but in a more trafficked area. Public enough to discourage violence, private enough for discretion. Room 347 could be scoped out beforehand. 23:00 hours gave us time to prepare.

"We're on," I told Finn.

They crushed the cigarette out. "What do you need me to do?"

"Tomorrow night, you're my backup. Not in the room, but close. If anything goes wrong—"

"I get you out."

"You save yourself," I corrected. "You're the only person in this undercity I give a damn about. Don't die for me, Finn."

They smiled that crooked smile. "No promises."

We spent the rest of the night planning, preparing, trying not to think about all the ways this could explode. I barely slept. When I did, I dreamed of paper burning, of green bills turning to ash, of reaching for something valuable only to have it crumble in my hands.

When I woke up, the box was still there. Real. Solid. Impossible.

Tomorrow night, everything would change.

Or I'd be dead.

In the undercity, the odds were about even.
