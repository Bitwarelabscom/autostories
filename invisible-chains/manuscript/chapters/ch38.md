# Chapter 38: Ashton's Paranoia

Director Ashton stood in his office, staring at security feeds, feeling the weight of something he couldn't name.

Something was coming.

He'd tightened security protocols three times in the past week. Random spot checks. Increased surveillance. Double-checked every Alpha with database access.

Nothing. No anomalies. No threats.

But the feeling persisted.

"Director?" Agent Sato entered. "You wanted a report on Quinn?"

"Yes. Status?"

"Still missing. Free Level claims they expelled her after the exposure. Our informants confirm she's not in their territory anymore."

"You believe them?"

Sato hesitated. "I think they believe it. Whether it's true is another question."

Ashton's hands trembled. He steadied them. "And Varro?"

"Quiet. Keeping his head down. The exposure of Quinn seems to have broken something in him. He's using Drift again, according to our sources."

Good. A broken Varro was a contained Varro.

"Maintain surveillance," Ashton ordered. "If Quinn surfaces, I want to know immediately."

After Sato left, Ashton reviewed security protocols again. Database access logs. Maintenance schedules. Personnel files.

Everything looked normal.

So why couldn't he shake this feeling?

His desk comm chimed. Dr. Chen from Genetic Records.

"Director, just confirming my maintenance window tomorrow. Routine database optimization."

"Approved. You've done this before?"

"Every month for three years, sir. Standard protocol."

"Carry on."

Ashton disconnected. Reviewed Chen's file. Exemplary record. Loyal. Risk-averse.

No red flags.

He was being paranoid. The stress of Quinn's betrayal was making him see threats everywhere.

Still. One more security upgrade wouldn't hurt.

He ordered additional AI monitoring on the database systems during Chen's maintenance window. Just in case.

Couldn't be too careful.

Not when everything he'd worked for depended on maintaining the system.

Not when his own genetic secret meant he couldn't afford any exposure.

Tomorrow would be fine.

Just routine maintenance.

Nothing to worry about.

So why did it feel like the calm before a storm?
