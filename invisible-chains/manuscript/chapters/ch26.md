# Chapter 26: False Peace

The last good morning.

That's what Elara would remember it as, later. The last morning when Jax looked at her without betrayal in his eyes. The last time she woke up in their bed, in their life, in the fragile paradise they'd built.

She should have known. Should have listened to her instincts screaming danger. Should have grabbed Jax and run while there was still time.

But she didn't. So she woke up beside him as rain drummed overhead, as morning light filtered through the rust-stained windows, as the Free Level stirred to life around them. Their last peaceful moment, and she didn't even know to savor it.

"Morning," Jax mumbled, pulling her close. He was warm and solid and real, and she memorized the feel of him, though she didn't know why.

"Morning." She kissed him, long and slow. Tried to pour everything into it—all the things she'd never said, never could say.

He pulled back, studied her face. "You're being weird."

"How so?"

"I don't know. Intense. Like you're trying to memorize me."

Too perceptive. Always too perceptive.

"Maybe I am," she said lightly. "You're worth memorizing."

"Flatterer." But he smiled, and God, she loved that smile. Would have done anything to protect it.

Had done everything, and it still wouldn't be enough.

They got up together, dressed in the comfortable silence of two years of mornings. Elara pulled on work clothes—simple, practical, nothing like the tailored suits she used to wear. Jax made tea from the good leaves Finn had scavenged, and they stood together in their small quarters, looking out at the Free Level through the window.

"Beautiful, isn't it?" Jax said. "Even with all the rust and rain, it's beautiful."

It was. The murals on the corridor walls, the gardens growing under salvaged lights, the people moving with purpose instead of defeat. Two years of work, of hope, of believing things could be better.

"Yeah," Elara said. "It is."

"Sometimes I can't believe this is real," Jax admitted. "That we built this. That I have you. That things are actually good."

"They are real," she said, even though her instincts screamed that real was about to shatter. "All of it."

They finished their tea. Jax had morning rounds to make—checking systems, talking to residents, being the leader he'd never meant to become. Elara had a shift at the medical clinic.

At the door, Jax paused. "Tonight, let's do something. Just us. Finn's been asking about inventory runs to Level 7—I'll send them, get us some time alone. We can cook actual food, use the good wine, pretend we're fancy."

"I'd like that." More than he knew. One last night together.

Why was she thinking like that? Like this was ending?

"I love you," Jax said, sudden and fierce. "I need you to know that. Whatever happens, whatever changes, I love you."

The words hit like prophecy. Like he knew, somehow, that change was coming.

"I love you too," she said. "More than anything."

He kissed her again, then left. Elara stood alone in their quarters, heart pounding, feeling like she was standing on the edge of a cliff.

She could still run. Could grab her emergency supplies, slip into the service tunnels, disappear before whatever was coming arrived. She was trained for evasion, knew how to vanish.

But running meant leaving Jax. Leaving the Free Level. Abandoning everything she'd chosen.

And she'd already abandoned everything once—her oath, her service, her old life. She couldn't do it again.

So she stayed. Got ready for her clinic shift. Stepped out into the wet corridors of the Free Level and tried to ignore the feeling that she was walking toward her own execution.

The morning was perfect.

That's what would haunt Jax later—how perfect it had been. How happy everyone looked. How normal everything seemed right up until it all broke.

He made his rounds, checking the water purification system first. Running perfectly. Then the hydroponics—the tomatoes were almost ready for harvest. The market corridor bustled with vendors and early shoppers. People called out greetings as he passed.

"Jax! Got those parts you needed."

"Morning, Varro. Coffee?"

"Hey boss, the new air filters are working great."

Boss. Leader. Protector. Roles he'd never asked for but had grown into anyway.

He stopped by Mother Sera's quarters. She was sitting in her chair, that old notebook of labor songs open on her lap.

"Morning, child," she said.

"You feeling okay? You look tired."

"I'm old. Tired is the default." But she smiled. "Don't fuss. I'm fine for today."

For today. The words held weight he didn't want to examine.

"I'll check on you later," he said.

"You do that."

He continued his rounds, talked with Kalia about kitchen supplies, helped fix a leaking pipe in Block 2, settled a minor dispute about market stall placement. Normal leadership things. Mundane problems with mundane solutions.

At 0745, he was in the community center, helping set up for the morning meal. Two hundred people would eat here today, all fed by the systems he'd put in place. Pride and terror warred in his chest—pride at what they'd built, terror that it couldn't last.

Finn appeared beside him, looking rough. Hangover, probably. They'd been drinking more since their conversation about Elara.

"You okay, friend?" Jax asked.

"Fine. Just tired." Finn wouldn't meet his eyes. "You?"

"Good. Great, actually. Tonight I'm doing something nice for Elara. Want to handle that Level 7 inventory run?"

"Yeah, I can do that." Finn paused. "Jax, listen. Whatever happens, you know I've got your back, right?"

"Of course. Why are you talking like—"

The screens flickered.

Every screen in the Free Level—the old monitors they'd salvaged and repurposed for community announcements, the small displays in living quarters, the large one in the community center—all of them activated simultaneously.

That was weird. They didn't network together like that. Couldn't network together without serious system integration that Jax hadn't authorized.

People looked up from their breakfast, curious but not yet concerned.

Then the image appeared.

A woman's face. Professional photograph, tailored suit, hair perfect, expression serious. Official identification photo with SSS logos in the corner. And beneath it, text in block letters:

SENIOR INVESTIGATOR ELARA QUINN
ALPHA CASTE
STATION SECURITY SERVICES

Jax stared at the screen. That made no sense. Some kind of mistake. Wrong broadcast. This was—

Then the second image appeared.

Elara. His Elara. Caught by a surveillance camera entering Level 9, timestamped eighteen months ago. Then another image, her at the market, laughing with residents. Then another, her and Jax together at the community center, clearly intimate.

And the text:

ATTENTION FREE LEVEL RESIDENTS:
The woman you know as Elara Frost is Senior Investigator Elara Quinn, Alpha Caste, Station Security Services. She has been living among you as part of a surveillance operation for two years. Everything she has told you is a lie. This is your enemy.

The community center went silent.

Jax couldn't breathe. Couldn't think. Couldn't process what he was seeing.

This was wrong. This had to be wrong. Some kind of SSS propaganda, trying to turn them against each other. Elara was Beta. She was a fugitive. She was—

He looked at the identification photo again. Really looked.

The bone structure was the same. The eyes. Remove the makeup, let the hair down, add two years of living rough—

It was her.

"No," he said aloud. "No, this is—"

"Jax." Finn's voice was hollow. "I think it's real."

Around them, the community center erupted. Voices rising, angry and afraid.

"She's SSS?"

"She's been lying this whole time?"

"She's Alpha? Elite?"

"This is a surveillance op?"

"Where is she?"

"Find her!"

The anger built like a wave. Jax stood frozen in the center of it, world tilting, everything he'd believed cracking apart.

Elara. His Elara. SSS Alpha investigator. His enemy, sleeping in his bed, learning their secrets, reporting to—

The medical clinic.

She was at the medical clinic.

Jax ran.
