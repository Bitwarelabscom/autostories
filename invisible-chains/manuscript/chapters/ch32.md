# Chapter 32: The Proposition

They met in the old vault where Jax had found the Earth currency three years ago. Neutral ground. A place that predated Elara, predated the lies, predated everything.

Jax arrived first, sober and raw and ready for a fight.

Elara arrived ten minutes later, limping on her damaged ankle, Mother Sera at her side. Sera gave them one long look, then left them alone in the art deco tomb of the station's better past.

They stood twenty feet apart in the vault's dim light. The walls were beautiful and rusted, elegant decay everywhere. Between them, silence stretched like a wound.

Jax looked at her—really looked, for the first time since the exposure. She was thinner, harder, scarred. The polish was completely gone. Whatever she'd been when she came here, she wasn't that anymore.

"You wanted to talk," he said. Voice flat. "Talk."

Elara swallowed. "Thank you for agreeing to meet me."

"Don't thank me. Sera says you have a plan to break the caste system. I'm here for the plan, not for you."

"I understand." She moved closer, still careful, like approaching a wounded animal. "The genetic database that enforces caste restrictions is housed in SSS headquarters, Level 1. I worked there for six years. I know the security protocols, the shift rotations, the blind spots in surveillance."

"So hack it yourself. Why do you need us?"

"Because I can't get into the building anymore. My clearance was revoked when Ashton exposed me. I'd be arrested on sight." She met his eyes. "But I know someone on the inside. Alpha bureaucrat named Dr. Chen. He has full access to the genetic database. And he has gambling debts that make him desperate."

"You want to blackmail someone into giving us access."

"Not blackmail. Buy. We pay his debts, he lets us into the system for thirty minutes. That's all we need. I've designed a virus that will corrupt the caste markers in the database. Every genetic record randomized. The scanners won't know who's Gamma, who's Alpha, who's anything."

Jax considered that. "System-wide chaos."

"System-wide freedom," she corrected. "Gammas could move to any level. Access any job. The biometric restrictions would be meaningless if the database they're checking against is corrupted."

"And the Authority will just let this happen?"

"No. They'll try to fix it, try to restore order, probably get violent." Elara's voice was steady. "But by the time they could rebuild the database from backups—if they even have complete backups—thousands of Gammas would have already moved up. Already integrated. Already proven they're human, not subhuman. You can't put that genie back in the bottle."

It was brilliant. Insane, dangerous, probably suicidal. But brilliant.

"Why?" Jax asked. "Why would you do this? You're Alpha. You benefit from the system."

"Not anymore. Ashton made sure of that." She took a breath. "But even if I could go back, I wouldn't. Because I've seen what this system does. I've lived with the people it crushes. I've seen children punished for being born Gamma. I've seen brilliant minds wasted because genetics determined they could only do manual labor. I've seen—" Her voice cracked. "I've seen you, trapped in paradise you built but can never leave. And I have the power to change that. So I will."

"Noble speech," Jax said coldly. "But I don't trust you."

"I know."

"You lied to me every day for two years."

"I know."

"You came here to investigate me, gather evidence against me, probably send me to prison or worse."

"I did. And then I fell in love with you and everything changed." She met his anger with painful honesty. "I know you don't believe that. I know you think it was all performance. But Jax, I gave up everything for you. My career, my family, my entire life. I filed false reports for two years, committed treason against the SSS, chose to stay and be hunted rather than go back. That's not performance. That's love."

"Or you're just a really committed liar."

"Maybe." She smiled sadly. "Maybe I am. Maybe you'll never know what was real. But Jax, this—" She pulled out a data chip. "—this is real. This is the virus. This is the plan. This is everything I know about SSS security turned against them. Use it. Use me. Get what you need and walk away. I don't care. Just let me help free the people I learned to love."

Jax stared at the data chip. At her. At the impossible choice.

"If we do this," he said slowly, "people will die. Authority won't let the caste system fall without a fight. There will be violence. Blood. War, maybe."

"I know."

"And you're willing to risk that? Risk all those lives?"

"I'm willing to fight for those lives," Elara said. "Living under oppression is also death. Slower. Quieter. But just as final. At least this way we die fighting. At least this way we choose."

"You don't get to say 'we.' You're not Gamma. You're not oppressed."

"You're right. I'm not. I'm privileged Alpha who could walk away anytime." She straightened. "But I'm choosing not to. I'm choosing to fight with you, for you, alongside you. Not because I deserve to. Because it's right."

Jax wanted to refuse. Wanted to tell her to go to hell, take her plan and shove it, live with her guilt alone.

But he'd built the Free Level on one principle: survival wasn't enough. People deserved better. Deserved dignity, freedom, choice.

And this plan—this insane, dangerous, probably suicidal plan—offered that. Offered real freedom, not just paradise in a cage.

"I need guarantees," he said. "I need to know you won't betray us mid-operation. That this isn't some elaborate SSS trap."

"I can't give you guarantees. Can't prove my loyalty with words. Only with actions." She held out the data chip. "But I'll go first into any danger. Take every risk before I ask you to risk anything. Put my life on the line first, every time. If it's a trap, I die first. That's my guarantee."

Jax took the chip. Felt its weight.

Freedom. Or death. Or both.

"I'll need to see the full plan," he said. "Every detail. Every contingency. And I'll need my people to vet it, find the flaws, stress-test every assumption."

"Of course."

"And during this operation, we're not—" He struggled with the words. "We're not together. We're not lovers. We're not even friends. We're allies of convenience. You do your job, I do mine, we don't talk about anything else."

Pain crossed her face. "I understand."

"Good." He pocketed the chip. "Mother Sera will set up a meeting. You'll present the full plan to me, Finn, and Sera. If they approve, we move forward. If not, you walk away and we never speak again."

"Okay."

They stood in silence for a moment. So much to say, too much to say, nothing left to say.

"Jax?" Elara's voice was small. "For what it's worth—I am sorry. For lying. For hurting you. For not being brave enough to tell you the truth when I had the chance. You deserved better than what I gave you."

"Yeah," he said. "I did."

He turned to leave. Made it three steps before stopping.

"Elara." She looked up, hope and fear warring on her face. "If we do this, if we pull this off—it doesn't mean I forgive you. Doesn't mean we go back to what we were. It just means I'm willing to use your skills and your guilt to free my people. Nothing more."

"I know," she whispered.

"But—" The words were pulled from somewhere deep. "But if you die doing this, if you sacrifice yourself to make it work—I need you to know that I did love you. That part was real, from my side. Whatever you felt, whatever you were performing, my love was real."

Tears slid down her face. "Mine was too. Is too. Even knowing you'll never believe it."

"Probably not," he agreed. "But you asked what was real. So I'm telling you. My love was real."

He left before he could say anything else. Before he could do something stupid like forgive her or hold her or believe they could salvage anything from the wreckage.

Behind him, in the beautiful ruins of the old vault, Elara stood alone and cried.

For what they'd had. For what she'd destroyed. For what they'd never have again.

But also for what they might build together, even broken, even separate.

Freedom.

One real thing from all the lies.

She'd take it.

She'd burn herself to nothing to give it to him.

And maybe that would be enough.

Not forgiveness. Not love. But purpose.

Sometimes purpose was all you had.

Sometimes it was enough to keep fighting.

Outside the vault, Mother Sera waited. She saw Jax emerge first, jaw set, eyes distant. Then Elara, limping and crying but somehow taller. Stronger.

"It's happening?" Sera asked.

"It's happening," Jax confirmed.

The revolution had begun.

Small, fragile, maybe doomed.

But begun.

And sometimes beginning was enough.
