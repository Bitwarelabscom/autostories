# Chapter 14: The Influx

The checkpoint guard looked at the line forming on the Level 8 side and called for backup.

I was on the Level 9 side, watching through the gate as forty people waited to cross down into the undercity. Forty Gammas with bags and children and the nervous energy of people making a choice they couldn't take back.

They were coming to the Free Level.

The phenomenon had started three weeks ago - one or two people a day trickling down from Level 8's legal Gamma zones. Workers who'd heard about free housing, medical care, fair wages. At first it was just the desperate: people who'd lost their jobs, families who couldn't afford rent, the injured and the sick.

Then it was the hopeful.

Then it was everyone.

The guard looked overwhelmed. "I don't understand. You have legal housing up here. Jobs. You're registered. Why would you move to Level 9?"

A woman near the front of the line answered. "Because down there, we're people. Up here, we're just livestock that happens to be useful."

The guard had no response to that.

I watched them come through the checkpoint one by one - the scanners reading their DNA, confirming they were Gamma, flagging them as transitioning from Level 8 to Level 9. A downward movement the system hadn't been designed to track because who moved down voluntarily?

Zara met each arrival with a clipboard and a calm demeanor that somehow made chaos feel organized. She'd set up a processing system at the checkpoint - intake forms, housing assignments, orientation schedules. The Free Level had grown beyond improvisation.

"Welcome to Level 9," she said to each person. "Welcome to the Free Level."

By the end of the day, we'd processed sixty-three new arrivals.

By the end of the week, it was four hundred.

I called an emergency staff meeting in Building 47's common area.

Finn, Zara, Dr. Yin, Dr. Okafor, Kara, Kovak, Iris, and a dozen others who'd become essential to operations. People who'd started as employees and become something more - architects of a movement we hadn't meant to build.

"We have a problem," I said. "Or maybe an opportunity. Hard to tell which."

Zara pulled up the numbers on the wall screen. "Four hundred new arrivals this week. Waiting list is now at three thousand. We have one hundred sixty-five units occupied, plus people doubling up, tripling up in some cases. We're housing maybe seven hundred fifty people total. We have space for maybe two hundred more if we pack them in."

"And they keep coming," Finn added. "Word on Level 8 is that the Free Level is real, it's working, and life down here is better than life up there. People are choosing to leave legal housing to come to the undercity. That's... unprecedented."

Dr. Okafor spoke up. "The clinics are overwhelmed. We're seeing a hundred patients a day now across all locations. People who've been putting off medical care for years because they couldn't afford it. We need more doctors, more equipment, more everything."

Kara raised her hand. "Maintenance is barely keeping up. Every building is being pushed past capacity. We're going to have infrastructure failures if we don't expand soon."

I looked at the numbers, at the faces of people who'd come to the Free Level looking for answers I didn't have.

"How much would it cost to buy and renovate ten more buildings?" I asked Zara.

She didn't even blink. "A billion credits. Maybe more depending on condition and size. Plus operating costs would jump to sixty million a month minimum."

"I have the money."

"For now. But at this growth rate, you'll burn through everything in three years. Maybe four."

"Then we have three years to figure out sustainability." I stood. "Buy the buildings. Hire more staff. Double our capacity as fast as we can. These people are choosing to come here - choosing us over the system that's failed them their whole lives. We don't turn them away."

Finn looked at me with something between admiration and concern. "You're building a city within a city."

"I'm building what we need. If that's a city, fine."

---

The next four months were controlled chaos.

I bought twelve buildings in rapid succession - Sectors 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11. Spent 1.2 billion on acquisition and renovation. Hired sixty more staff. Opened three more medical clinics. Expanded the kitchens to feed thousands.

The population boomed.

By month two, we had two thousand residents. By month three, thirty-five hundred. By month four, we stopped counting individuals and started counting families. The Free Level had become a community, a culture, a place people belonged.

The labor songs started organically. Someone who'd been given Mother Sera's copied notebook taught one to their children. Those children sang it while playing. Other kids learned it. Adults started humming it while working in the communal kitchens.

*We built these walls with broken hands
We lit these lights with borrowed time
They call us beasts, they call us less
But we are human, we are here*

I heard it everywhere. In the hallways, in the clinics, in the common areas where people gathered. A song about resistance, about humanity, about refusing to be what the system said they were.

Culture was spreading as fast as hope.

And hope was spreading faster than I could build.

The notice came through official channels five months into the influx.

Station Authority, Office of Level Management. A formal communication transmitted to my neural interface with enough legal weight to make it impossible to ignore.

*NOTICE OF INQUIRY
Regarding: Unauthorized population concentration, Level 9
Concerned party: J. Varro, Undercity Development Projects*

*Station records indicate significant population movement from Level 8 to Level 9 over the past five months. Approximately 4,500 registered Gamma-class residents have voluntarily relocated to undocumented housing in sectors previously classified as abandoned.*

*This movement constitutes a potential safety concern and may indicate:
- Unregistered residential developments bypassing building codes
- Tax evasion through unreported property transactions
- Public health risks from overcrowding
- Security concerns regarding concentrated Gamma populations*

*You are required to appear before the Level Management Board within 30 days to provide documentation of all property holdings, residential populations, and operational structures. Failure to comply will result in immediate investigation and potential criminal charges.*

I read it three times, my hands steady despite the adrenaline.

They'd noticed.

Of course they'd noticed. Four thousand people don't disappear from legal housing without someone asking questions.

Finn read over my shoulder. "Shit."

"Yeah."

"What are you going to do?"

I thought about Mother Sera asking if I'd fight or fold when they came. Thought about the labor songs echoing through buildings I'd bought with money that was supposed to be worthless. Thought about four thousand people who'd chosen to come here, chosen community over the scraps the system offered.

"I'm going to the hearing," I said. "And I'm going to tell them exactly what I'm doing."

"They'll shut you down."

"Maybe. Or maybe they'll realize shutting down four thousand people who've found hope is harder than they think."

---

I spent the next two weeks preparing.

Documentation of every property purchase. Building inspection reports showing we'd exceeded code requirements. Financial records proving everything was paid for legitimately. Medical statistics showing our clinics had reduced preventable deaths by forty percent. Employment records for ninety staff members making fair wages. Testimonials from residents about what the Free Level meant to them.

I built a case that we were doing everything right.

But I knew documentation wouldn't matter.

This wasn't about building codes or taxes. This was about four thousand Gammas choosing to live in community, choosing dignity, choosing to believe they deserved better.

That was dangerous.

That was what they really wanted to stop.

---

The meeting with Mother Sera happened the night before the hearing.

I found her in her apartment, sitting by her window as always, watching over Sector 9 like a sentinel.

"They're going to try to shut us down," I said.

"I know. Station authority doesn't like it when Gammas get organized."

"I'm going to fight them."

"I know that too." She turned from the window. "Question is whether you're willing to lose."

"I can't lose. Four thousand people depend on this."

"Then you need to understand something." She stood, moved to face me directly. "When you walk into that hearing tomorrow, you're not just defending buildings and budgets. You're defending the idea that Gammas deserve dignity. That we're human. That the system is wrong."

"I know."

"Do you? Because once you say that out loud to their faces, there's no taking it back. You'll be marked. Tracked. They'll look for any excuse to bring you down."

I thought about the scanner's red light. About being called livestock. About trying to buy my way out of my DNA and learning that some cages can't be opened with money.

"I've been marked my whole life," I said. "At least now I'm marked for something that matters."

Mother Sera smiled. "Then you're ready. Go tell them what we've built. Tell them why it matters. And when they threaten you, remember - four thousand people chose to be here. They can't disappear us all."

"What if they try?"

"Then we'll sing so loud they can't ignore us."

---

I left her apartment with a certainty I hadn't felt before.

The Free Level wasn't just buildings. It was people choosing community. It was culture emerging from resistance. It was the labor songs carrying forward from a rebellion seventy years dead. It was proof that Gammas could build something beautiful when given the chance.

And I'd defend it.

Whatever came next.

I walked through the undercity - my city now, in a way - and saw lights in windows that had been dark for decades. Heard children laughing in hallways that had been silent. Smelled cooking from communal kitchens feeding thousands.

This was real.

This mattered.

And tomorrow, I'd make them see it.

The hearing was set for 14:00, Level 5 Administrative Complex. I'd never been to Level 5. Didn't have clearance. They'd had to issue me a temporary pass just to appear before them.

The irony wasn't lost on me.

I went back to Building 47, to my office, and worked until dawn preparing my testimony.

Not about codes and taxes.

About humanity.

About what four thousand people had chosen when they chose to come here.

About what the Free Level really meant.

Finn found me as the sun simulation brightened - artificial dawn in a place that had never seen real sun.

"Ready?" they asked.

"No. But I'm going anyway."

"Want backup?"

I thought about that. About walking into Level 5 alone versus bringing support. About whether showing up with other Gammas would help or make things worse.

"Come with me," I said. "And bring Zara. They need to see we're organized. Professional. Not some undercity gang."

"We'll be there."

The hearing was twelve hours away.

Twelve hours to save what we'd built.

Or watch it burn.

The labor songs were still echoing in my head.

*We are human, we are here.*

Tomorrow, I'd make them hear it too.
