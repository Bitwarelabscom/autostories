# Chapter 42: The First Free Steps

Jax stood on Level 5 and couldn't stop shaking.

Not from fear. From disbelief.

He'd walked from Level 9 to Level 5. Through gates that had rejected him his entire life. Past scanners that couldn't identify his caste. Into spaces that had been forbidden.

Free. He was actually free.

Around him, other Gammas experienced the same revelation. Touching clean walls. Breathing filtered air. Seeing sky-sim screens showing blue and clouds instead of rust and condensation.

"Is this real?" an old man whispered.

"It's real," Jax said. "We're really here."

They'd paid for it already. Seven Gammas dead at the Level 3 checkpoint. Dozens wounded. And more violence coming.

But they were here. They'd broken through.

Finn found him, bleeding from a cut on their arm. "We're holding Level 4. But SSS is bringing in reinforcements. This is going to get worse before it gets better."

"I know." Jax looked at the Gammas around him—scared, hopeful, determined. "Get everyone organized. We're not giving back what we've taken. We hold these levels or die trying."

Mother Sera arrived, breathing labored from the climb. "Child, you need to speak to them. They're looking for leadership."

Jax climbed onto a platform, looked at the hundreds of Gammas gathered on Level 5.

"We're free!" he shouted. Cheers erupted. "The database is corrupted! The system that marked us as lesser is broken! We are not subhuman! We never were! They lied to us for generations, but we're taking back what's ours!"

More cheers. Fists raised. Hope and rage combined.

"They will try to push us back down. They will use violence to restore the old order. But we don't go back! We fight! We claim our humanity! We show them we are human, we matter, we exist!"

The crowd roared approval.

The revolution had truly begun.

# Chapter 43: Mass Movement

Station-wide, the exodus continued.

On Level 8, ten thousand Gammas moved up simultaneously. Overwhelming checkpoints through sheer numbers.

On Level 6, Beta workers joined the protest. "We're tired of serving Alphas too!"

On Level 4, Alpha families barricaded themselves in luxury apartments, terrified of the rising tide.

The social order was collapsing.

Ashton watched from his office, seeing his worst nightmare unfold. "How many have moved up?"

"Estimated twenty thousand Gammas above their designated levels," Agent Reeves reported. "And growing."

"Can we push them back?"

"Not without massive civilian casualties, sir. And some of our own forces are... hesitating."

Ashton's hands shook. "Hesitating?"

"Several Beta officers have refused orders to fire on Gammas. They're saying the people have a right to move freely."

The system was fracturing. Not just genetically but ideologically. People were choosing sides.

"Declare martial law," Ashton ordered. "Full lockdown. Anyone moving between levels is shot on sight."

"Sir, that's—"

"Do it!"

The order went out. But half the security forces ignored it. Some actively defied it.

The station was splitting apart.

Gamma versus Alpha. Beta caught in between. And the question everyone faced: which side of history would they be on?

# Chapter 44: Authority Lockdown

The crackdown was brutal.

SSS deployed heavy weapons. Sealed Level 3 completely. Anyone trying to pass: shot.

Fifteen more dead. Then twenty. Then fifty.

Jax watched from Level 5, sickened. This was the cost. The blood price of freedom.

"We need to organize better," Elara said. "Right now we're just a mob. We need structure. Leadership. Strategy."

"I'm a drug dealer, not a general."

"Then learn fast. Because people are dying and they're looking to you to save them."

Finn coordinated defensive positions. Barricades on Level 4. Chokepoints fortified. They were preparing for siege.

Mother Sera set up medical stations. Treating wounded. Comforting the dying.

And Jax tried to become a leader worthy of the revolution he'd started.

# Chapter 45: Ashton's Desperation

Ashton hadn't slept in two days.

The database couldn't be restored. Quinn's virus had been too thorough.

The Gamma uprising was spreading. More Betas joining them. Even some Alphas sympathizing.

His authority was eroding.

And his hands wouldn't stop shaking. The genetic instability his grandfather had passed down was worsening under stress.

"Director," Sato entered. "The Council is requesting your presence."

The Alpha Council. His bosses. The people he'd spent his life proving himself to.

They'd want answers. Solutions. Scapegoats.

He straightened his uniform, hid his trembling hands, and went to face judgment.

The Council chamber was cold. Seven Alpha elders stared at him with contempt.

"Director Ashton. You allowed this catastrophe."

"I'm containing it—"

"You're losing control! Gammas are occupying five levels! The social order is collapsing!"

"The database was sabotaged by my former agent—"

"Your agent who you failed to stop. Your agent who lived among terrorists for two years while reporting to you. Your failure, Director."

Ashton felt the trap closing. They were going to make him the scapegoat.

"Give me one week," he said. "I will crush this uprising and restore order."

"How?"

"By any means necessary. Full military response. No restraint. We end this now."

The Council deliberated. Then: "One week, Director. Succeed or face execution for incompetence."

Ashton left, hands shaking worse than ever.

One week to save his life.

One week to destroy the revolution.

He'd do whatever it took.

Even genocide.
