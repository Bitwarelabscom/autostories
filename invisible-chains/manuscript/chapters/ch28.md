# Chapter 28: Hunted

Three days in the forgotten dark.

Elara had found an abandoned maintenance room deep in the decommissioned sections of Level 9, a place even the scavengers hadn't touched in decades. The door still locked from the inside. There was a rusted cot, a broken sink, shadows that moved when the failing lights flickered.

It was perfect. It was hell.

Her hands had stopped bleeding but were infected—she could see the red lines spreading from the cuts. Her ankle was purple and swollen, probably fractured. She had no medical supplies, no clean water, no food. Just the emergency pack she'd hidden months ago in case her cover was blown. Rations for three days, water purification tablets, basic first aid.

The pack was almost empty now.

She sat on the cot in the dark, listening to footsteps pass in distant corridors. Searching for her. Always searching.

On day one, she'd heard them calling her name. Not with affection—with rage.

"Quinn! We know you're down here!"

"Come out, Alpha bitch!"

"Should've known better than to trust one of them!"

She'd stayed silent, hidden, terrified. The people hunting her weren't SSS agents. They were Kalia and Marcus and dozens of others she'd worked beside, treated in the clinic, considered friends.

Friends who now wanted her dead.

On day two, she'd tried to move to a different hiding spot, closer to Level 8 where she might find an escape route. She'd made it two corridors before running into a search party—eight residents with makeshift weapons, faces hard with betrayal.

She'd run, her injured ankle screaming. They'd pursued. She'd barely lost them in the maze of service tunnels, and only because she'd accessed an old maintenance shaft too narrow for most people to follow.

Now, day three, she was out of food and nearly out of water. Her infections were getting worse. The pain in her ankle was constant, nauseating.

And she could hear them outside, still searching.

She needed to leave this hiding spot. Needed to find food, water, medical supplies. Needed to reach Level 8, where at least she'd have a chance of navigating to the upper levels where her Alpha status might protect her.

Might. Or she'd be arrested by SSS for desertion and betrayal.

Ashton wouldn't be forgiving.

A noise outside her door. Footsteps. Close.

Elara grabbed the small knife from her emergency pack—barely more than a box cutter, but it was all she had. She pressed herself into the corner shadows, hardly breathing.

The footsteps paused outside her door.

"Checked this room yesterday," a man's voice said. Sounded like Finn. "Empty."

"Check again." A woman. Didn't recognize her. "She could've doubled back."

The door handle rattled. Locked. They moved on.

Elara waited ten minutes before allowing herself to breathe normally again. Finn was hunting her too. Of course Finn was hunting her. She'd hurt Jax, and Finn would never forgive that.

Nobody would forgive that.

She'd spent two years becoming part of their community, and one broadcast had erased it all. Now she was the enemy. The outsider. The liar who'd infiltrated and betrayed them.

The truth was more complicated, but complicated truths didn't matter when people felt betrayed.

She waited until the footsteps faded completely, then forced herself to move. She couldn't stay here. Had to keep going.

Getting to her feet sent white-hot pain through her ankle. She bit down on her sleeve to keep from crying out. Breathed through it. Stood.

The infection was spreading. She could feel it—fever building, chills despite the humid heat. If she didn't get antibiotics soon, sepsis would set in. And down here, sepsis meant death.

She unlocked the door carefully, listened. Silence. She slipped out into the corridor, using the wall for support, trying not to put weight on her bad ankle.

The forgotten sections of Level 9 were like a tomb. Old machinery loomed in the darkness, rusted and strange. Water dripped constantly. The lighting barely worked. This was where the station had died, decades ago, sealed off and abandoned.

Now it was her home. Her prison.

She limped through the darkness, heading toward a section she remembered from her early intelligence gathering—an old supply depot that might still have salvageable materials. It was risky, moving around in daylight hours. But she was desperate.

The depot was three corridors away. She made it halfway before hearing voices ahead.

"—can't have gone far, not with that ankle—"

"—probably hiding in one of the old rooms—"

"—find her, Jax wants to talk to her himself—"

Elara's heart stopped. Jax wanted to talk to her. That could mean anything. Confrontation. Closure. Violence.

She couldn't face him. Not like this. Not bleeding and broken and desperate.

She backed into a side passage, pressed against the wall. The search party passed within ten feet of her, four people with flashlights and anger.

When they were gone, she tried to continue toward the depot. But her ankle gave out. She went down hard, biting back a scream.

Couldn't get up. The pain was too much.

She lay on the wet floor, rain dripping on her from above, and wondered if this was how it ended. Dying alone in the dark, hunted by the people she'd tried to save, abandoned by the organization she'd served.

Fitting, maybe. Poetic justice for a liar and a traitor.

Her vision swam. Fever or despair or both.

Then hands grabbed her.

She tried to fight, tried to scream, but she was too weak. The hands pulled her up, dragged her into shadows. She expected violence, expected—

"Quiet," a voice hissed. Old. Female. Mother Sera.

Elara stared. Sera looked back with ancient, unreadable eyes.

"You look like hell, child," Sera said. "Can you walk?"

"I—why are you—"

"Can you walk? Yes or no."

"No. Ankle's fractured. Infected."

Sera muttered something under her breath. "Fool girl. Come on. I've got a place. But we need to move before the next search party comes through."

She helped Elara up, surprisingly strong for her age. They moved together, Sera supporting her, through passages Elara didn't recognize. Down a maintenance shaft, through a hidden door, into a small room that smelled like herbs and old paper.

Sera's secret room. Elara had never known it existed.

"Sit," Sera ordered. Elara sat. Sera pulled out medical supplies—real supplies, not scavenged trash. Started cleaning Elara's infected hands with sharp-smelling antiseptic.

"Why are you helping me?" Elara asked.

"Because you're an idiot who's going to die of sepsis if someone doesn't intervene." Sera wrapped her hands with clean bandages. "And because we need to talk."

"The others—"

"Don't know I'm here. Think I'm resting. Old woman privilege." She moved to Elara's ankle, cut away the makeshift wrap. Studied the swelling. "This needs proper medical care. Can't give you that here. But I can stabilize it, give you antibiotics, buy you time."

"Why?" Elara's voice cracked. "I lied to all of you. I'm SSS. I'm Alpha. I'm everything you should hate."

Sera looked up from the ankle. "That's one way to see it. Here's another: you came here as an enemy and chose to become a friend. You used your skills and knowledge to protect us instead of destroy us. You loved Jax and this community enough to betray everything you knew." She paused. "That true?"

"Yes."

"Then you're not what you were. You're what you chose to become." Sera wrapped the ankle carefully. "Problem is, nobody else sees it that way yet. They just see the betrayal."

"Jax sees the betrayal."

"Jax is hurt. Badly hurt. Man loved you completely, and you lied to him completely. That's going to take time to heal. If it heals."

Elara felt tears coming. Tried to stop them. Failed. "I fucked up. I should have told him from the beginning, or at least before—before Ashton could."

"Yes," Sera said bluntly. "You should have. But you didn't, and now you live with that." She injected something into Elara's arm—antibiotics, hopefully. "Question is, what are you going to do about it?"

"What can I do? They want me gone. Dead, probably. And they're right to want that. I'm the enemy."

"Are you?" Sera finished with the bandages, sat back. "Because the enemy doesn't spend two years building community. The enemy doesn't file false reports to protect people. The enemy doesn't fall in love with a Gamma and throw away their entire life."

"I lied—"

"You did. And that was wrong. But wrong things can be done for right reasons." Sera fixed her with that knowing gaze. "So I'll ask again: what are you going to do? You going to hide down here until you die? Going to run back to the SSS and beg forgiveness? Or you going to find a way to make this right?"

"I don't know how to make this right."

"Then you better figure it out." Sera stood, handed her a canteen of water and a ration bar. "Because Jax and this community need you, whether they know it yet or not."

"They hate me."

"They're hurt. There's a difference." Sera moved toward the door. "Stay here tonight. Rest. Heal. Think. Tomorrow, we'll talk about what comes next."

"Mother Sera—"

The old woman looked back.

"Thank you," Elara said. "For not giving up on me."

"Didn't say I wasn't giving up on you. Said I was giving you a chance. What you do with it is up to you." She left, locking the door behind her.

Elara sat alone in the hidden room, hands and ankle properly bandaged for the first time in three days. She drank the water slowly, ate half the ration bar, felt the antibiotics starting to work.

Sera was right. She had to figure out how to make this right.

But how did you earn forgiveness from people you'd betrayed completely?

How did you prove love to someone who didn't know what was real about you?

How did you become trustworthy when you'd proven yourself a liar?

Elara didn't have answers. But for the first time in three days, she had hope.

Small, fragile, maybe foolish.

But hope nonetheless.
