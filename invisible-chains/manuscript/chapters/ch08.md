# Chapter 8: The Scanner

The documents looked perfect.

I held them up to the light in my apartment, examining the Beta caste marker that gleamed with holographic security features. The identity broker had done good work - better than I'd expected for three million credits total. Employment records for a logistics coordinator position at a Level 7 shipping company. Residential authorization for a one-bedroom unit in Sector 3. Medical history, education credentials, family registry.

Everything a Beta would have.

Everything I needed to be someone else.

The name on the credentials was Marcus Webb. I said it out loud a few times, trying it on. "Marcus Webb. I'm Marcus Webb, logistics coordinator." The words felt strange in my mouth, like a language I'd learned but never spoken.

The pickup had gone smoothly. A courier in a neutral zone, three blocks from the Sector 4 checkpoint. I'd handed over the million in physical scrip - bills I'd acquired specifically for the transaction, untraceable - and received a sealed envelope in return. Professional. Anonymous. Exactly what three million credits should buy.

That had been six hours ago. Since then, I'd been staring at the credentials, reading and rereading the fabricated biography of Marcus Webb, trying to convince myself I could pull this off.

I hadn't taken any Drift. Needed to be sharp for this. Needed my hands steady and my head clear. The withdrawal made everything feel sharp-edged and too bright, but that was manageable. Fear was a better drug than Drift anyway. Fear kept you alive.

My neural implant showed 03:47. Third shift at the Level 8 checkpoint, the understaffed one I'd read about. Two guards instead of six. Fewer witnesses. Better odds.

I dressed in the Beta-class clothing I'd purchased - nice pants, a pressed shirt, a jacket that looked professional without being too expensive. Nothing flashy. Marcus Webb was middle management, someone who blended in.

I practiced walking like a Beta. Shoulders back, head up, the confident stride of someone who'd never been told they were less than human. It felt like theater. Like I was performing a role I'd seen from a distance but never understood from the inside.

The credentials went into my inner pocket. My real identification chip - the one that screamed "Gamma" to every scanner on the station - I left on my kitchen counter.

This was it.

One checkpoint. One scanner. One chance.

I left my apartment without looking back.

---

The route to the Level 8 checkpoint took me through the western corridors of Sector 4, past the residential blocks where undercity families lived in converted storage units and repurposed cargo bays. The eternal rain dripped from overhead pipes. Neon signs flickered in languages that had died on Earth centuries ago. People huddled in doorways, getting high or getting by or trying to forget which was which.

I'd walked these corridors a thousand times. Knew every turn, every shortcut, every place where the ceiling leaked or the floor buckled. This was home, no matter how much I hated it.

In an hour, it would be behind me forever.

The checkpoint appeared ahead like a gateway to another world. The architecture changed at the border - the art deco decay of Level 9 giving way to the cleaner, more maintained infrastructure of Level 8. The difference was stark. Level 8 had working lights. Dry floors. Paint that wasn't peeling off in toxic strips.

Even Level 8, the lowest level that station authority actually acknowledged, was paradise compared to the undercity.

The scanner arch stood at the border like a judge. Six feet of black metal studded with sensors, flanked by guard stations that were currently manned by exactly two SSS officers in body armor.

Both looked bored.

I approached with Marcus Webb's confident stride, my false identity ready, my real heart hammering so hard I was sure the scanner would detect it.

"Morning," I said to the nearest guard. Casual. Like I did this every day.

She barely looked up from her display. "Credentials."

I handed her the documents. She ran them through her verification scanner - a quick check of the holographic markers and embedded chips. The scanner beeped green.

"Purpose of crossing?" she asked.

"Heading home. Work in Level 7, fell asleep at a friend's place in 8." I made myself smile. "You know how it is."

She didn't care how it was. "Go through the arch. Stand still for full scan."

This was it.

I walked to the scanner, every nerve in my body screaming. The arch loomed over me, sensors active, reading everything about me down to my genetic code.

I thought about Level 7. The parks. The trees. The life I was going to have.

I thought about Finn warning me this would break something in me.

I thought about Dr. Yin explaining that scanners read DNA, not documents.

I stepped into the arch.

For three seconds, nothing happened. The sensors did their work in silence, invisible readers parsing my genetic code, comparing it to the vast database of registered station residents.

Looking for Marcus Webb.

Finding Jax Varro instead.

The alarm wasn't loud. That was the worst part. It was soft, almost polite - a gentle chime that might as well have been a klaxon.

Then the light turned red.

"Step back," the guard said, her voice suddenly sharp. Her hand moved to her pulse weapon.

"There must be some mistake," I said. Marcus Webb would say that. Marcus Webb would be confused, not terrified. "My credentials are-"

"GENETIC MISMATCH," the scanner announced in that sweet mechanical voice that made everything sound reasonable. "CREDENTIALS: WEBB, MARCUS - BETA CASTE. ACTUAL DNA: VARRO, JAX - GAMMA CASTE. IDENTITY FRAUD DETECTED."

The second guard was moving now, circling around to my flank. Both had weapons drawn.

"On your knees," the first guard ordered. "Hands behind your head. Now."

I ran.

Not toward the checkpoint - that was suicide. Back the way I'd come, into the undercity, into the labyrinth I knew better than anyone. I heard pulse fire behind me, felt the ozone burn as shots passed close enough to singe my jacket.

The undercity swallowed me like it always did.

I ran through corridors I'd walked a thousand times, took turns without thinking, muscle memory guiding me through the maze. Behind me, boots pounded on metal grating. The guards were following, but they didn't know these corridors. They didn't know which turns led to dead ends and which led to escape routes.

This was my home. My cage. My territory.

I lost them somewhere in Sector 6, in the old industrial zone where the machinery hulks provided cover and the ceiling was low enough that anyone taller than a Gamma had to duck. My lungs burned. My legs shook. My heart felt like it was trying to break through my ribs.

I collapsed against a wall in a forgotten corridor, gasping for air that tasted like rust and desperation.

The documents were still in my pocket. Marcus Webb's perfect credentials, worth three million credits, absolutely useless.

Dr. Yin had told me. The scanners read DNA, not documents. No amount of paperwork changes biology.

I'd known.

Deep down, past all the hope and the Drift and the desperate fantasy, I'd known.

And I'd tried anyway.

"FRAUD DETECTED," the scanner had said. Like I was trying to steal something that belonged to someone else. Like Marcus Webb was real and I was the imposter.

Maybe I was.

I pulled out the credentials, looked at the face on the ID that was my face but wasn't, the name that was mine for three million credits but would never actually be mine.

Marcus Webb. Beta-caste logistics coordinator. Authorized to live on Level 7, to walk through parks with real trees, to exist as a person instead of a genetic mistake.

I tore the documents in half. Then in half again. Again and again until they were confetti in my shaking hands.

Three million credits worth of lies scattered across the floor of a forgotten corridor.

The money couldn't buy it.

Nothing could buy it.

I'd known that. But knowing something and accepting it are different animals.

---

I made it back to my apartment as dawn light started filtering through the undercity - not real dawn, just the brightening of emergency lights that marked the passage of time in a place where the sun never reached.

My neural implant was full of alerts. Warrants issued for identity fraud. Security notices flagged on my real genetic profile. I was officially a wanted criminal now, though the charges would probably be dropped after a token fine. Gammas tried to sneak into upper levels all the time. The system just sent them back down and made them pay for the trouble.

The money.

I had four hundred million credits and couldn't buy my way past a genetic scanner.

I stood in my expensive apartment with my expensive furniture and my expensive pharmaceutical-grade Drift, and I understood finally what Finn had been trying to tell me.

A different cage with better furniture.

That's all this was. All it would ever be.

I pulled out a vial of Drift. Then another. Then a third.

Took the first hit standing up. The second sitting down. The third lying on my expensive real-leather couch, staring at my ceiling that didn't leak, in my apartment I'd bought with money that didn't matter.

The Drift made everything soft and distant.

But it didn't make the scanner's voice go away.

GENETIC MISMATCH.

GAMMA CASTE.

FRAUD DETECTED.

The words echoed in my head like a verdict. Like a diagnosis. Like the truth I'd been running from my entire life.

You can't buy your way out of your DNA.

The money meant nothing.

The fancy apartment meant nothing.

Marcus Webb meant nothing.

I was Jax Varro, Gamma-caste, genetically inferior, permanently barred from the life I'd glimpsed through those perfect fake credentials.

I'd known it before I tried.

But I'd had to try anyway.

Had to know for sure that hope was poison.

Now I did.

I took another hit of Drift and let the world dissolve into chemical forgiveness.

Outside my real windows in my expensive cage, the rain kept falling on the undercity.

On the only place I'd ever be allowed to exist.

On home.

Finn found me sixteen hours later, still on the couch, surrounded by empty Drift vials.

"They said someone tried to cross the checkpoint with fake Beta credentials," they said quietly. "I figured it was you."

I didn't answer.

"You okay?"

"No."

They sat on the floor next to the couch. Didn't try to make me sit up or stop using. Just sat there.

"I'm sorry," they said.

"You told me. You warned me."

"I know. But I'm still sorry it happened."

We sat in silence for a long time. The Drift was wearing off, leaving me hollowed out and sick.

"What do I do now?" I asked the ceiling.

"I don't know. But you've got four hundred million credits and nowhere to go. Eventually you'll have to figure out what that means."

"It means I'm rich and trapped."

"Yeah." Finn's voice was gentle. "It does."

They stayed with me for the rest of the night, keeping watch while I cycled through rage and grief and numbness. Didn't try to fix anything. Didn't tell me it would be okay.

Just sat there, solid and real, while everything else fell apart.

The scanner's voice kept playing in my head.

GAMMA CASTE.

No amount of money could change it.

I was beginning to understand what that meant.
