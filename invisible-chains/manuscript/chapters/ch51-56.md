# Chapter 51: The Investigation

While preparing the broadcast, Jax dug deeper into Ashton's history.

The files Elara had recovered were fragmentary but damning:

Medical records showing genetic instability. Hand tremors. Markers inconsistent with pure Alpha genetics.

A sealed document from 80 years ago: "Subject G-7743 (Designation: Ashton, Marcus Sr.) underwent illegal modification procedure. Genetic markers successfully masked. Subject presents as Alpha. Recommend destruction of all records."

But someone had kept a backup. Hidden deep in old archives.

Ashton's grandfather had been Gamma. Modified to pass as Alpha. The family secret that would destroy Marcus Ashton's entire life.

"This is it," Jax said. "This is how we break him."

They compiled evidence. Medical scans. Documents. Testimony from retired geneticists who remembered the procedure.

The broadcast was ready.

# Chapter 52: The Exposure

The broadcast went station-wide at noon.

Every screen. Every terminal. Impossible to ignore.

Elara's voice: "Citizens of Meridian Station. For generations, you've been told that genetic caste is absolute. That Alphas are pure, Gammas are lesser, and this is natural order. But the man enforcing this system is himself a lie."

Images appeared. Documents. Medical scans.

"Director Marcus Ashton. Head of Station Security Services. Enforcer of genetic purity. His grandfather was Gamma. Illegally modified to pass as Alpha. Every generation since has been living a lie."

Ashton's official photo beside his grandfather's Gamma registration. The family resemblance undeniable.

"The man who tells you Gammas are subhuman is himself of Gamma descent. The man who enforces purity is impure. The entire system is built on lies and hypocrisy. Join us in tearing it down."

The broadcast ended. The damage was done.

Ashton watched the broadcast from his office, feeling his world collapse.

His deepest secret. The thing he'd spent his life hiding. Exposed to everyone.

His comm exploded with calls. The Council demanding explanations. Agents questioning orders. The station turning against him.

His hands shook uncontrollably. Genetic instability—the proof of his Gamma heritage—visible for all to see.

Agent Sato entered. "Sir, the Council has summoned you immediately."

"I know."

"Sir, for what it's worth—I don't care about your genetics. You've been a good commander."

"Not good enough." Ashton stood. "They'll execute me for this. For lying about my bloodline. For bringing shame to the Alpha caste."

"Then don't go. Join the revolution. Fight with them instead of against them."

Ashton laughed bitterly. "After everything I've done to them? They'd never accept me."

"Maybe not. But you'd die fighting for something real instead of dying to protect a lie."

Sato left him alone with the choice.

Ashton looked at his trembling hands. Proof of the Gamma blood he'd spent his life denying.

What was he fighting for anymore? A system that would kill him for being born wrong? A Council that had never accepted him as one of them?

Or could he find redemption in tearing it all down?

# Chapter 53: Ashton Broken

Ashton didn't go to the Council. He fled.

Down to Level 6. Into hiding. A broken man watching his life's work crumble.

The SSS fractured without his leadership. Half the forces defected to the revolution. The rest fought on, leaderless and desperate.

Authority control collapsed. Level 3 fell to revolutionary forces. Then Level 2.

Only Level 1 remained in Authority hands. The Alpha Council barricaded themselves in their towers, surrounded by the few loyalists who remained.

The revolution had won. Mostly.

Now came the hard part: rebuilding.

# Chapter 54: The Final Offensive

But the Alpha Council refused to surrender.

"We will not yield to Gamma terrorists. We will fight to the last!"

They launched a desperate counterattack. Everything they had. Full military deployment.

Target: the revolutionary base in the old vault on Level 9. Where the leadership gathered.

Bombers. Heavy weapons. Intent to decapitate the revolution by killing its leaders.

The alarm sounded. "Incoming airstrike!"

"Evacuate!" Jax shouted. "Everyone out!"

The base erupted in chaos. People running. Grabbing wounded. Fleeing.

But Mother Sera moved too slowly. Her failing lungs, her age, couldn't keep up.

Finn ran back for her. "Sera! Come on!"

"Child, leave me. Save yourself."

"Not happening!" Finn lifted her, started carrying her out.

They made it fifty feet before the bombs fell.

# Chapter 55: Defending Home

The explosion tore through the old vault.

Finn threw themselves over Sera, taking the shrapnel meant for her.

When the dust settled, Finn was bleeding but alive. Sera was beneath them, also alive but barely breathing.

Jax and Elara pulled them from the rubble.

"Sera!" Jax cradled the old woman. "Stay with us!"

She smiled weakly. "Did well, child. So proud. You became... what I hoped..."

"Don't talk. Save your strength."

"No strength left. But that's okay. I saw... freedom. Saw my people... rise up. That's enough."

# Chapter 56: Mother Sera Falls

Sera died in Jax's arms as the bombs fell around them.

The revolution's matriarch. The keeper of memory. The heart of resistance.

Gone.

Finn held her other hand, crying. "I'm sorry. I should have moved faster."

"You gave her a few more minutes," Elara said gently. "That's all any of us get. A few more minutes."

They carried her body from the ruins. Hundreds of revolutionaries gathered, seeing their fallen leader.

Someone began singing. One of the old labor songs from Sera's notebook. The song of defiance. The song of hope.

Others joined. Hundreds of voices. Thousands. Singing for Sera. Singing for freedom. Singing because they were still alive and still fighting.

Jax stood before them, grief and rage mixing. "They killed her because she dared to teach us we were human! They killed her because she remembered when we tried to be free before! They killed her because she was everything they feared—a Gamma who refused to accept her place!"

The crowd roared.

"We don't just fight for freedom anymore! We fight for Sera! We fight for every person they've killed! We fight until the system that murdered her is destroyed completely!"

The grief turned to determination. Sera's death didn't break the revolution.

It galvanized it.

The final offensive began.

Revolutionary forces pushed toward Level 1. Toward the Alpha Council. Toward ending this once and for all.

Sera had given them everything. Now they'd finish what she'd started.

No more half measures. No more compromise.

Freedom or death. And Sera had chosen death so they could have freedom.

They wouldn't waste her sacrifice.

They'd burn it all down.

For her. For themselves. For every Gamma who'd died believing they deserved it.

The songs of labor became songs of war.

And the revolution, baptized in Sera's blood, became unstoppable.
