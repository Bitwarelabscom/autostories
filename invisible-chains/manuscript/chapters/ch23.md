# Chapter 23: Mother Sera's Counsel

Mother Sera's quarters smelled like old books and medicinal herbs, scents that shouldn't exist in the rusted undercity but somehow did. Jax sat on the worn chair across from her, accepting the cup of real tea she'd poured from a battered ceramic pot. Two years of prosperity, and some small luxuries had filtered down even here.

"You look troubled, child," Sera said, settling into her own chair with the careful movements of age. Her breathing rattled slightly—the enhanced lung capacity her Gamma modifications had given her was failing after eight decades of use. "More troubled than usual."

"Is it that obvious?"

"To anyone who knows how to look." She sipped her tea, weathered dark hands steady around the cup. "You've been walking the perimeter three times a day instead of once. You check the water systems hourly. You barely sleep."

Jax looked into his tea rather than meet her eyes. "Things are good. Too good. I keep waiting for it to fall apart."

"Wise man waits for the storm," Sera said. "Fool thinks sunshine lasts forever."

"So you think something's coming too."

"I know it is." She set her cup down, fixed him with eyes that had seen five decades of station cruelty. "The powerful don't let the powerless build paradise, Jax. Not without a fight."

The rain drummed on the metal roof overhead, that perpetual percussion. Jax had come to Sera's quarters seeking... what? Reassurance? Permission to stop being paranoid? Instead, she was confirming his worst fears.

"How long?" he asked.

"I don't know. But soon." She leaned forward. "You've built something beautiful here. Somethin' that shows people they don't have to accept what they've been told they are. That's dangerous to folks who benefit from everyone believin' the lie."

"The caste system."

"The whole damn thing. Genetics determining worth. Gammas knowing their place. It all requires us to believe we deserve to be down here." Her voice carried the rhythm of old labor songs. "But you showed people different. Clean water. Real food. Medicine. Dignity. You showed them what they could have, what they deserve. And now four hundred people know the system's a choice, not a law of nature."

"I just wanted to make it better," Jax said. "I wasn't trying to start a revolution."

"Sometimes revolution starts whether you mean it to or not." Sera's expression softened. "I'm not blaming you, child. I'm preparing you. When they come—and they will come—you need to know what you're defending. Not just buildings and systems. But the idea that we're human. That we matter."

Jax thought about the murals painted on corridor walls. The gardens growing food that nobody was stealing because everyone had enough. The children who smiled instead of cowering.

"I can't lose this," he said quietly. "I can't go back to how it was before."

"Then you need to decide how far you'll go to keep it." Sera reached across and gripped his hand with surprising strength. "I've lived a long time, Jax. Lived through the worst of what this station does to people like us. And I've learned something: systems of power don't fall on their own. They have to be pushed. You built something that threatens their power just by existing. They will try to destroy it. The question is, will you fight back?"

"That's not—I'm not a revolutionary. I just sell... I used to sell Drift. I found money and spent it. I'm not a leader."

"You're wrong about that," she said firmly. "You've been leading for two years. Four hundred people follow your vision. They trust you. And when the trouble comes, they'll look to you to tell them what to do."

Jax felt the weight of that responsibility pressing down. He'd never asked for it. Never wanted to be responsible for anything larger than himself and Finn.

"What if I make the wrong choice?" he asked. "What if I get people killed?"

"Then you'll carry that." Sera's voice was gentle but unflinching. "That's what leadership means. But making no choice, letting them tear this down without a fight—that's a choice too. And you'll carry that just the same."

She released his hand, sat back. For a moment they just listened to the rain.

"I had a daughter once," Sera said eventually. "Long time ago. She died in the recycling plant, machinery malfunction. Station Authority said it was operator error. Said Gammas are clumsy, should've been more careful. Gave me a hundred credits compensation and told me to move on."

Jax had heard the story before, but he let her tell it again. Sera needed to tell it.

"She was sixteen years old. Brilliant child. Could've been anything, in a different world. In this world, she got fed into recycling machinery and the people responsible never even learned her name." Sera's eyes were distant. "That was forty years ago. I've been waiting forty years for something to change. For someone to stand up and say this isn't right, we don't have to accept this."

"And you think I'm that someone?"

"I think you already are, child. You just don't know it yet." She smiled, sad and knowing. "The Free Level already changed things. Can't go back from that. The only question is whether you'll stand with it when the storm hits, or whether you'll run."

Jax thought about Elara sleeping in their bed, exhausted from another long day at the clinic. Thought about Finn organizing the market vendors, that rare smile when something went right. Thought about Kalia and the hundreds of others who'd found hope here.

"I won't run," he said. "Whatever comes, I'll face it."

"Good." Sera nodded slowly. "Because I'm an old woman, and I won't live to see the end of this. But you—you might. And I need to know someone will carry it through."

"Don't talk like that."

"I'm being realistic, not morbid. My lungs are failing, Jax. I got maybe a few years left, if I'm lucky." She said it matter-of-factly. "But that's enough. Enough to see the fight start. Maybe that's all I was meant for—to keep the memory alive long enough to pass it to someone who can use it."

"Memory of what?"

"That we were people first. Before the modifications, before the castes, before all of it. We were people. And we can be again." She reached for a battered notebook on the shelf beside her, handed it to him. "These are the old songs. Labor songs from before I was born, from when the first modified workers tried to organize. The station thought they killed all record of the resistance. But songs survive. Memory survives."

Jax opened the notebook, saw handwritten lyrics in Sera's careful script. Songs about solidarity, about refusing to be broken, about hope in darkness.

"Why are you giving me this now?"

"Because you'll need them," she said simply. "When the fight starts, people need something to believe in. Something to remind them why they're fighting. These songs did that once. They can do it again."

"You really think it's coming to a fight."

"I know it is." Sera's certainty was absolute. "And here's something else you need to know: when it comes, some of the people you trust will surprise you. Some will stand with you who you never expected. Some will betray you who you thought were loyal. That's how it always goes."

Jax thought about Elara. About the secrets she kept. About Finn's warning that she was hiding something.

"If someone betrayed me," he said slowly, "but they'd done good work, helped people—could that be forgiven?"

Sera studied him. "You asking about someone specific?"

"Hypothetically."

"Mm-hmm." She didn't buy it but didn't push. "Depends on the betrayal. Depends on their reasons. Depends on what they do after to make it right." She paused. "But I'll tell you this: people are complicated, Jax. Good people do bad things. Bad people do good things. The question isn't whether someone's perfect. It's whether they're trying to be better."

"And if their trying isn't enough? If the damage is done?"

"Then you decide if you can live with the damage, or if the wound's too deep." Sera's voice was soft. "But whatever you decide, you decide it yourself. Don't let anger make the choice for you. Anger's useful for the fight, but it's a terrible counselor for what comes after."

Jax nodded, clutching the song notebook. They sat in comfortable silence for a while, two people who understood each other without needing many words.

"Thank you," he finally said. "For everything. For believing in this."

"Thank you for giving me something to believe in again." She smiled. "Now get out of here. You got a community to protect and a woman who worries when you're gone too long."

Jax stood, moved toward the door, then turned back. "Sera? When it comes. The trouble. You really think we can win?"

She considered that. "Win is a complicated word. But can we make them pay for what they've taken from us? Can we show them we're not nothing, we're not nobody? Can we go down fighting instead of kneeling?" Her eyes blazed with sudden fire. "Yes, child. That we can do."

Jax left her quarters and walked back through the Free Level, the notebook pressed against his chest like a talisman. The rain fell. People moved through the corridors, going about their lives.

Beautiful, fragile, temporary lives.

Sera was right. The storm was coming. He could feel it in his bones now, that electric tension before lightning strikes.

The only question was whether they'd survive it.

And whether survival would be enough.
