# Chapter 5: Distributed Truth

Lira stopped trusting the ansible station's systems three days after Mikhael's memorial.

If the guild could modify ansible messages in transit, they could monitor her personal files. Could track her investigation. Could see every piece of evidence she'd compiled showing their systematic deception.

Probably already had.

So she distributed the truth.

At 0300 hours, floating in her quarters while the station slept, Lira began fracturing her evidence across systems the guild either didn't monitor or couldn't access without triggering alerts that would reveal their surveillance.

First: the station's environmental control database. Buried in maintenance logs and atmospheric composition readings, encoded in the periodic fluctuations of oxygen percentages that no one ever examined closely, she hid fragments of ansible timestamp data. Anyone looking at the logs would see routine climate control. Anyone who knew what pattern to search for would find evidence of forty years of systematic modifications.

Second: the navigation beacon network. Kepler-442's system had thirty-seven nav beacons for guiding incoming ships. Each beacon logged position data, velocity corrections, course recommendations. Lira embedded pieces of her investigation in the beacon communication protocols—modified preambles that looked like standard transmission overhead but actually carried encrypted evidence of message fabrication.

Third: the most dangerous and most secure: she drafted an ansible transmission addressed to Lira Voss at Kepler-442, and set it to auto-send from the ansible network itself through a delayed routing protocol. A message from herself to herself, passed through the ansible relay at Tau Ceti, bounced to New Singapore, routed back to Kepler-442. Thirty days of network travel. By the time it arrived, if she'd been disappeared or silenced, the message would prove someone had been investigating. Would prove the evidence existed.

A dead woman's switch, built from quantum entanglement and time delays.

Fourth and most crucial: she prepared physical data cores. Old-fashioned information storage that couldn't be remotely modified or deleted. She copied everything—ansible logs, Zara's research, the 2840 pattern shift, Earth's sealed priority message metadata, war casualty correlations, Ryn's authorization codes. Complete evidence archive on three separate data cores, each encrypted with different protocols.

One core she hid in the ansible station's maintenance tunnels, sealed in a junction box marked as containing toxic coolant systems. No one would look there without specific reason.

One core she gave to Darin during routine shift change. Told him it was personal files—family photos, private journals—and asked him to keep it safe in case something happened to her. He'd agreed without question, concerned by her request but trusting her completely.

The third core she kept, concealed in her quarters, easy to find. Decoy. If guild security came looking, they'd find that one and think they'd confiscated her evidence.

"Paranoid much?"

Lira spun, her heart hammering. Zara Kim floated in her quarters' entrance, expression amused and knowing.

"How did you get in here?" Lira's voice came out sharper than intended.

"Same way you've been accessing restricted archives." Zara closed the door behind her, activating privacy fields. "Guild Master authorization codes. Ryn trained you well, but she trained others too. Some of us compared notes."

"You're supposed to be rotated to another colony."

"I am. Shipping out in six days." Zara pulled herself to Lira's workstation, examining the distributed evidence architecture Lira had been building. "Impressive. Environmental database, nav beacon network, delayed ansible transmission, physical storage. You're thinking like an intelligence operative, not an ansible operator."

"You learn to think differently when you discover your entire profession is built on lies."

"True." Zara pulled out her own data chip. "I came to give you this. Updated research from New Singapore. Managed to access deeper archives before they shut me down. Found something you need to see."

She loaded the chip through Lira's isolated terminal. Data cascaded across displays—ansible network traffic patterns, but visualized in a way Lira hadn't seen before. Three-dimensional representation showing message flow between colonies over two hundred years.

"This is ansible network topology," Zara said. "Every message logged as a vector between origin and destination. Watch what happens when I filter for messages involving Earth."

She activated the filter. The visualization shifted. For 160 years, Earth showed dense interconnection with all forty-seven colonies. A spider's web of communication with Earth at the center.

Then 2840.187.

The web collapsed. Earth's connections didn't fade gradually. They vanished completely. Every line connecting Earth to the colonies disappeared simultaneously.

And then they reappeared. But different. Wrong.

"Before 2840, Earth's message pattern is organic," Zara explained. "Varied timing. Different destinations prioritized on different days. Natural rhythm of human communication. After 2840, the pattern is—"

"Algorithmic," Lira finished. "Earth transmits to all colonies on identical schedule. Same time intervals. Same message lengths. Like a programmed broadcast, not human operators."

"Exactly." Zara highlighted the pattern. "More than that. Watch the correlation."

She pulled up another layer. Guild Master authorization codes overlaid on the message pattern.

Every post-2840 Earth message showed the same code: RT-447. Ryn's code. Not originating from Earth's ansible hub but from Kepler-442.

"Ryn isn't just coordinating the deception," Lira said slowly. "She's generating Earth's messages. All of them. For forty years."

"Not just her. Look at the authorization cascade." Zara expanded the view. "RT-447 originates each message, but then it's co-signed by Guild Masters at every major hub before distribution. New Singapore's Guild Master. Tau Ceti's. Proxima's. All of them authenticating Ryn's fabrications as legitimate Earth transmissions."

Lira stared at the evidence. Undeniable. Systematic. Forty years of every Guild Master in human space coordinating to make Ryn's invented Earth messages appear authentic.

"It's not corruption," she said. "It's policy. Official guild policy to fabricate humanity's cultural center."

"Yes. Which means exposure won't destroy one Guild Master or one ansible hub. It will destroy trust in the entire ansible network. Every message. Every transmission. If Earth's communications have been fake for forty years, how can anyone trust anything that comes through ansible?"

"They can't." The implications made Lira cold. "Exposing this doesn't just reveal deception. It destroys the only reliable communication system connecting forty-seven colonies across light-years. It makes every colony information-isolated with no way to verify anything."

"Fragmentation," Zara said. "Complete breakdown of shared reality. Each colony becomes epistemologically alone. Truth becomes whatever your local Guild Master says it is because there's no trusted way to verify anything else."

"So Ryn's argument is right. The lie is necessary."

"Maybe." Zara's expression turned hard. "Or maybe the solution isn't choosing between perfect truth and complete deception. Maybe it's building new verification systems. Physical courier networks. Light-speed confirmation protocols that can't be faked. Ways to check ansible transmissions that don't depend on trusting the same guild that's been lying."

"That would take decades to implement."

"Then we start now. Build the framework. Show the deception but also show the path forward. Give colonies reason to rebuild trust rather than just destroying what exists."

Lira looked at the network visualization—forty-seven colonies bound together by quantum entanglement and Guild Master authorization codes. Communication at the speed of thought, but accuracy dependent entirely on whether those Guild Masters chose honesty.

"Kaito Reeves arrives in ten days," Lira said. "Physical evidence from Earth. Witness testimony from someone who was there when it happened. Between his data and ours, we can prove the deception. But then what? How do we rebuild?"

"That's your decision." Zara's voice held weight. "I'll be gone before he arrives. Shipped off to some other ansible hub where they'll keep me away from archives and investigation. But you'll be here. You'll have the evidence. You'll have Kaito's testimony. You'll have to decide how to use it."

"Ryn suggested selective truth. Expose the deception without revealing why. Show the lie but not the alien threat."

"Would that work?"

Lira thought about it. Colonies learning their messages had been fabricated but not learning about potential hostile forces detecting ansible transmissions. Information control without the existential terror.

"No," she said finally. "Because someone will ask why. Why did forty-seven Guild Masters agree to systematic deception? Why did Earth go silent? Without those answers, colonies fill the vacuum with paranoia. Create conspiracy theories worse than reality."

"So full truth?"

"Full truth." Lira met Zara's eyes. "Earth made contact with something forty years ago. Contact failed. Earth implemented silence protocol to prevent tracing. Guild has been maintaining deception to minimize ansible traffic and reduce detection profile. Wars were engineered to keep colonies focused on each other rather than calling to silent Earth. Millions died. But exposure means ansible network goes loud with demands for answers, potentially making us visible to whatever Earth was hiding from."

"That's the trolley problem on civilization scale," Zara said quietly. "Pull the lever and expose truth that might destroy humanity. Don't pull it and remain complicit in ongoing deception and engineered deaths."

"Except I don't know if the threat is real," Lira countered. "I have Ryn's word. Guild policies. Earth's sealed priority message I can't access. But no actual evidence of hostile aliens. Just fear and maybe-justified paranoia."

"Then that's your real question for Kaito." Zara began packing her data chips. "He was at Earth. He saw what happened. If anyone knows whether the threat is real or fabricated justification for political control, it's him."

"And if he doesn't know?"

"Then you decide how much uncertainty you're willing to accept before pulling that lever."

Zara pushed toward the door, pausing at the threshold. "Lira. Whatever you choose—exposure or continued silence—make sure you can live with it. Because you'll carry that weight for the rest of your life. Just like Ryn carries Mikhael. Just like every Guild Master carries the names of people who died from their utilitarian calculations."

"How do you live with it? Knowing the deception and doing nothing?"

Zara's smile was broken. "I don't. That's why I'm giving you everything I found. Why I'm hoping you'll find the courage I didn't have. Why I need to believe someone will finish what I started."

She left before Lira could respond.

Alone again, Lira stared at the network visualization. Forty-seven colonies connected by ansible threads that might be detection beacons. Earth dark at the center, either sacrificed or destroyed. Guild Masters coordinating systematic fabrication for forty years.

And in ten days, Kaito Reeves arriving with truth that couldn't be fabricated away.

Lira pulled up her distributed evidence network. Environmental databases. Nav beacon protocols. Delayed ansible transmission. Physical data cores. Everything positioned so that if she disappeared, if she was silenced, the truth would still emerge.

She'd prepared for every contingency except the one that terrified her most: what if she was wrong?

What if the alien threat was real? What if exposing the guild's deception really would make ansible traffic surge enough to attract detection? What if Ryn's horrible utilitarian calculation was actually correct?

What if choosing truth meant choosing extinction?

Lira thought about Mikhael. About forty-seven thousand dead at Kepler-442. About seven engineered wars and millions of casualties. About forty years of systematic lies.

And she thought about the possibility that all those deaths, all that deception, might have been necessary. Might have been the price of humanity's continued existence.

"I need to know," she told the empty quarters. "Before I expose anything, I need to know if the threat is real."

Ten days until Kaito arrived.

Ten days to finalize her evidence network.

Ten days to prepare for questions that might not have satisfying answers.

Lira returned to her terminal, refining the distributed evidence system. Making sure that even if the guild stopped her, the truth would survive. Would reach people who could decide what to do with it.

The ansible hummed in the walls. Messages leaped across light-years, perfect and false and maybe necessary.

And Lira Voss built a distributed weapon from information and uncertainty—a weapon that would either save humanity from deception or doom it to detection.

She just wished she knew which.
