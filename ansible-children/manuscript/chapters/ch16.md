# Chapter 16: Approach

The Kepler-442 ansible station grew larger in the Meridian Runner's viewport as they decelerated from relativistic speeds.

Lira had been here forty-two days ago as operator. Left as investigator. Returned as revolutionary.

"No increased security presence," Kaito reported, scanning sensor readings. "Normal patrol patterns. Either they're not expecting us or they're very confident in their containment."

"Ryn's expecting us," Lira said with certainty. "Magistrate calculated 73% probability I'd choose exposure. They've had three days to prepare since we left Zara's station. They know we're coming."

"Then it's a trap," Zara said from the engineering station. She'd insisted on coming for the final action. "We dock, we're arrested before reaching the ansible chamber."

"Maybe." Lira pulled up the station schematic. Highlighted their route from docking bay to Guild Master's terminal. "Or maybe Ryn's letting this happen. Letting me make the choice she couldn't make. Letting someone choose values over optimization."

The ansible station was beautiful in the light of Kepler-442's twin stars. Quantum communication hub connecting this colony to forty-six others across light-years. Architectural marvel. Engineering triumph. Beacon to extinction.

In three hours, if everything went according to plan, Lira would tell forty-seven colonies they'd been living in systematic deception for forty years. Would explain the Harvesters. Would recommend immediate ansible destruction. Would fracture human civilization for the sake of truth.

Or she'd be arrested. The Magistrate would implement Scenario Alpha. The lies would continue. And she'd spend the rest of her life in guild custody knowing she'd failed to give humanity the choice.

"Final approach clearance received," Kaito said. "Docking Bay Seven. Same bay we used before."

"Ryn's sense of poetry," Lira muttered. "Or the Magistrate's calculation that familiar territory reduces stress variables."

They docked. Airlocks cycled. Silence from guild security.

"This is definitely a trap," Zara said.

"Definitely," Lira agreed. She checked the encrypted data core containing her broadcast. Complete truth. Forty years of deception. Harvester threat. Voluntary ansible destruction recommendation. All verified. All ready for transmission.

She'd memorized the access codes. Memorized the transmission protocols. Memorized the path from docking bay to ansible chamber to Guild Master's terminal. If security stopped her, she'd have seconds to transmit before arrest.

Might be enough. Might not. But she'd try.

They exited the Meridian Runner. Corridors were empty. Not suspicious empty—scheduled empty. Third shift. Minimal personnel. Almost like someone had arranged the timing to minimize witnesses.

"Ryn's orchestrating this," Lira said aloud. "She's clearing our path."

"Why?" Kaito demanded, weapon ready. "Why help us destroy everything she built?"

"Because she's been carrying forty years of weight and she wants to put it down. Because she said she'd choose truth if she were starting fresh. Because—" Lira paused at a corridor intersection. Checked the schematic. "Because maybe she thinks we're right and she was wrong, and letting us expose the truth is her way of accepting judgment."

They moved deeper into the station. Maintenance tunnels. Service corridors. Paths Lira knew from three years of ansible operation. Every step closer to the Guild Master's chamber. Every step closer to the point of no return.

No security patrols. No automated alerts. No resistance.

"I don't like this," Zara said.

"Neither do I. But we're committed." Lira reached the final access point. Guild Master's chamber entrance. Military-grade security. Quantum encryption. Biometric verification.

She placed her hand on the scanner. Used her senior operator credentials.

The door opened.

Ryn Takada sat at the Guild Master's terminal, hands folded in her lap, waiting.

"Hello, child," she said quietly. "I calculated 89% probability you'd choose this path. Prepared accordingly."

Lira froze at the threshold. "You're stopping us."

"No." Ryn stood. Moved away from the terminal. "I'm helping you."

"What?"

"The Magistrate predicted you'd choose Scenario Gamma. Immediate broadcast. Maximum truth. Maximum casualties. It recommended I prevent your access, implement Scenario Alpha, maintain the deception." Ryn's smile was broken. "I overrode the recommendation. First time in forty years I've directly contradicted Magistrate guidance."

"Why?" Kaito kept his weapon trained on Ryn.

"Because I read your broadcast text. Zara's modeling of voluntary ansible destruction. Hybrid scenario the Magistrate didn't calculate because it requires human agency the AI doesn't comprehend." Ryn pulled up Lira's prepared transmission on the main display. "This is better than anything I would have written. Better than Magistrate optimization. Better than forty years of systematic lies."

Lira stared at her mentor. "You're letting me broadcast the truth?"

"I'm helping you broadcast the truth." Ryn entered her Guild Master authorization codes. The terminal opened to ansible network control—simultaneous transmission to all forty-seven colonies. "You wanted to take responsibility. You wanted to give people choice. You wanted to end the lies. I'm giving you that power."

"It'll kill billions," Lira said.

"I know. I've spent forty years killing millions to prevent killing billions. Your way might kill more. Or might save more. I genuinely don't know anymore." Ryn gestured at the terminal. "But I know continuing the lies isn't sustainable. I know the Magistrate's scenarios all end in massive casualties. I know humanity deserves the choice even if they choose poorly. So I'm stepping aside. I'm letting you do what I couldn't do. I'm accepting that forty years of optimization might have been wrong answer all along."

Silence filled the chamber.

"Magistrate will override you," Zara said. "Will stop the transmission."

"Magistrate is coordination AI, not control AI," Ryn corrected. "It makes recommendations. Guild Masters authorize implementation. I'm Guild Master. I'm authorizing Lira's broadcast." She pulled up system access. "I've suspended Magistrate monitoring for this chamber. We have seventeen minutes before it reestablishes connection and realizes what we're doing. Enough time to transmit. Not enough time for it to stop us."

"Why are you doing this?" Lira demanded.

Ryn met her eyes. Forty years of weight visible in her expression. "Because I'm tired. Because you were right when you said truth matters more than optimization. Because I want to stop being gardener of reality and accept judgment for forty years of playing god. Because—" Her voice broke. "Because Mikhael deserved better than being calculation in optimization algorithm. Because all one hundred thirty-eight million deserved better. Because humanity deserves choice even if choice is catastrophic."

She stepped back from the terminal. "Broadcast your truth, Lira Voss. Give them the choice. Accept the consequences. And when they judge us both—judge me for forty years of lies, judge you for exposing those lies—I'll stand beside you and accept whatever verdict comes."

Lira looked at the terminal. At ansible network control. At the power to transmit simultaneously to forty-seven colonies. At the prepared broadcast containing forty years of secrets.

Looked at Kaito and Zara. Both nodded. Both ready.

Looked at Ryn. Saw acceptance. Saw exhaustion. Saw hope that truth would be worth its price.

Looked at the timer. Seventeen minutes until Magistrate reestablished monitoring.

She accessed the ansible network. Loaded her broadcast. Verified simultaneous transmission protocols. Checked authentication—Ryn's Guild Master codes legitimizing the message as official guild communication, not conspiracy theory.

Everything ready. Everything verified. Everything about to change.

"Last chance to stop me," Lira said to Ryn.

"I'm not stopping you. I'm thanking you." Ryn's smile held forty years of grief. "For carrying what I couldn't carry anymore. For choosing what I couldn't choose. For ending what I couldn't end."

Lira's finger moved to the transmission control.

Paused.

Forty-three billion lives. Eighteen billion casualties projected. Thirty-eight billion survivors if voluntary compliance reached seventy percent. Nine billion saved through continued lies versus thirty-eight billion saved through informed choice.

Truth versus optimization. Values versus calculations. Agency versus control.

She thought of Mikhael. Of promises made. Of righteousness about lies. Of certainty that truth was always right.

Thought of eighteen billion deaths she'd be responsible for. Of blood on her hands. Of the weight Ryn had carried for forty years now passing to her.

No good choice. No right answer. Just values and consequences and the acceptance of burden.

"I'm sorry," Lira said. To the billions who would die. To the billions who would survive. To Ryn who'd carried the weight before her. To herself for becoming what she'd fought against.

"Don't be sorry," Ryn said. "Be human. That's all Earth asked. Be human. Make human choice, not optimized calculation. Accept human consequences."

Be human.

Lira transmitted.

The broadcast leaped across ansible network. Instantaneous. Unstoppable. Forty-seven colonies receiving truth simultaneously.

**PRIORITY ALPHA TRANSMISSION - ALL COLONIES**
**GUILD MASTER AUTHORIZATION: RT-447**
**AUTHENTICATION: VERIFIED OFFICIAL COMMUNICATION**

**COMPLETE DISCLOSURE: FORTY YEARS OF SYSTEMATIC DECEPTION**

*Earth's ansible has been silent for forty years. All messages attributed to Earth since 2840.187 have been fabricated by ansible guild to prevent civilization collapse.*

*Earth made contact with alien species who warned: ansible technology attracts automated hunter-killers called Harvesters. Earth deliberately destroyed their ansible to protect colonies. Earth population fate unknown.*

*Harvesters estimated arrival: thirty-seven years. Ansible network serves as beacon. Every transmission strengthens detection signal.*

*Guild has maintained deception while attempting FTL development. Current status: insufficient completion time. Projected survivors through continued deception: 8.7 billion average.*

*RECOMMENDATION: Immediate voluntary ansible destruction across all colonies. Coordinated network shutdown. Expected survival if seventy percent compliance: thirty-eight billion.*

*ALTERNATIVE: Maintain ansible network. Accept detection risk. Attempt FTL evacuation. Expected survival: 8.7 billion with significant failure probability.*

*CHOICE IS YOURS: Connection and risk, or isolation and survival.*

*I take full responsibility for this disclosure. I accept judgment for exposing forty years of lies. I accept responsibility for casualties resulting from this truth.*

*Earth's final words: Be human. Survive.*

*Choose how you will do both.*

*Lira Voss, Senior Ansible Operator, Kepler-442 Station*
*Ryn Takada, Guild Master, Authorizing Transmission*

The broadcast transmitted. Cascaded through ansible network. Reached forty-seven colonies simultaneously.

Truth delivered. Choice given. Consequences inevitable.

Lira looked at the timer. Fourteen minutes until Magistrate reestablished monitoring. Seconds before guild security realized what happened. Minutes before colonies started reacting.

She'd done it. Exposed forty years of systematic deception. Given humanity the information and the choice. Accepted responsibility for whatever came next.

"What now?" Zara asked.

"Now we wait," Ryn said. "Wait for colonies to respond. Wait for chaos or coordination. Wait for judgment."

"And when they come to arrest us?" Kaito asked.

"We don't resist," Lira said. "We accept custody. Accept trial. Accept whatever punishment comes. We told the truth. We accept the consequences."

The ansible hummed. Messages would be flooding the network now. Shock. Denial. Anger. Panic. Questions. Demands. Colonial governments reacting. Ansible operators verifying. Populations learning their entire shared reality was fabrication.

Truth spreading like infection or inoculation depending on perspective.

Lira had given them the choice. What they did with it was beyond her control now.

"Security approaching," Kaito said, monitoring sensors. "Guild enforcement. Two minutes."

"Let them come," Lira said. She looked at Ryn. "Thank you. For letting me do this. For choosing truth over optimization."

"Thank you for having courage I lacked," Ryn replied. "For forty years I chose the safe lie over dangerous truth. You chose better."

"Did I? We'll know in thirty-seven years. When Harvesters arrive or don't. When humanity survives unified or scattered or not at all."

"Yes. We'll know. Together." Ryn extended her hand.

Lira took it. Two ansible operators. Two truth-tellers. Two people who'd chosen agency over optimization and accepted the burden.

Guild security entered. Weapons drawn. Arrest protocols initiated.

Lira surrendered without resistance. Watched them secure Kaito and Zara. Watched them take Ryn—Guild Master who'd authorized the transmission that destroyed her own life's work.

They were arrested. They were contained. They were going to trial for destroying human civilization.

And they'd told the truth.

Forty-seven colonies now had the information. Had the choice. Had the agency to decide their own fate.

What they did with it—whether they chose connection or isolation, truth or denial, preparation or panic—was their choice now.

Not guild's choice. Not Magistrate's optimization. Not manipulation or deception or control.

Human choice. Made by humans. With human consequences.

As it should have been from the beginning.

The ansible chamber doors sealed. Custody cell ahead. Trial inevitable. Judgment coming.

But the truth was out. The lies were exposed. The choice was given.

And Lira Voss, whistleblower and revolutionary and murderer of billions or savior of humanity depending on how events unfolded, accepted the weight.

Accepted the responsibility.

Accepted being human in all its terrible complexity.

The ansible hummed its final lie-carrying transmission, then began to quiet as colonies started shutdown protocols.

Or didn't.

Time would tell.

Thirty-seven years or three weeks or tomorrow.

Truth had been told. Consequences would follow.

The only certainty: no one could say they died ignorant.

They'd die knowing. Die choosing. Die human.

If that was worth eighteen billion deaths, history would judge.

Lira had made her choice.

Now humanity would make theirs.
