# Chapter 14: Ryn's Burden

*Day 1, 2840.187*
*Earth is silent. Emergency council convened. We received Earth's final instruction: build coordination system, manage deception, buy time for FTL. Magistrate initialization begins today.*

*I volunteered to lead implementation. Thought I was strong enough. Thought forty years was manageable timeline. Thought lies told for survival were noble.*

*I was twenty-nine years old. I was an idiot.*

Lira read Ryn's journal chronologically. Forty years compressed into holographic text. Not guild records. Not official deliberations. Just one woman's private accounting of systematic deception.

*Year 2, 2842.103*
*First casualty I'm responsible for. Trade dispute between Proxima and Tau Ceti. Magistrate recommended modification creating controlled tension. I authorized. Twelve people died in accident during sanctions. I know their names. I will always know their names.*

The entries continued. Year by year. Death by death. Each conflict recorded with clinical precision and crushing guilt.

*Year 6, 2846.219*
*Proposed truth disclosure today. Magistrate showed me the numbers. Fifteen billion deaths. I couldn't do it. Couldn't pull that trigger. Voted to continue lies. Chen voted for truth. She was braver than me. She transferred to remote research station six months later. Haven't heard from her since.*

*How many Guild Masters will we lose to exhaustion? How many will break under this weight?*

"She catalogued everything," Lira said aloud. Kaito and Zara read over her shoulder. "Every death. Every decision. Every vote. Every resignation. Forty years of perfect record-keeping."

*Year 12, 2852.087*
*Kepler-442 and New Singapore resource dispute escalating. Magistrate recommends intervention. Calculated casualties: 2-5 million. Calculated prevention: 40-80 million in future systemic collapse. The math is clear. The math is always clear.*

*I hate the math. I hate being right. I hate that preventing worse wars requires starting smaller ones.*

*Authorized the modification. May whatever god exists forgive me. I can't forgive myself.*

Lira's hands shook. This entry was three years ago. This was Mikhael's war. This was her brother's death authorized with full knowledge of what would happen.

*Year 12, 2852.103*
*War ended. Casualty count: 3.1 million. Within projection. "Success" by optimization standards. Horror by human standards.*

*Among the dead: Mikhael Voss. Ansible operator Lira Voss's younger brother. She doesn't know I sent him to die. She doesn't know I calculate her brother's death was necessary for forty million lives saved.*

*She will know someday. I'm training her to discover this. Training her to carry this weight when I can't anymore. Is that education or cruelty?*

Ryn stood at the observation port, not watching them read. Just staring at stars.

"You knew you'd killed Mikhael," Lira said. "When you trained me afterward. When you taught me verification protocols. You knew."

"Yes." Ryn didn't turn around. "I knew if you were as good as I thought, you'd eventually discover the timestamp discrepancies. Would investigate. Would find the truth. Would hate me for it. I taught you anyway. Because someone needs to carry this forward when I can't."

Lira continued reading. Saw her own name appear repeatedly in later entries.

*Year 15, 2855.167*
*Lira Voss shows exceptional pattern recognition. Magistrate recommends her as potential contingency investigator. Training protocols designed to maximize discovery probability while ensuring understanding of context. Balancing truth-seeker creation with truth-seeker education.*

*She reminds me of myself at her age. Idealistic. Certain. Believing truth is simple and lies are always wrong. I'm going to destroy that certainty. And I'm doing it deliberately. May she forgive me someday.*

"You built me to investigate you," Lira said.

"I built you to survive discovering the truth," Ryn corrected. "There's a difference. Most investigators break when they learn the full scope. Become zealots for exposure or collaborators in deception. Few can hold the complexity—understanding both the necessity and the horror. I trained you for complexity."

Zara was reading later entries. "Year thirty-five. Magistrate suggests selective disclosure pathway. You jumped on it. Pushed for training contingency investigators across all colonies. Why?"

*Year 35, 2875.043*
*Contingency investigator protocol approved. Finally. I've been arguing for this for five years. Physical evidence is accumulating. Light-speed contradictions emerging. Discovery is inevitable within a decade.*

*Better to control how truth emerges. Better to have trained investigators who understand the impossible choices. Better to prepare for the lies' collapse than pretend they'll last forever.*

*I'm sixty-nine years old. Forty years carrying this weight. I want to put it down. I want someone else to decide. I want judgment even if it damns me.*

Lira looked up from the journal. "You're exhausted."

"Past exhaustion. Into something else. Resignation? Acceptance?" Ryn finally turned from the viewport. "Read the last entry. Dated three days ago."

*Year 40, 2880.086*
*Lira has accessed the Magistrate. Seen the scenario modeling. Understands the trolley problem at civilization scale. She's processing the weight now. Feeling the crush of impossible choices.*

*I should stop her. Should make her maintain deception. Should preserve forty years of lies.*

*Instead I'm going to give her my journals. Going to show her everything. Going to let her judge whether this was necessary or monstrous.*

*Because I genuinely don't know anymore. And I need someone to tell me.*

Silence filled the research station.

"You want me to absolve you," Lira said.

"I want you to tell me the truth," Ryn countered. "Was I right? Did the lies save humanity? Did engineering wars to prevent worse wars work? Did Mikhael's death purchase forty million lives? Or did I just murder millions and convince myself it was noble?"

"Both," Kaito said quietly. "You did both. That's what's horrifying."

Ryn's laugh was broken. "Yes. Both. The terrible certainty of moral complexity." She pulled up casualty statistics. "One hundred thirty-eight million dead from my authorized conflicts. Nine billion additional survivors from FTL evacuation plans that wouldn't exist without the deception. Both numbers real. Both my responsibility."

"What do you want me to do?" Lira asked.

"Whatever you think is right." Ryn met her eyes. "I gave you complete access. Complete information. Complete understanding. Now you choose. Expose the truth, knowing it kills billions. Maintain the lies, knowing it murders millions. Destroy the ansible, saving everyone but fragmenting humanity forever. I can't tell you which is right. I've spent forty years trying to calculate that and I still don't know."

"The Magistrate knows," Zara said. "Scenario Alpha minimizes total casualties while preserving unity."

"The Magistrate optimizes. Humans value." Ryn's voice held forty years of weight. "I optimized for forty years. I'm tired of optimization. I want someone to make choice based on values not calculations. Even if that choice is wrong mathematically."

Lira thought about her brother. About the promise to expose guild corruption. About righteous certainty that truth was always right.

Thought about eighteen billion casualties from immediate disclosure. About nine billion additional survivors from continued deception. About permanent fragmentation from ansible destruction.

No good choice. No right answer. Just values versus optimization in eternal conflict.

"I need more time," Lira said.

"You have six days until Magistrate deadline," Ryn said. "After that, the AI implements whatever it calculates you're likely to choose based on your behavior patterns."

"What's it calculate I'll choose?"

"Scenario Gamma. Immediate broadcast. Maximum truth. Maximum casualties." Ryn pulled up Magistrate probability assessment. "73% chance you choose full disclosure despite understanding the cost. Because you value truth over optimization."

"And if I do?"

"Then I'll implement damage control protocols. Try to minimize the eighteen billion deaths. Fail to save most of them. Watch civilization fracture." Ryn's voice was hollow. "And accept that forty years of lies bought humanity nothing but delayed collapse."

"Or?" Kaito pressed.

"Or you choose Scenario Alpha. Maintain deception. Let me continue managing the lies. Accept complicity in exchange for nine billion additional survivors. Become what I am—gardener of reality, murderer of millions, savior of billions."

"Or Scenario Beta," Zara added. "Destroy the ansible. No deaths from Harvesters. But permanent isolation. Humanity fractures into forty-seven divergent species. Common culture ends."

Ryn nodded. "Three choices. All terrible. All defensible. All catastrophic in different ways. Welcome to four decades of my life compressed into your next six days."

Lira stood. Floated to the observation port. Stared at the same stars Ryn had been watching.

"What would you choose?" Lira asked. "If you were me. Starting fresh. Knowing everything. What would you do?"

"I'd choose truth," Ryn said immediately. "I'd expose everything. I'd accept the casualties. Because living with forty years of lies has taught me something optimization can't calculate—surviving isn't the same as living. And humanity can't truly live while locked in deception."

"But you won't choose that," Lira said. "You'll keep lying."

"Because I've committed to the path. Can't unchoose forty years of decisions. Can't undo one hundred thirty-eight million deaths. Can only continue forward and hope FTL succeeds before Harvesters arrive." Ryn moved toward the airlock. "But you're not committed. You can still choose. Can still pull humanity out of the lies before they solidify into permanent state."

"Even if it kills billions?"

"Even then. Because those billions deserve to know why they're dying. Deserve to choose how they face extinction. Deserve truth even if truth is lethal." Ryn paused at the threshold. "I spent forty years protecting people from terrible knowledge. It didn't make them safer. Just made them ignorant of the danger. Maybe that was wrong choice all along."

She left. Shuttle departing back toward Kepler-442. Back toward the ansible network she'd managed for forty years. Back toward the lies that were slowly killing her.

Lira pulled up the Magistrate's assessment. Watched probability curves calculating her decision based on cognitive profile and behavioral patterns.

73% chance Scenario Gamma. Truth. Casualties. Collapse.

Six days to decide if the AI was right about her.

Six days to choose between optimization and values.

Six days to determine if truth was worth the price.

The journal remained open on her display. Forty years of impossible choices. Forty years of one woman trying to save humanity by controlling it.

Forty years that would end with whatever Lira decided next.

No pressure, her mind whispered sarcastically.

Just the fate of forty-three billion people.

Just truth versus survival.

Just the choice that would define whether humanity died honest or lived deceived.

Six days.

Choose.
