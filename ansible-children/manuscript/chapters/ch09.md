# Chapter 9: Verification

The ansible station had seventy-three exits if you counted emergency airlocks. Forty-two if you excluded sections that would trigger catastrophic decompression alarms. Eleven if you needed to avoid guild security monitoring.

Lira had precisely one option that Kaito's relativistic trader contacts could access without detection.

She floated in her quarters forty-eight hours after Ryn had shown her Earth's final transmission, mentally reviewing the escape route for the hundredth time. Maintenance tunnel seven-alpha. Through the waste reclamation system. Out the secondary coolant vent that aligned with Kaito's ship's docking vector every eight hours during station rotation.

They had a twelve-minute window starting at 0340 hours. Miss it, and the next alignment wasn't for another sixteen hours—plenty of time for guild security to discover she'd left her quarters.

If they hadn't discovered already.

Lira pulled up her personal terminal, calling up the ansible traffic analysis she'd been compiling for the past two days. Not investigation anymore. Verification. The word Ryn had used echoed in her thoughts: *You need to verify if the Harvester threat is real.*

She needed to know if Earth's warning was truth or manipulation. If forty years of deception had saved humanity or merely delayed inevitable exposure.

And she needed answers the guild wouldn't—couldn't—provide.

Her terminal chimed. Encrypted message, triple-bounce through ansible relay nodes. Kaito.

*Exit seven-alpha compromised. Guild security sweep scheduled 0330. Alternate route: observation deck emergency lock, section nineteen. Window opens 0425, duration four minutes. Confirm receipt.*

Lira's pulse hammered. They'd anticipated the maintenance tunnel. Of course they had—Ryn knew how Lira thought, knew the station's architecture, knew every escape route a trained ansible operator would consider.

She coded acknowledgment, then began deleting every trace of the message. Guild monitored everything, but encryption bought time. Hours, maybe. Enough to get off-station before they realized she'd broken confinement.

Except she hadn't been confined. That was the disturbing part.

Ryn had released them. Shown them Earth's final transmission. Explained the Harvester threat. And then... let them go. Back to quarters. Back to "thinking about what we'd learned." As if forty years of systematic deception could be processed like routine maintenance data.

As if Ryn believed showing them the horror would be enough to convince them continued lies were necessary.

Maybe Ryn was right. Maybe knowing about Harvesters should have made Lira drop her investigation. Should have made her understand that some truths were too dangerous for humanity to handle.

Instead, she needed to verify. Needed to know if the threat was real or if it was the ultimate lie in a network of lies.

The door chimed.

Lira froze. 0312 hours. Too early for shift change. Too late for routine check-ins.

"Lira?" Darin's voice. "You awake?"

She gestured, dismissing the escape route calculations. "Come in."

He floated through, looking uncomfortable. "Guild Master wants to see you. Both of you. You and that trader."

"When?"

"Now." Darin's expression held concern. "Look, I don't know what's going on. But Ryn seems... different. Like she's made some kind of decision and it's breaking her."

Lira studied Darin's face. Sweet, honest Darin who believed in the system because questioning it never occurred to him. "Did she say what she wants to discuss?"

"Said it's time for full disclosure. Said you need to understand everything before you do something that can't be undone." He hesitated. "Lira, what's going on? What did you discover that has Guild Master this rattled?"

Everything. She'd discovered everything. Earth's silence. Forty years of fabrication. Harvesters approaching in thirty-seven years. The choice between ansible unity and human survival.

"I can't tell you," Lira said quietly. "Not yet. But Darin—" She pulled out the physical data core she'd hidden three weeks ago. The one containing all her evidence. "I need you to hold onto this. Don't open it. Don't tell anyone you have it. Just... keep it safe. If something happens to me, if I disappear or get reassigned to some distant colony, open it. Read everything. And decide what to do with that information."

Darin stared at the data core. "This is evidence of something illegal, isn't it?"

"This is evidence of truth." Lira pressed it into his hand. "Which might be the same thing. I don't know anymore."

He closed his fingers around it. "You're scaring me."

"I'm scared too." She pushed past him, heading toward the door. "Where's the trader?"

"Docking Bay Seven. Ryn's waiting there with him."

Lira floated through the station's corridors, her mind calculating probabilities. Ryn calling both of them. At this hour. For "full disclosure."

Either Ryn was making one final attempt to bring them into the conspiracy, or she was preparing to disappear them both before they could expose the truth.

The docking bay smelled of recirculated air and ozone from recent ship arrivals. Kaito floated near his ship's airlock, flanked by guild security. Not restraints. Not weapons. Just presence.

Message clear: You're not prisoners. You're also not leaving.

Ryn stood by the observation port, silhouetted against Kepler-442's ice rings. She turned as Lira entered.

"Thank you for coming," Ryn said. Formal. Guild Master speaking, not mentor. "I've been considering our conversation two days ago. About verification. About your need to understand the full scope before deciding whether to expose the guild's deception."

"And?" Kaito's voice was flat.

"And you're right." Ryn pulled up a holographic authorization interface. "I've spent forty years protecting secrets. Deciding what humanity could handle and what they couldn't. Playing god with information." Her hands moved through the interface, entering access codes. "I'm tired of it. Tired of the weight. Tired of being the only one carrying this knowledge."

She gestured. A data core materialized in the holographic field—virtual representation of files Lira had never seen before.

"This contains everything," Ryn continued. "Full ansible archives. Unredacted guild council deliberations. Earth's complete message history. Technical specifications showing ansible quantum signatures and their theoretical detectability. Independent analysis of Harvester threat probability. FTL research progress reports. Casualty projections for every scenario we've modeled over forty years."

Lira stared. "You're giving us classified information?"

"I'm giving you verification." Ryn met her eyes. "You said you need to know if the threat is real. These files will answer that question. They'll show you exactly what Earth learned, exactly what the aliens told them, exactly why we made the choices we made."

"Why now?" Kaito demanded. "Why not forty years ago? Why not when Earth first went silent?"

"Because forty years ago, I believed controlling information would save humanity." Ryn's voice cracked. "I believed the lie was kindness. That protecting people from terrifying truth was noble. That buying time for solutions was worth the deception."

"And now?"

"Now I think maybe Lira's right. Maybe humanity deserves to choose. Even if their choice is wrong." Ryn transferred the data core to Lira's terminal. "Read everything. Verify everything. If you still believe exposure is necessary after seeing the complete picture, I won't stop you."

Lira didn't move. "This is a trap."

"This is exhaustion," Ryn countered. "Forty years of impossible choices. I need someone else to carry this weight. Even if that means you use it to destroy everything I've built."

The data core glowed in Lira's visual field. Complete answers. Everything she'd been searching for. Everything the guild had hidden.

Or everything Ryn wanted her to believe.

"How do we know it's real?" Lira asked. "How do we know you're not showing us curated files designed to justify your deception?"

"You don't." Ryn's smile was bitter. "That's the problem with lies, child. Once trust is broken, everything becomes suspect. Even truth."

Kaito pushed off from the wall. "I'll tell you how we know. We verify against physical evidence. Against my ship's sensor logs from Earth. Against light-speed transmissions. Against everything that can't be modified by ansible manipulation."

"Yes," Ryn said. "Exactly. Which is why—" She gestured at the security officers. They stepped aside, clearing the path to Kaito's ship. "You're free to leave. Take the files. Compare them against your physical evidence. Verify every claim. And when you've confirmed the Harvester threat is real, come back. Help us find a solution that doesn't require forty more years of lies."

Lira looked at Kaito. He looked equally skeptical.

"If we leave," Lira said slowly, "you're letting us take classified information off-station. Information that could destroy the guild's credibility. Information that could fracture human civilization. You're just... allowing that?"

"I'm choosing trust," Ryn said. "Choosing to believe you want truth for the right reasons. That you'll use this information responsibly once you understand the full stakes."

"Or," Kaito said, "you're confident these files will convince us to maintain your deception."

"Perhaps both." Ryn moved toward the exit. "I have one request. Give me seventy-two hours before you broadcast anything. Three days to complete FTL prototype trials, evacuate critical research personnel, prepare ansible hubs for potential shutdown. If you're going to trigger civilization collapse, let me save who I can first."

She left before Lira could respond.

Security officers followed, leaving Lira and Kaito alone in the docking bay.

"It's a trap," Kaito said immediately.

"Obviously." Lira pulled up the data core, examining its structure. Massive. Terabytes of records. "Question is: what kind of trap?"

"Information trap. Show us files that justify their lies. Make us complicit. Turn us into believers in the necessary deception."

"Or she's genuine. Exhausted. Desperate for someone to share the burden." Lira began copying files to her encrypted storage. "Either way, these are guild archives. Real data, even if it's selectively compiled. We can verify against your physical evidence. Cross-reference. Find the truth underneath whatever narrative she's constructed."

Kaito accessed his ship's systems. "Forty-two hours until station security sweep changes personnel. Seventy-two hours until Ryn's deadline. We need to be gone before either of those timelines converge."

"Gone where?"

"Somewhere we can analyze this data without guild surveillance. Somewhere with ansible monitoring equipment so we can verify against network traffic. Somewhere—"

"Zara's research station," Lira said. "Independent facility in deep space. Ansible monitoring capability. Outside guild jurisdiction."

"Zara Kim? Your xenolinguist friend?"

"She's been investigating ansible patterns for years. Has equipment to analyze these files. And most importantly—" Lira pulled up navigation data. "She's four days' travel at relativistic speeds. Close enough to get there fast. Far enough that guild response takes time."

Kaito began running pre-flight calculations. "We launch now, we're committed. No coming back to plead ignorance or negotiate."

"We were committed the moment we started investigating." Lira transferred the guild archives to isolated storage. "I have physical data cores distributed across the station. Dead-man's switch ansible transmissions queued. If the guild makes us disappear, the evidence survives."

"Unless they find it all."

"They won't find everything. I learned from the best." Lira's smile was grim. "Ryn taught me thoroughness. Redundancy. Never trust single point of failure. She created the perfect student for exposing secrets."

They worked in silence for twenty minutes, loading data, preparing Kaito's ship, running pre-flight diagnostics. The Meridian Runner was old but reliable—fusion torch capable of 0.3c, radiation shielding robust enough for deep space, life support rated for decades of subjective time.

More than enough for a four-day sprint to Zara's research station.

"We're going to fracture human civilization," Kaito said quietly. "If we verify the Harvesters are real and still expose the deception."

"Maybe." Lira finished the final data transfer. "Or we give humanity the information they need to survive. Even if survival is terrifying."

"Ryn asked for seventy-two hours. Are we giving her that?"

Lira thought about Mikhael. About the war engineered to kill him. About forty years of lies told for "humanity's protection." About Ryn's exhausted face asking someone to share the weight.

"No," she said. "We verify first. If the Harvester threat is real and immediate, we revisit the question. But I won't give her time to fabricate better justifications or contain evidence we haven't found."

Kaito began the launch sequence. "Then we're fugitives."

"We were always fugitives. We just pretended otherwise for a few days."

The Meridian Runner's engines warmed up. Fusion torch preparing to push them away from Kepler-442, away from the ansible station where Lira had spent her entire life, away from the guild that had shaped everything she believed about truth and communication.

Away from Ryn, who had taught her to value accuracy above all else and then betrayed that lesson for forty years.

"Last chance to change your mind," Kaito said.

Lira looked at the ansible station through the viewport. Looked at the quantum communication network that connected forty-seven human worlds. Looked at the beautiful, perfect system built on systematic lies.

"Launch," she said.

The Meridian Runner accelerated. Fusion torch burning. Pushing them toward relativistic speeds. Toward Zara's research station. Toward verification and truth and whatever catastrophe waited beyond.

Behind them, ansible operators transmitted instantaneous messages across light-years. In front of them, four days of subjective time stretched toward answers.

And somewhere, thirty-seven years away at relativistic speeds, automated Harvesters potentially moved toward human space, drawn by the quantum signature of an ansible network humanity didn't understand.

Lira pulled up the guild archives Ryn had given them. Terabytes of files. Forty years of secrets.

Time to verify if the nightmare was real.

Or if it was just another layer of lies.

Either way, she'd know the truth before deciding whether to broadcast it to forty-seven colonies.

The ansible hummed in the distance, growing fainter as they accelerated away.

And Lira Voss, ansible operator turned fugitive, began reading Earth's complete history.

Word by terrible word.
