# Chapter 18: Aftermath

The holding cell was three meters by four, zero gravity, absolutely secure.

Lira had been here before, six weeks ago, when Ryn had shown her Earth's final message. Then, she'd been detained as investigator requiring education. Now, she was imprisoned as revolutionary requiring containment.

Different status. Same cell. Appropriate symmetry.

Forty-eight hours since the broadcast. Forty-eight hours since truth spread across forty-seven colonies simultaneously. Forty-eight hours to watch humanity's reaction through the limited ansible traffic Lira could monitor from her cell.

The reactions were exactly as terrible as predicted.

**Hour 1-6**: Denial. Colonial governments demanding verification. Ansible operators cross-referencing records. Physical evidence requested. Emergency council sessions convened.

**Hour 7-12**: Confirmation. Too many independent verification sources. Physical records from multiple trade ships. Light-speed confirmations matching Lira's claims. Guild's own archived records leaking as operators started checking. Denial collapsed into acceptance.

**Hour 13-24**: Panic. Populations learning forty years of messages from Earth were fabrications. Learning Harvesters approached. Learning ansible was death beacon. Riots in major colonies. Ansible stations attacked. Guild operators assaulted. Three stations already destroyed by mobs.

**Hour 25-36**: Fragmentation. Colonial governments splitting between Contact faction (destroy ansible immediately) and Memory faction (maintain network, risk Harvesters). Some colonies shutting down ansible stations. Others broadcasting at maximum capacity trying to coordinate response. Network traffic surging exactly as Magistrate predicted.

**Hour 37-48**: War. Tau Ceti and Proxima Centauri shooting war began. Tau Ceti trying to destroy Proxima's ansible by force. Proxima defending. Already four million casualties. The war Lira had caused to prevent... had started anyway. Just with different justification.

She floated in her cell, watching civilization fracture in real-time through ansible traffic analysis displays the guild hadn't bothered to disable.

They wanted her to see. Wanted her to witness the consequences of her choice. Wanted her to carry the weight of billions suffering because she'd told the truth.

The door cycled open. Zara floated through, also in custody but apparently given mobility privileges Lira lacked.

"Thought you'd want an update," Zara said. Her voice was hollow. "Twenty-two colonies have shut down ansible stations completely. Nineteen maintain full operation. Six are in civil conflict about whether to destroy or preserve. Ansible network traffic down forty-seven percent but not eliminated."

"How many casualties so far?" Lira asked.

"Eight million confirmed. Thirty-two million estimated when you account for communication delays and ongoing conflicts." Zara pulled up statistical models. "Magistrate's eighteen billion projection looks increasingly accurate. Maybe optimistic."

Eight million already. In forty-eight hours.

Mikhael had been one of three million over three years of war. Lira had killed more people in two days than Ryn had killed in four decades.

"Kaito?" Lira asked.

"Separate detention. Same station. He's... processing. Keeps calculating whether physical evidence was worth the cost." Zara's hands moved through holographic displays nervously. "Guild is preparing trial. Charges include: unauthorized access to classified systems, theft of guild property, dissemination of protected information, incitement of colonial violence, conspiracy to destroy ansible network, crimes against humanity."

"All accurate charges," Lira said.

"Yes. And defense?"

"We tell the truth. We explain why we chose to broadcast. We accept the verdict." Lira watched ansible traffic continue to surge and collapse chaotically. "What's Ryn's status?"

"Under investigation. Guild council suspended her authorization pending trial. Magistrate recommended she be charged as co-conspirator." Zara paused. "She's not fighting it. Says she authorized the transmission. Says she accepts responsibility. Says she's glad it's over."

"Is it over?" Lira asked. "Or just beginning?"

"Depends on whether colonies choose ansible destruction or defense. If we hit seventy percent shutdown like your broadcast recommended, Harvesters can't locate us. If we don't... " Zara let the implication hang.

"Then I killed billions and failed to save anyone."

"Or you gave them choice and they chose poorly. There's a difference."

"Is there? When the outcome is the same?" Lira pulled up casualty projections. Watched them climb. "Magistrate was right. Scenario Gamma. Eighteen billion casualties. Maybe more. All because I valued truth over optimization."

"All because billions of people deserved to know they were living in fabrication," Zara corrected. "All because agency matters even if people use it self-destructively."

The door cycled again. Kaito floated through, escorted by guild security but allowed entry.

"They're letting us talk," he said. "Making sure we can coordinate defense for trial. Or making sure we can watch each other break under weight of casualties." He floated beside Lira. "I've been reviewing ansible traffic. Running analysis. Comparing current chaos to what would have happened under Scenario Alpha."

"And?"

"And it's worse. Truth exposure is killing more people faster than engineered conflicts would have. Magistrate's models were accurate. We fucked up."

"Or we gave people choice and they're fucking up," Zara countered. "That's not on us."

"Isn't it?" Kaito pulled up war statistics. "We knew this would happen. We knew truth would cause chaos. We chose to broadcast anyway. That makes us responsible."

"For their choices?"

"For creating the conditions that led to their choices. For triggering the panic. For fracturing the system that kept them alive."

Silence filled the cell.

Lira watched the numbers climb. Eight million dead. Becoming nine million. Becoming ten million. Every death traceable back to her broadcast forty-eight hours ago.

Every death her responsibility whether she accepted it or not.

"Ryn wants to see you," Kaito said quietly. "Guild is allowing it. Supervised meeting in twelve hours. She has something she wants to share before trial begins."

"What?"

"Didn't say. Just that you deserve to know how this ends."

"This isn't over yet," Lira said. "This is just beginning."

"That's what she said too." Kaito pushed off toward the door. "Twelve hours. They'll come get you."

He left. Zara remained.

"Are you okay?" Zara asked.

"No." Lira watched ansible traffic fragment. Watched colonies split. Watched humanity tear itself apart over the truth she'd given them. "I'm responsible for more deaths in two days than the guild caused in forty years. I broke what I was trying to save. I killed billions trying to give them freedom."

"You gave them choice," Zara insisted. "What they do with it isn't your fault."

"Keep telling yourself that. Maybe you'll believe it eventually."

Zara was quiet for a long moment. Then: "I ran alternate timelines. Modeled what would have happened if you'd chosen Scenario Alpha instead. Maintained deception. Let guild continue lies."

"And?"

"And FTL development had sixty-seven percent success probability. Meaning thirty-three percent chance of complete failure. If it failed, all forty-three billion dead when Harvesters arrived. If it succeeded, thirty-one billion still dead from insufficient evacuation capacity." Zara pulled up probability trees. "Your choice kills eighteen billion through chaos. Their choice would have killed thirty-one billion through Harvesters or all forty-three billion through FTL failure. Your casualties are lower."

"Are they? Or did I just cause eighteen billion immediate deaths AND still leave humanity vulnerable to Harvesters because only sixty-two percent of colonies destroyed their ansibles?"

"We don't know yet. Network traffic is still stabilizing. More colonies may choose shutdown after seeing the chaos. Or more may choose to maintain network out of spite." Zara's voice held exhaustion. "Point is: there was no good choice. You chose values over optimization. You chose agency over safety. You chose truth over deception. Maybe that's all anyone can do."

Maybe.

Or maybe Lira had just committed the greatest mass murder in human history and was desperately justifying it with philosophy.

"Leave me alone," Lira said. "I need to process this. Need to carry this. Need to... I don't know. Accept that I'm monster who killed billions for principle."

"You're not a monster. You're someone who made impossible choice and accepted the consequences."

"Aren't those the same thing?"

Zara didn't have an answer for that. She left. Cell door sealed.

Lira floated alone with casualty statistics and ansible traffic analysis and the weight of eighteen billion projected deaths.

She'd done what she thought was right. Given people truth. Given them choice. Given them agency.

And they'd used that agency to kill each other by the millions.

Maybe Ryn was right all along. Maybe optimization was more important than values. Maybe survival mattered more than dignity. Maybe lies that saved billions were better than truth that killed them.

But it was too late for maybes.

The truth was out. The consequences were unfolding. The casualties were mounting.

All Lira could do was watch and carry the weight and accept that she'd chosen this path.

Chosen truth over safety.
Chosen agency over protection.
Chosen values over optimization.

And caused the exact catastrophe everyone had warned her would happen.

Twelve hours until meeting with Ryn. Twelve hours to process eight million deaths becoming eighteen billion. Twelve hours to prepare for whatever Ryn wanted to share about "how this ends."

As if this had an ending.

As if consequences ever stopped cascading.

As if blood ever washed off hands that pulled triggers, even triggers that needed pulling.

The ansible hummed its dying song. Traffic fragmenting. Network collapsing. Exactly as predicted.

Lira closed her eyes and tried not to count the dead.

Failed.

Kept counting anyway.

That was her responsibility now. To remember every casualty. To carry every name. To accept that she'd killed them all by telling them the truth.

Ryn had carried one hundred thirty-eight million for forty years.

Lira had already passed eight million in forty-eight hours.

Welcome to the burden.

Welcome to being gardener of reality.

Welcome to learning that sometimes the optimized lie saves more than the valued truth.

Welcome to living with that knowledge forever.

The ansible hummed.

The casualties mounted.

And Lira Voss learned what carrying impossible choices really meant.
