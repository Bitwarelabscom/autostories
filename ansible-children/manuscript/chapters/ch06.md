# Chapter 6: Approach Vector

The *Meridian Runner* decelerated into Kepler-442 space like a ghost ship carrying truth across decades.

Lira watched from the ansible station's observation deck as the trader's fusion torch painted blue-white fire against the ice rings. Twenty-three years objective since leaving Sol System. Her entire adult life compressed into that ship's relativistic journey.

Kaito Reeves had been at Earth when it went silent. Had witnessed whatever made humanity's origin world implement silence protocol. Had carried physical evidence across light-years and subjective years, waiting for someone who could understand what he'd seen.

She'd been preparing for this meeting for twenty-three days. Since she first discovered the timestamp discrepancies. Since Ryn warned her to stop investigating. Since she learned her brother died in an engineered war.

Since she discovered humanity might be hiding from something worse than deception.

"Beautiful ship," Darin said beside her. "Old model. Pre-2800 fusion torch design. You don't see many of those still operational."

Lira pulled up the *Meridian Runner*'s specifications on her personal terminal. Forty-eight years old. Built at Tau Ceti Yards before the trade wars. Mass: 2,400 metric tons. Maximum acceleration: 0.3c. Current velocity: 0.15c and decelerating.

And cargo manifest: "Physical data archives and verification media from Sol Relay Station."

Physical evidence. Unalterable. Immune to ansible fabrication.

"Trader requested meeting with senior ansible operator," Darin continued. "Specifically asked for you. By name. That's unusual, right?"

"Very." Lira kept her voice neutral. "He probably heard about my work on timestamp verification. Traders like having their cargo arrival times calculated precisely."

The lie tasted familiar now. She'd been lying for twenty-three days. To Darin. To other operators. To everyone except Zara, who'd shipped out three days ago to her reassignment.

Lying while investigating a conspiracy built on lies. The irony didn't escape her.

"Guild Master Takada wants to meet him first," Darin said. "Security protocol for traders carrying classified material. She asked me to let her know when you head to the docking bay."

Ice flooded Lira's chest. "Did she."

"Yeah. Said she's concerned about information security. Something about Sol System data potentially containing sensitive political content." Darin's expression showed no suspicion. He trusted Ryn. Trusted the guild. Trusted that their orders made sense.

Lira had been like that once. Before she started questioning. Before she learned that trust in institutions required those institutions to be trustworthy.

"I'll coordinate with Guild Master," Lira said. "Thanks for the update."

Darin floated away toward his duty station, leaving Lira alone with the viewport and her calculations.

Ryn knew Kaito was arriving. Had known for twenty-three years, according to her own admission. Had been tracking his ship across light-years, waiting for him to bring evidence that couldn't be suppressed.

And now Ryn wanted to intercept him before Lira could make contact.

Which meant Lira had to make contact first.

She pulled up the station's internal monitoring systems, accessing duty schedules and security rotations. Thirty minutes until Ryn's regular check-in with guild operations. Twenty minutes until *Meridian Runner* reached docking distance. Fifteen minutes until Kaito would request berthing clearance.

A very narrow window.

Lira activated her encrypted comm channel—the one she'd built using the same backdoor protocols she'd learned from Ryn. Private. Unmonitored. The same channel she'd used to coordinate with Zara.

"*Meridian Runner*, this is Kepler-442 Ansible Operations, Senior Operator Voss. Private channel, encrypted. Are you receiving?"

Static. Then a voice—slow, deliberate, carrying accents from half a dozen worlds.

"Receiving, Operator Voss. Kaito Reeves. Was hoping you'd reach out before official channels got involved."

"You asked for me specifically."

"Your name kept coming up in my research. Lira Voss. Third-generation guild member. Trained by Ryn Takada. Lost your brother Mikhael in the Kepler-442/New Singapore war." A pause. "A war that started from disputed ansible messages. Figured if anyone had reason to question ansible integrity, it was you."

"You figured right." Lira checked the chronometer. Eighteen minutes until docking. "I know why you're here. I know what you're carrying. And I know the guild is going to try to intercept you before we can talk."

"Expected that. Been carrying this data for twenty-three years objective. Guild's had plenty of time to plan their containment response."

"Then why come? If you knew they'd stop you?"

"Because someone needs to know the truth. Because my friend died getting me this evidence. Because—" His voice shifted, carrying weight of decades and light-years. "Because I was at Earth. I saw what happened. And humanity deserves to know what we're hiding from. Or what we think we're hiding from."

Lira's hands tightened on her terminal. "You don't know if the threat is real."

"I know Earth believed it was real enough to sacrifice themselves. I know they implemented silence protocol and cut off all communication to protect the colonies. I know they died alone, thirty billion people, while we fabricated their continued existence." His voice went flat. "Whether the threat was real or paranoia doesn't change what was lost."

"Thirty billion people dead?"

"That's my working theory. Can't prove it without ansible confirmation, and ansible confirmations from Earth have been fake for forty years." A bitter laugh. "Which is why I brought physical data. Hard evidence. Things that can't be modified in transit."

Fifteen minutes.

"Docking Bay Seven," Lira said. "Private conference room attached. I'll deactivate monitoring systems for that bay during your approach. Guild will flag it as maintenance issue. Should buy us an hour before they realize."

"An hour isn't enough time to review the data I'm carrying."

"Then we make it enough." Lira pulled up her distributed evidence network, preparing to integrate Kaito's physical archives with her ansible analysis. "I have evidence from this end. Timestamp discrepancies. Message modifications. The 2840 pattern shift. Network topology showing guild-wide coordination. You have evidence from Earth's end. Together we can prove the deception is systematic and show exactly when it started."

"And then?"

"And then we decide whether to expose it. Whether truth about ansible manipulation is worth the risk of colonies knowing Earth is gone."

"Worth the risk of ansible traffic surging enough to attract whatever Earth was hiding from."

"If that threat exists." Lira's voice held the doubt she'd been carrying for days. "I need to know, Kaito. I need to know if the alien contact was real. If Earth really made contact with something dangerous. If the guild's justification for forty years of deception and engineered wars is based on reality or convenient fear."

Silence on the channel. Then: "I can show you what I saw. What I recorded from orbit when Earth went silent. You can judge for yourself if the threat is real."

Twelve minutes.

Lira checked guild security patterns. Ryn would finish her coordination meeting in eight minutes. Then she'd head directly to the docking bay to intercept Kaito. Standard containment protocol.

Unless Lira was already there.

She pushed off from the observation deck, moving through the station's corridors with practiced efficiency. Zero-gravity ballet learned over a lifetime of ansible hub operation. Past duty stations where operators transmitted lies across light-years. Past the memorial chamber where Mikhael's name marked deliberate murder disguised as war casualty. Past the ansible chambers where quantum entanglement made communication instantaneous and deception equally fast.

Docking Bay Seven. The door required authorization. Lira used her codes, grateful Ryn hadn't revoked her access. Yet.

The bay was empty except for maintenance drones. She activated the observation port, watching *Meridian Runner* make final approach. The ship was scarred. Decades of micro-impacts from interstellar dust. Hull patches showing multiple repairs. Fusion torch flickering with the characteristic instability of old systems pushed hard.

A ship that had traveled light-years carrying truth no one wanted to hear.

Lira accessed the bay's monitoring systems, triggering a diagnostic cycle that would appear as routine maintenance but actually disabled surveillance for the next two hours. Guild security would notice eventually. But by then she'd have Kaito's evidence.

Her terminal chimed. Encrypted message from Ryn:

*I know what you're doing. I know you're meeting him. Please. Talk to me first. Let me explain before you make this decision.*

Lira stared at the message. Her mentor. Her teacher. The woman who'd raised her in the guild's culture of accuracy and precision. The woman who'd been lying professionally for forty years.

The woman who'd deliberately sent Mikhael to his death.

She deleted the message without responding.

Eight minutes later, *Meridian Runner* locked into docking clamps with the solid thunk of metal on metal. Physical connection. Real. Unmediated by quantum uncertainty or ansible manipulation.

The airlock cycled. Pressure equalized. The hatch opened.

Kaito Reeves floated through, and Lira's first thought was that he looked like someone built from ships and distance. Tattoos mapping colonies he'd visited. Eyes that focused past nearby objects. Loose-kneed stance of permanent acceleration adaptation.

And a hard-case data storage unit magnetically sealed to his suit.

"Senior Operator Voss." He extended his hand—physical contact, real and immediate. "Appreciate you risking this meeting."

"Call me Lira." She gripped his hand, feeling the calluses of decades working ships. "And I'm not risking anything that isn't already at risk. The guild knows I've been investigating. This just accelerates the timeline."

"Then we'd better move fast." Kaito pulled himself toward the conference room. "I've been carrying this evidence for twenty-seven years subjective. Let me show you what Earth was so afraid of that they chose silence over survival."

They sealed themselves in the conference room, Lira's privacy fields activating to block external monitoring. Kaito opened his data case, revealing cores that looked old—pre-2840 storage technology. Physical media that couldn't be remotely accessed or modified.

"This is from Sol Relay Station," he said. "My friend—ansible technician named Yuki Tanaka—she spent two years copying classified archives without getting caught. Physical backups of every ansible transmission Earth sent and received in the months before silence. The real transmissions. Not the fabricated versions the guild distributed."

He loaded the first core into the room's isolated terminal. Data cascaded across displays.

Ansible traffic logs. Authentication codes. Content summaries. And gaps. Deliberate gaps where classifications had redacted everything except metadata.

"Three days before Earth went silent," Kaito said, his finger tracing the timeline, "Kepler Observatory detected anomalous signals. Non-human origin. Earth's response was immediate. They initiated contact protocols. Attempted communication."

He pulled up the metadata. "First contact attempt: 2840.184.18:00:00. Earth transmitted standard mathematical sequences designed for first contact. Prime numbers. Pi calculations. Mathematical constants that any technological civilization should recognize."

"Did they receive response?"

"Within six hours." Kaito's voice held weight. "Faster than light-speed communication should allow. Which means whoever responded had their own FTL communication technology. Or was already close. Watching."

Lira's hands went cold. "What did they say?"

"That's classified. Even Yuki couldn't access the actual message content. But the metadata shows Earth's ansible network going into emergency mode. Every Guild Master receiving priority briefings. Massive coordination across all hubs. And then—"

He highlighted a specific timestamp. "2840.186.22:00:00. Earth sends the priority-alpha message to all Guild Masters. The one that starts the systematic deception. Three hours later, Earth's ansible goes silent. Not equipment failure. Deliberate shutdown."

"Silence protocol."

"Yes. But look at this." Kaito pulled up another data layer. "Earth's radio transmissions. Light-speed broadcasts. They don't stop at 2840.187. They continue for another six days. Normal traffic. Weather reports. News broadcasts. Cultural programming."

"And then?"

"And then everything stops. Radio. Ansible. Light emissions drop to minimal levels. Earth goes dark in every spectrum." His expression turned haunted. "I was in orbit. I saw it. The entire planet just... dimmed. Like someone flipped a switch and turned off human civilization."

Lira stared at the data. Earth active in radio spectrum for six days after ansible silence. Then complete blackout.

"What happened in those six days?"

"That's what I've been trying to figure out for twenty-seven years." Kaito pulled up his ship's sensor logs. "I recorded everything from orbit. Energy signatures. EM spectrum analysis. Thermal imaging. For six days, Earth looked normal. Population centers active. Power grids operational. Then—"

He triggered the sensor playback. Lira watched Earth's nightside in thermal imaging. Cities glowing with human civilization's heat. Millions of lights. Thirty billion lives.

And then, over the course of fourteen hours, the lights went out. Not all at once. Sector by sector. Grid by grid. Like an organized shutdown.

"It wasn't attack," Kaito said quietly. "Wasn't bombardment or invasion or violence. It was evacuation. Or ascension. Or transcendence. Something organized. Something the population participated in."

"Where did they go?"

"I don't know. My ship's sensors aren't sophisticated enough to detect teleportation or dimensional shifts or whatever technology might allow thirty billion people to disappear without trace." His voice held frustration. "But I know they're gone. And I know the guild has been fabricating Earth's continued existence for forty years to prevent colonies from knowing humanity's origin world was abandoned or destroyed or transformed into something we don't understand."

Lira looked at the evidence. Physical sensor logs showing Earth's systematic shutdown. Ansible metadata showing contact attempt and Guild Master response. Timeline proving Earth survived six days after ansible silence before population disappeared.

And no indication of whether the alien contact was hostile or helpful. Whether Earth chose evacuation to protect colonies or was forced to evacuate by external threat. Whether the danger was real or Earth's paranoid interpretation of incomprehensible contact.

"You said you'd show me if the threat is real," Lira said. "This shows Earth made contact and then disappeared. But it doesn't prove hostile intent. Doesn't prove ansible network is detectable beacon. Doesn't prove the guild's utilitarian calculations are justified."

"No," Kaito admitted. "It doesn't. But it proves Earth believed the threat was real enough to sacrifice themselves. To deliberately go dark. To tell the guild to maintain the deception rather than allow colonies to know they're alone."

"Or it proves they transcended. Ascended. Joined whatever civilization they contacted." Lira gestured at the shutdown sequence. "Organized evacuation could be choice, not coercion."

"Could be. But then why the silence protocol? Why tell the guild to hide the truth? Why engineer wars to keep ansible traffic minimal?" Kaito met her eyes. "If Earth joined benevolent aliens, why leave us behind? Why not invite the colonies? Why forty years of radio silence?"

The questions had no answers. Just implications and uncertainty and terrible possibilities.

The conference room door chimed. Security override codes.

Lira and Kaito looked at each other.

"Guild Master Takada," Lira said.

"Let her in," Kaito replied. "We're going to have this confrontation eventually. Might as well be now, while we have evidence fresh."

Lira deactivated the privacy fields. The door cycled open.

Ryn floated in the entrance, flanked by two guild security officers. Her expression held grief and resignation and determination.

"Senior Operator Voss. Kaito Reeves." Her voice carried Guild Master authority. "By the authority of the Ansible Guild, I'm placing you both under investigative custody for unauthorized access to classified systems and handling of restricted information."

"We're just looking at data," Lira said. "Physical data from Earth. Truth you've been hiding for forty years."

"Truth that will destroy human civilization if it spreads too quickly without context or preparation." Ryn's eyes found the displays showing Earth's shutdown sequence. "You don't have all the pieces. You don't know what was in Earth's final message. You don't know why silence protocol was necessary."

"Then tell us," Kaito challenged. "Explain why thirty billion people disappeared and you've been lying about it for four decades."

Ryn's expression shifted—something like hope. "Come with me. Both of you. Not to holding cells. To the classified archives. Let me show you what's sealed above Guild Master access. Let me show you why Earth made the choice they did."

"And if we refuse?"

"Then I confiscate Kaito's data cores, arrest you both for information security violations, and continue the deception until someone else discovers what you've found." Ryn's voice held exhausted conviction. "This truth is coming out. I've known that since you first discovered the timestamp discrepancies, Lira. I just wanted to control how it emerged. Give colonies time to prepare for what it means."

"Time to prepare for what?" Lira demanded.

"To prepare for the reality that we're not alone. That we're not the apex. That there are things in the galaxy that see ansible technology as threat or resource or beacon to be eliminated." Ryn gestured at the security officers. "Come with me. Let me show you the classified files. Then decide if you still want to expose everything."

Lira looked at Kaito. He gave the smallest nod.

They hadn't been arrested. Not exactly. They'd been invited to see the deepest truth.

Which meant Ryn believed that truth would convince them continued deception was necessary.

Or Ryn had run out of options and was gambling that full disclosure to them might prevent full disclosure to everyone.

Either way, they were about to learn what was classified even above Guild Master access.

What Earth's final message had contained.

Why humanity had been living a lie for forty years.

"Show us," Lira said. "Show us everything. Then we'll decide what the colonies need to know."

Ryn's smile was broken with relief. "Thank you. This way."

They followed her through the ansible station's corridors, toward archives Lira hadn't known existed, carrying evidence that would either justify forty years of deception or condemn it absolutely.

The ansible hummed in the walls. Messages leaped across light-years.

And Lira Voss prepared to learn whether the lies she'd been investigating were the greatest crime in human history or the greatest act of mercy.
