# Chapter 1: Timestamp Discrepancies

The ansible chamber always smelled of ozone and recycled air, a combination Lira Voss had long stopped noticing. She floated in the quantum observation sphere, her neural implants warming at the temples as the ansible came online for the evening transmission cycle. Outside the pressure dome, Kepler-442's twin stars painted the ice rings in shades of amber and rose—beautiful, distant, irrelevant.

Lira's fingers moved through holographic displays with practiced precision, calling up the transmission queue. Forty-seven messages waiting to leap across light-years in the space of a thought. Agricultural reports from New Singapore. Cultural exchange requests from Tau Ceti. Trade negotiations from the Relay. And, as always, three official dispatches from Earth.

She began the sequence she'd performed ten thousand times before. Verify sender authentication. Confirm quantum entanglement stability. Encode the information stream into collapsed wave states. Transmit.

The first Earth message resolved in her visual field: a routine advisory about terraform technology standards. Lira encoded it, felt the ansible's power draw spike as quantum states collapsed and reformed across eighteen light-years of empty space. The message was now simultaneously here and at its destination, existing in all places until observation collapsed it to one.

Beautiful. Precise. Instantaneous.

Except.

Lira paused, her hand hovering over the second Earth message. Something about the first transmission bothered her—a discordant note in a familiar symphony. She called up the metadata, letting the technical details wash over her: transmission originated from Sol Station Ansible-1, timestamp 2880.043.18:22:03 UTC, authentication code valid, quantum signature nominal.

2880.043.18:22:03 UTC.

Her fingers moved before conscious thought caught up, pulling up the verification database. Every ansible message could be checked against physical light-speed transmissions—redundant radio broadcasts sent simultaneously with quantum messages. The radio signals took eighteen years to crawl across the void between Earth and Kepler-442 at lightspeed. The ansible messages arrived instantly. But both should have identical timestamps at origin.

She found the corresponding radio transmission received eighteen years ago, back in 2862. Its timestamp: 2862.043.18:22:03 UTC.

Perfect synchronization. Exactly as it should be.

So why did the ansible message timestamp read 2880 instead of 2862?

Lira's breath caught. She called up the light-delay calculation subroutine, triple-checking her math. Earth to Kepler-442: 18.03 light-years. Current year: 2880. Radio signal received: 2862. Time elapsed: eighteen years. Ansible timestamp should read: 2862.

But it read 2880.

As if the message had been sent today, not eighteen years ago. As if someone had updated the timestamp when they transmitted it through the ansible.

Her pulse hammered against her throat. Lira forced herself to breathe, to think precisely. One discrepancy meant nothing. Equipment error. Data corruption. Simple mistake.

She pulled up the second Earth message. Timestamp: 2880.043.18:22:15 UTC.

The corresponding radio message from eighteen years ago: 2862.043.18:22:15 UTC.

Different timestamp. Same discrepancy.

Lira's hands shook as she navigated through the database, calling up weeks of Earth messages, months, years. Her implants heated painfully as she processed the data flood, building pattern recognition matrices in her augmented visual cortex.

Every Earth message for the past eighteen years showed the same impossible timestamp pattern. Every single one.

"Voss? You running long?" The voice crackled through her chamber's comm system. Darin, the second-shift operator.

Lira's throat closed. She'd been trained by Guild Master Ryn Takada herself—trained to report anomalies immediately, to trust the verification systems, to maintain the sacred accuracy of ansible communication. Years of protocol screamed at her to flag this discrepancy right now.

But Ryn's name appeared in the message logs. Authorization code RT-447. Ryn had approved these transmissions. Had certified their accuracy.

Had Ryn noticed the timestamps?

"Voss?" Darin's voice held impatience now.

"Almost done." The words emerged steady, professional. A lie that tasted like copper in her mouth. "Complex encoding on the New Singapore agricultural data. Give me five minutes."

"Copy. Five minutes."

Lira closed her eyes, neural implants cooling as she disconnected from the ansible's quantum interface. Five minutes. She had five minutes to decide whether to report this, to trust the system she'd served since childhood, to trust Ryn.

Or to dig deeper into something she wasn't supposed to see.

Her brother's face surfaced in memory—Mikhael, three years dead in the Kepler-442/New Singapore war. The war that started because of a message, because of disputed resource claims, because of information transmitted through ansible that contradicted when representatives finally met decades later. Everyone said it was confusion, cultural drift, misunderstanding across distances too vast to bridge.

But what if it was something else?

Lira's fingers moved across her personal terminal, isolating and copying the timestamp data to an encrypted partition. The guild monitored everything, of course. But they monitored for external threats, for sabotage attempts, for security breaches. They didn't monitor for operators investigating their own messages.

Did they?

She completed the evening transmission cycle on autopilot, her mind racing through possibilities. Equipment malfunction—but eighteen years of consistent malfunction? Mass data corruption—but only on Earth messages? Intentional modification—but why? By whom?

The ansible chamber's door cycled open. Lira pushed herself through in the low gravity, nodding to Darin as he floated past. He didn't look at her twice. She was Lira Voss, third-generation guild member, trained by Ryn Takada herself. Above suspicion. Absolutely trustworthy.

She made it to her quarters before the shaking started.

Lira pulled herself to the observation port, staring out at the ice rings and the distant stars. Somewhere out there, eighteen light-years away, was Earth. Humanity's origin. The Sol System. Home to thirty billion people, the cultural and political center of all forty-seven colonies.

What if Earth wasn't saying what they thought it was saying?

What if someone was changing the messages?

She thought about going to Ryn, about presenting the discrepancy and asking for explanation. Ryn would have an answer. Ryn always had answers. Ryn was Guild Master, keeper of ansible integrity, guardian of truth across impossible distances.

But Ryn's authorization code was on those messages.

Lira opened her personal terminal, pulling up the timestamp data she'd copied. Eighteen years of discrepancies. Thousands of messages. All from Earth. All certified accurate by the guild. All with timestamps that couldn't possibly be correct.

Outside her window, Kepler-442's stars traced their eternal dance. In the station below, ansible operators transmitted instantaneous truths across light-years. And somewhere in that beautiful, precise system, something was wrong.

She had two choices. Report the discrepancy and trust the guild's investigation. Or investigate herself, covertly, knowing that questioning the ansible's integrity was heresy and questioning Guild Master Takada was career suicide.

Lira thought of Mikhael. Thought of the war that killed him, started by miscommunication everyone dismissed as inevitable across such distances. Thought of how ansible messages should be perfect, instantaneous, incorruptible.

Should be.

Her fingers moved across the terminal, setting up analysis subroutines to run in background cycles, hidden in routine system maintenance. She'd investigate. Carefully. Quietly. Until she understood what she was looking at.

Until she knew if the ansible—humanity's sacred link across the void—was telling the truth.

Or if truth was the first thing they'd sacrificed.

**Three days later**

The pattern was worse than Lira had imagined.

She floated in her quarters at 0300 hours, surrounded by holographic data that painted her walls in ghostly blue light. Every off-shift hour for three days, she'd been cross-referencing ansible messages against light-speed verifications, building a matrix of discrepancies.

Earth wasn't the only source. But Earth was the worst.

New Singapore showed occasional timestamp drift—minutes, sometimes hours. Acceptable variation. Equipment calibration issues.

Tau Ceti showed similar minor discrepancies. Random. Explainable.

Earth showed eighteen years of perfect timestamp modification. Every message dated to when it was transmitted through ansible, not when it was originally sent. As if someone was systematically updating timestamps before transmission. As if someone was making new messages look like old light-speed confirmations that happened to arrive exactly on schedule eighteen years later.

The implication made her hands cold.

If someone controlled the ansible, they could fabricate history. They could say Earth said anything, and no one could verify it for eighteen years. By the time light-speed confirmation arrived—if it arrived at all—the ansible version would be established truth. Consensus reality.

And if you controlled ansible operations at both ends, you could make the light-speed confirmations match too.

Lira pulled up the transmission logs for the Kepler-442/New Singapore war. The message that started it all: Earth's ruling about resource allocation in the outer colonies. New Singapore had claimed it contradicted an earlier ansible message. Kepler-442 had defended Earth's position. The dispute escalated. Trade embargo. Sanctions. Finally, violence.

Mikhael died in the first wave, when New Singapore blockaded ansible relay traffic.

She found the disputed message. Timestamp: 2877.128.09:17:44 UTC.

Light-speed verification from eighteen years earlier: 2859.128.09:17:44 UTC.

Perfect synchronization.

And yet New Singapore had physical records—carried by relativistic trade ship, arrived a decade after the message—claiming Earth said something different.

Who had been telling the truth? Earth's ansible message, or New Singapore's physical evidence?

Physical evidence took decades to arrive. Ansible messages were instant. By the time physical proof reached anyone, ansible truth was already woven into history, into policy, into the conflicts that killed millions.

Including her brother.

Lira closed her eyes, fighting nausea. If she was right—if someone was modifying ansible messages, fabricating history in real-time—then everything humanity believed about itself was suspect. Every Earth message. Every cultural directive. Every political decision made based on instantaneous quantum communication.

All of it potentially fiction.

But she couldn't be right. The ansible was sacred. The guild was incorruptible. Ryn Takada was her mentor, the woman who'd trained her, who'd taught her that accuracy was the highest virtue.

Unless Ryn knew. Unless this was policy, not corruption. Unless the guild itself—

The door chime made Lira jump so violently she bounced off the wall.

"Lira? It's Ryn. May I come in?"

Ice flooded Lira's chest. She gestured frantically, dismissing the holographic analysis before Ryn could see. The data vanished, leaving only the soft glow of her personal terminal on screensaver mode.

"Come in." Her voice sounded almost normal.

The door cycled open. Ryn Takada floated through, grey hair impeccable in its traditional guild braid, quantum-state markers gleaming silver in the dim light. Her dark eyes held warmth, concern, and something else Lira couldn't name.

"You've been working odd hours," Ryn said gently. "Darin mentioned you seemed distracted during transmission cycles. I wanted to check on you."

Lira's throat closed. Ryn knew. Of course she knew. Guild Master monitored everything.

"I'm fine," Lira managed. "Just having trouble sleeping."

Ryn studied her for a long moment. "You look like I did when I first noticed."

The words hung in the zero-gravity air between them like a confession.

"Noticed what?" Lira whispered.

Ryn's expression shifted—grief, resolve, something that might have been relief. "That the timestamps don't match. That Earth's messages have been... updated."

Lira's world tilted. "You know."

"I'm Guild Master, child. I authorized the modifications." Ryn moved closer, her voice dropping to barely audible. "And before you ask the next question—yes, it's necessary. No, I can't explain why. Not yet. But I need you to trust me. I need you to stop investigating and trust that what we're doing preserves something more important than perfect accuracy."

"What could be more important than truth?"

The question escaped before Lira could stop it. Ryn's face crumpled, just for a moment, before the Guild Master's mask returned.

"Survival," Ryn said softly. "Civilization. The fragile peace between forty-seven colonies that could shatter in an instant if certain truths emerged too soon." She reached out, gripped Lira's shoulder. "Trust me. Please. For your brother's memory. For everything I taught you."

Lira stared at her mentor. At the woman who'd trained her to value accuracy above all else. Who was now asking her to ignore the biggest accuracy failure in ansible history.

"Stop investigating," Ryn repeated. "That's an order from your Guild Master. And advice from someone who cares about you."

She left before Lira could respond.

Lira floated alone in her quarters, Ryn's words echoing in the silence. *Survival. Civilization. Certain truths.*

What truth was worth hiding? What truth could justify modifying history itself?

And if Ryn had authorized the modifications, who else knew? How deep did this go?

Lira pulled up her encrypted files, staring at eighteen years of impossible timestamps. She should stop. Obey her Guild Master. Trust the system that had shaped her entire life.

Instead, she began expanding her search. If Earth's messages were being modified, she needed to know why. She needed to find the original, unmodified versions. She needed to know what Earth was really saying.

Or if Earth was saying anything at all.

The ice rings turned outside her window. Ansible messages leaped across light-years, instantaneous and perfect and false. And Lira Voss, third-generation guild member, began investigating the one institution she'd been raised to trust absolutely.

Knowing that if she was right, everything humanity believed was a lie.

And if she was wrong, her career—her life—was over.

The ansible hummed in the walls, sending truth and lies at the speed of thought.

Lira chose to find out which was which.
