# Chapter 4: Memorial

Mikhael's death anniversary fell on day 2880.058—twelve days after Lira first discovered the timestamp discrepancies. Three years since her brother died in a war based on lies.

Lira floated in the station's memorial chamber, a small dome at the ansible hub's outer ring where colonists came to remember those lost across impossible distances. Holographic candles flickered in the zero gravity, their light catching on memorial plaques for the dead. Thousands of names. Kepler-442 had lost 47,000 people in the war with New Singapore.

Mikhael Voss. Supply transport pilot. Age 28. Died when New Singapore forces blockaded ansible relay traffic, cutting Kepler-442 off from the communication network for six weeks. His transport had been carrying medical supplies to the ansible station. New Singapore ships fired without warning.

Lira had been here, in this ansible hub, when it happened. Had been operating the same quantum chamber she worked in now. Had felt the network go dark when New Singapore cut the relay connection. Had known, with horrible precision, that Mikhael's route would take him directly through the blockade zone.

She'd calculated his trajectory. His fuel consumption. The exact moment when his fusion torch would make him visible to New Singapore sensors. The second when electromagnetic pulse would disable his transport, leaving him drifting in the void with no power, no heat, no hope.

Forty-three minutes of life support remaining. She'd known exactly how long he had.

And she'd been forbidden to warn him. Communication blackout. Ansible regulations. No transmissions during network compromise.

She'd obeyed the rules and let her brother die.

"Thought I'd find you here."

Lira turned. Ryn floated in the chamber entrance, her guild master robes dark against the memorial's soft light.

"Guild policy is to observe personal grief days," Lira said, her voice hollow. "I have until 1800 hours before I'm required to return to duty."

"I'm not here as Guild Master." Ryn moved closer, her expression pained. "I'm here as someone who cares about you. Who remembers what you were like before Mikhael died. Before the war made you into this."

"Into what?"

"Into someone who sees patterns everywhere. Who can't trust anything. Who thinks everyone is lying." Ryn's voice softened. "Into someone who's destroying herself looking for reasons when sometimes there aren't any. Sometimes terrible things just happen."

Lira pulled up her personal terminal, her hands moving before conscious thought could stop her. Data bloomed in the memorial chamber's quiet air.

"Kepler-442/New Singapore war began on 2877.128," she said, her voice clinical. "Disputed message about resource allocation. Earth supposedly ruled in Kepler-442's favor. New Singapore claimed they had physical evidence Earth said the opposite. Neither side would compromise because both believed they had Earth's authority."

"Lira—"

"I've spent twelve days analyzing that disputed message." Lira's fingers pulled up the ansible logs, overlaying them on Mikhael's memorial plaque. "The original message from Earth, sent via ansible to both colonies: 'Resource disputes between colonies should be resolved through direct negotiation without Earth intervention.'"

She highlighted the modified version received at Kepler-442: "Resource allocation in contested systems defaults to Kepler-442 priority as primary development colony."

And the version received at New Singapore: "Resource allocation in contested systems defaults to New Singapore authority as primary trade hub."

Three different messages. All authenticated as coming from Earth. All with valid quantum signatures and Guild Master approval codes.

"We were both wrong," Lira said. "Kepler-442 and New Singapore were both lied to. Earth never took a side because Earth didn't send any of those messages. Someone modified them. Deliberately. To create incompatible positions that would make war inevitable."

Ryn's face had gone gray. "Where did you—"

"Zara Kim brought me New Singapore's ansible archives." Lira met her mentor's eyes. "She's been investigating for two years. Found the same modifications I found. Compared notes. The pattern is irrefutable. Someone engineered this war. Someone wanted forty-seven thousand people on Kepler-442 and sixty thousand on New Singapore to die."

"It's more complicated than—"

"Mikhael died because someone changed a message." Lira's voice cracked. "I calculated his trajectory. I knew he'd fly into that blockade. I could have warned him. But I followed ansible regulations. Followed the rules. Trusted that the system was accurate. Trusted that communication blackouts existed for good reasons."

She pulled up another data layer. "I've analyzed seven major colonial wars in the past forty years. All of them started with disputed ansible messages. All of them show the same pattern of modifications creating incompatible positions. Kepler-442/New Singapore. Proxima Centauri trade conflict. Tau Ceti sovereignty dispute. All engineered."

"To prevent worse conflicts," Ryn said quietly. "To maintain controlled tension instead of chaotic violence."

The admission hung in the memorial chamber like a condemnation.

"You're saying Mikhael's death was acceptable?" Lira's hands trembled. "That engineering wars is better than—than what? What could possibly be worse?"

"Total war." Ryn's voice held exhausted conviction. "Unrestricted conflict between colonies with no shared authority to prevent escalation. Seven controlled wars over forty years versus potential civilization-destroying conflict between forty-seven independent systems with no common truth."

"Based on what threat? What justifies this?"

Ryn was silent for a long moment, her eyes on Mikhael's memorial plaque. "You found the 2840 shift date. The priority-alpha message from Earth. The pattern change when systematic modification began."

"Yes."

"Did you find what Earth discovered?" Ryn's voice dropped to barely audible. "What made every Guild Master agree that controlled deception was better than chaotic truth?"

"Alien signals," Lira said. "First contact. Something that made Earth implement silence protocol and shut down to hide from detection."

Ryn's expression flickered—surprise, resignation, something like relief. "Zara told you."

"Zara gave me the observatory data. Signal detection. Non-human origin. Earth's contact protocol initiation. And then silence." Lira pulled herself closer to her mentor. "Tell me I'm wrong. Tell me this is paranoid conspiracy theory."

"I can't." Ryn looked old suddenly, ancient despite her sixty years. "Because you're right. Earth made contact forty years ago. And what they learned—what we all learned in that priority-alpha message—made lying to everyone seem like the safer option."

"What did they learn?"

"That we're not alone. That the galaxy has rules we didn't know about. That quantum ansible technology is detectable across vast distances to civilizations with the right sensors. That broadcasting our presence through ansible network made us visible to things we didn't want finding us."

Lira's breath caught. "What things?"

"That's classified at levels even Guild Masters don't fully access." Ryn's voice held frustration. "Earth's final message gave us enough to understand the danger. Not enough to understand the solution. Just instructions: maintain ansible network for colonial coordination but minimize traffic to reduce detection profile. Fabricate Earth's continued presence to prevent colonial collapse. Create controlled tensions to prevent true wars that would require massive ansible coordination."

"So you engineered smaller wars to prevent bigger ones."

"We engineered contained conflicts to prevent unrestricted violence that would light up the ansible network like a beacon." Ryn gestured at Mikhael's plaque. "Forty-seven thousand deaths here. Sixty thousand at New Singapore. Horrible. Unforgivable. But measured against potential extinction if something out there traces our ansible transmissions to every human colony simultaneously..."

"You're saying Mikhael died to keep humanity hidden."

"I'm saying your brother died in a war we started to prevent the kind of desperation that would make colonies scream for help across the entire ansible network. That would make us bright and loud and detectable to whatever made Earth go silent."

Lira wanted to argue. To rage. To call Ryn a monster for engineering wars and justifying genocide through utilitarian calculation.

But the logic held. Horrible, ruthless logic.

If ansible technology was detectable beacon. If human colonies broadcasting constantly made them visible to hostile forces. If reducing ansible traffic meant lower detection profile. Then creating controlled tensions that kept colonies focused on each other instead of calling to Earth for help would minimize network usage.

Would keep humanity quiet.

Would keep them hidden.

"Earth didn't just go silent," Lira said. "They sacrificed themselves. Cut off all communication to protect the colonies."

"We don't know what happened to Earth." Ryn's voice held grief that sounded genuine. "The priority message said they were implementing contact protocols. That they'd made breakthrough with whoever they detected. That the contact attempt had failed—catastrophically. That they were shutting down ansible to prevent tracing. That we should maintain normal operations appearance while minimizing actual traffic."

"And you've been doing that for forty years. Fabricating Earth's messages. Engineering conflicts. Killing millions to prevent billions from dying."

"Yes." No justification. No excuse. Just admission.

Lira looked at her brother's name on the memorial wall. Mikhael, who died following orders. Who trusted the system. Who believed ansible communications were truth.

"There's a trader arriving in two weeks," she said. "Kaito Reeves. He was at Earth when they went silent. Has physical data from Sol Relay Station."

"I know." Ryn's expression turned weary. "We've been tracking his ship for twenty-three years. Knew he'd come here eventually. Knew he'd bring evidence we can't fabricate away."

"You're going to arrest him."

"I'm going to try to make him understand why the lie is necessary. Same thing I'm trying to do with you." Ryn gripped Lira's shoulder. "Child, I know this is horrible. I know the cost is monstrous. But the alternative—letting colonies know Earth is gone, that we're alone, that something out there is dangerous enough to make our origin world sacrifice itself—that truth will destroy us. Not through external threat but through internal collapse."

"Or it will unite us."

"Against what? We don't even know what the threat is. Just that it exists. That it's dangerous. That Earth chose silence over contact." Ryn's voice held desperate conviction. "Fear of unknown enemy won't unite humanity. It will fracture us. Make us paranoid. Make us loud as we argue and prepare and scream into the void demanding answers."

"Make us detectable."

"Exactly." Ryn pulled herself to face Lira directly. "I need you to understand. Not to agree. Just to understand why we made these choices. Why I authorized the modifications. Why I ordered your brother into that supply run knowing it would put him in the blockade zone."

The admission made Lira's vision white.

"You knew," she whispered. "You knew Mikhael would die."

"I knew the war needed casualties to feel real. To justify the conflict and contain it. I knew..." Ryn's voice broke. "I knew sacrificing individual lives was preferable to risking the entire ansible network going loud with cries for Earth's help that would never come."

Lira's hands moved before thought. Shoved Ryn hard enough to send them both spinning in zero gravity. Collision with the memorial chamber wall. Pain blooming across her shoulders.

"You murdered him," Lira said. "Not New Singapore. Not the war. You. You sent him there to die."

"Yes." Ryn steadied herself against the wall, making no move to defend or retreat. "I did. And I'll carry that weight for the rest of my life. Just like I carry the weight of sixty-three other operators across all forty-seven colonies who I've made complicit in this deception. Just like I carry the names of every person who died in the conflicts we engineered."

"How do you live with it?"

"I don't sleep well." Ryn's smile was broken. "I remember every face. Every name. Every modification I authorized. Every war I started. Every time I chose stability over truth. And I know—I know—that the moment you expose this, the moment the truth spreads, ansible traffic will surge. Colonies will demand answers. Demand proof. Demand Earth's response. And we'll light up like a star, visible to whatever Earth was hiding from."

"Maybe that's better than this."

"Maybe." Ryn's expression held something like hope. "Or maybe there's a third option. Maybe when Kaito arrives, when you have his physical evidence combined with your ansible analysis, maybe you'll find a way to expose the necessary parts of truth while protecting the dangerous parts. Show the guild's deception without revealing why. Give colonies the information war without the existential threat."

"That's still lying."

"It's choosing which truths to tell." Ryn pushed off from the wall, drifting toward the chamber exit. "Think about it. You have two weeks before Kaito arrives. Two weeks to decide if perfect truth is worth potential extinction. Or if selective truth might save everyone."

She paused in the doorway. "I'm sorry about Mikhael. Truly. If I could have saved him without risking everything else, I would have. But I couldn't. And I made the choice I thought would protect the most people."

"The choice that made you a murderer."

"Yes." Ryn's voice held acceptance. "That too."

She left Lira alone in the memorial chamber, surrounded by names of the dead and the weight of impossible choices.

Lira stared at her brother's plaque. Mikhael, who believed in rules and duty. Who trusted the system. Who would have understood Ryn's logic even while dying because of it.

Would he have wanted her to expose everything? Or would he have agreed with Ryn that some lies protect more than truth?

Lira didn't know. Couldn't know. Mikhael was dead, and she couldn't ask him.

But she could ask someone who was alive. Someone who'd been at Earth. Who'd witnessed whatever made humanity's origin world go silent.

Kaito Reeves would arrive in thirteen days.

And Lira would be ready with questions that needed answers—even if those answers destroyed everything.

The memorial candles flickered in the recycled air. The ansible hummed in the walls. And Lira Voss mourned her brother while preparing to betray everything he'd believed in.

Or perhaps to honor it by demanding the truth he'd never gotten.
