# Chapter 9: Countdown

Seventy-two hours until Threadkeeper arrival.

Unified human command established temporary headquarters on The Relay. Neutral ground. Neither Contact nor Memory territory. The ansible network's heart—soon to die—now hosting humanity's most important negotiation.

Commander Chen, Admiral Webb, Dr. Zara Kim, and representatives from all forty-seven colonies gathered. Virtual conference impossible once ansibles shut down. Physical presence required.

"Final review," Chen began. "Threadkeepers arrive in three days. What's our negotiation strategy?"

Zara pulled up the assessment. "Core position: We acknowledge ansible risk. We've already reduced usage 73%. We're prepared to shut down. But we demand physical evidence before irreversible choice. Show us Harvester remains. Show us destroyed ansible civilizations. Show us something we can verify independently."

"And if they refuse?" someone asked.

"Then we question their motives," Webb said. "Benevolent rescuers provide evidence. Authoritarians demand trust. We determine which they are based on response to verification demand."

"What if they provide evidence but it's fabricated?"

"We've prepared verification protocols," Zara said. "Material analysis. Age dating. Quantum signature authentication. We can detect fabrication if they attempt it."

"What if evidence is real but doesn't prove Harvesters exist? What if Threadkeepers destroyed previous civilizations themselves and are framing Harvesters?"

Silence fell. Because that was the nightmare scenario. Rescuers who were actually predators. Help that was actually harm.

"If evidence suggests that," Chen said slowly, "we resist. All forty-seven colonies. Unified defense. We die fighting rather than comply with our own extinction."

"Which means we need consensus recognition," Webb added. "All colonies must evaluate evidence and reach same conclusion. We can't have Contact seeing proof while Memory sees fabrication. Split evaluation restarts war."

"Agreed. Evidence evaluation will be transparent. All colonies. All scientists. All perspectives. Consensus or continued uncertainty. No unilateral decisions."

Forty-eight hours until arrival.

Personal preparations began.

Zara recorded message to unknown recipients:

"If you're watching this, first contact went badly. Either Threadkeepers killed us, or Harvesters arrived early, or something unexpected happened. I want you to know: We tried to verify. We tried to demand evidence. We tried to maintain human sovereignty while accepting necessary help. Whatever happened, we didn't comply blindly. We didn't resist stupidly. We negotiated honestly. Remember that. Remember we tried to choose informed. Even if choice killed us."

Chen recorded similar message. Webb recorded his own. All three preparing for death while hoping for survival.

Standard practice for existential negotiation.

Twenty-four hours until arrival.

Ansible traffic spiked as families transmitted final messages. Just in case first contact went badly. Just in case Threadkeepers were predators instead of rescuers. Just in case this was humanity's last shared moment.

The ansible that had lied, manipulated, enabled war, and fractured civilization—now enabling final intimacies.

Mother to daughter: "I love you. Ansible or no ansible. Connected or separated. Alive or dead. I love you."

Veteran to enemy veteran: "We fought over ansible. Killed each other over shutdown question. Now we wait together for aliens who might make our war meaningless. Either we were right to care about ansible, or we wasted eight million lives arguing over technology that was doomed anyway. Either way: I forgive you for fighting me. I hope you forgive me for fighting you. We were both wrong. We should have talked instead."

Lira's family to her ghost: "You're still out there. Still traveling. Still decades from home. You'll outlive us. You'll return to humanity that chose ansible shutdown without your verification. We hope you understand. We hope you approve. We hope the choice you died enabling was right one. We love you. We remember you. Come home safe. Someday."

Twelve hours until arrival.

Detection confirmed. Twelve ships at edge of solar system. Approaching at relativistic speeds. Decelerating in ways that violated known physics.

Magic made technology. Technology become magic.

Humanity watched the most advanced civilization they'd encountered approach for first contact.

Six hours until arrival.

The ships were visible now. Organic hulls. Living vessels. Architecture that breathed. Technology humans couldn't begin to comprehend.

Fear mixed with wonder. Terror mixed with hope. Dread mixed with curiosity.

First contact. The moment every species imagined. The moment that would define human future.

Rescue or extinction.

Help or conquest.

Truth or lies.

In six hours, humanity would know.

One hour until arrival.

Zara ran final signal analyses. "Their communication is different from three years ago. More complex. More nuanced. Like they've learned our language and are preparing sophisticated dialogue."

"Or preparing sophisticated deception," Webb said.

"Both. Maybe." Zara pulled up comparison. "Three years ago their messages were simple: 'Danger. Shutdown. Help.' Now they're transmitting in human linguistic structures. Cultural references. Philosophical frameworks. They've studied us. They know how we think. That's either respect or manipulation."

"We find out which in one hour."

Thirty minutes until arrival.

The ships materialized—not emerged, materialized—at The Relay's coordinates. No transition. No approach. Just sudden presence.

Twelve vessels surrounding ansible station. Humanity's negotiators surrounded by technology that could eliminate them instantly.

"Incoming transmission," comms announced.

Everyone held breath.

The message appeared. Not download. Not information dump. Simple text:

*We are Threadkeepers. We maintain the silence that preserves. You are quantum children endangered by your discovery. We have come to negotiate. Send representatives. We will provide evidence. We will answer questions. We will respect your verification needs. But understand: Delay is risk. Decision is necessary. We begin dialogue.*

Chen looked at Webb. Webb looked at Zara. Zara looked at assembled colony representatives.

"They said they'll provide evidence," someone noted.

"They also said delay is risk. That's pressure for fast decision."

"But they acknowledged verification needs. That's respect for our position."

"Or manipulation to appear respectful."

Chen stood. "Only one way to know. Webb, Zara, we're going. Colony representatives stay here. If we don't return, assume bad faith and prepare defenses. If we return with evidence, evaluate it honestly. Either way, humanity learns truth."

Admiral Webb nodded. Dr. Zara Kim gathered her verification equipment.

Three humans prepared to board alien vessel.

To demand evidence.

To verify claims.

To determine if rescue species was honest.

To represent forty-seven colonies.

To make first contact.

On behalf of humanity-that-broadcasts.

Soon to be humanity-that-survived.

Or humanity-that-refused.

Or humanity-that-was-silenced.

In minutes, they would know which.

The shuttle launched.

Humanity watched.

And waited.

For truth.

For evidence.

For verification.

For whatever came next.
