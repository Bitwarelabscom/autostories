# Chapter 15: The Years Between

Between Chapter 14's demand for verification and Chapter 17's first contact, years passed.

Years of ansible reduction. Years of preparation. Years of Lira traveling. Years of humanity learning who they'd become in silence.

Year One After Confession:

Ansible traffic down to 15% of original levels. Only essential communication. Emergency coordination. Scientific data. Personal messages at minimum priority.

Colonies adapting to silence. Learning to function independently. Discovering they could survive without instant consultation.

Cultural drift measured for first time. Language variations. Political divergence. Social norms shifting. Small changes. Barely noticeable. But present.

The isolation they feared—beginning before shutdown even completed.

Year Two:

Lira transmitted update from deep space. Still traveling. Still gathering intelligence. Still years from destination.

*Threadkeepers have shown me seventeen previous ansible civilizations. I've seen the saved ones' testimony. I've seen the extinct ones' remains. Harvesters are real. Evidence is conclusive. But rescue species isn't purely benevolent. They enforce silence to protect themselves as much as us. Accept help. But negotiate terms. Don't surrender sovereignty for survival. Honest transaction, not imposed rescue. That's my verification. That's Earth's hope. Choose survival, but choose actively. Not passively. —Lira*

The transmission arrived three years later (light-speed delay plus ansible restrictions). But when it arrived, it validated everything. Harvesters real. Rescue self-interested. Negotiation necessary.

Lira's verification—still years from completion—already proving valuable.

Year Three:

Threadkeeper signals intensified. They were approaching. Not decades away anymore. Years away. Then months.

Human space prepared both scenarios. Welcome committees if negotiation succeeded. Defense networks if it failed.

Extremism decreased. Most humans accepting shutdown was necessary. Most understanding rescue was flawed but real. Most choosing informed survival over prideful extinction.

But not all. Never all. Some Memory faction extremists still believing Harvesters were myth. Some Contact faction extremists still believing shutdown should have happened years ago. Minorities, but violent minorities.

Three thousand dead to extremist attacks over three years. Terrible toll. But compared to eight million in previous three years of war—progress.

Compromise saving millions even as it cost thousands.

Year Four:

Children born after Earth's confession didn't remember ansible at full capacity. For them, limited communication was normal. Isolation was expected. Silence was future they'd always known was coming.

New generation inheriting transformed humanity. Not better or worse. Different. Adapted. Preparing for isolation as fact of life rather than loss to mourn.

Silver lining of slow transition.

Year Five:

Threadkeepers detected at edge of human space. Not arrived yet. But close. Months away.

Ansible reduction accelerated. Down to 7% of original capacity. Barely functional network. Emergency-only communication.

Colonies practicing complete silence. Days-long blackouts. Testing if they could function without ansible before being forced to.

They could. Barely. But possible.

Alternative communication networks 85% operational. Light-speed laser relays. Physical message drones. Radio networks. Everything pre-ansible humanity had used. Everything post-ansible humanity would use again.

Year Six:

Lira transmitted final update before Threadkeeper arrival in human space.

*I'm fifteen years into journey. Nine years subjective. I've documented everything. Threadkeeper civilization is ancient. Peaceful. Dedicated to silence enforcement. They've done this seventeen times. They're efficient. Honest. Self-interested. They will demand shutdown. They will provide evidence. They will negotiate timeline. They will enforce if necessary. Accept their help. Verify their claims. Then comply. It's right choice. Hard choice, but right. I'll continue to their coordinates. Will document more. Will return in decades with complete verification. But don't wait for me. Choose now. Choose informed. Choose survival. I verified. You choose. Be human. Survive. —Lira*

Final transmission from woman who'd been traveling fifteen years. Who'd given up home, life, future to verify truth. Who was telling humanity: I verified everything. Now you choose.

Permission to move forward without her.

Blessing to choose survival.

Verification that sacrifice was worth it.

Year Seven:

Threadkeepers arrived.

Twelve ships materializing at New Singapore system.

Not emerged from FTL. Materialized. One moment empty space. Next moment, alien vessels.

And humanity, after seven years of preparation, was ready.

To negotiate.

To verify.

To choose.

Together.

The years between confession and contact had transformed them.

From divided factions to unified species.

From skeptical resistance to informed preparation.

From warfare to compromise.

From imposed choices to active decisions.

Lira had died buying them these years.

Earth had died buying them forty years before that.

Now humanity spent those years wisely.

Preparing for honest transaction with self-interested rescuers.

Preparing to verify before complying.

Preparing to choose survival on their terms.

Not passive acceptance.

Active choice.

Informed decision.

The years between had made them ready.

For whatever came next.

For first contact with species that would define their future.

For choice that would scatter them across light-years.

For silence that would preserve them.

Ready.

Together.

Human.

The way they'd always been.

The way they'd remain.

Even in silence.

Even scattered.

Even isolated.

Human-plural.

Forty-seven varieties.

Choosing survival.

Actively.

Together.

One last time.
