# Chapter 16: The Relay's Last Days

Six months remained until ansible shutdown. Humanity had voted. Threadkeepers had arrived. Evidence had been verified. Choice had been made.

Now came implementation.

The Relay—ansible network's heart—would be last station to go dark. Until every other ansible shut down, The Relay maintained coordination. Transmitted final messages. Enabled last moments of instantaneous human connection.

Station Master Chen walked the corridors one final time.

"Forty years," she said to no one. "Guild operated ansible for forty years. Lied for most of them. Told truth for a few. Now we shut down the lies and the truth together."

The ansible control room hummed with final traffic. Colonies saying goodbye. Families transmitting last messages. Scientists sharing final data. Everyone using remaining months to close what couldn't be reopened.

"Traffic analysis," Chen called.

"Ninety-three percent personal communication," an operator reported. "Five percent scientific. Two percent political. People using ansible to talk to people. Not governments using ansible to coordinate. Return to purpose."

"Purpose it never should have left."

Chen pulled up guild archive. Forty years of message modification. Timestamp alterations. History fabrication. All of it documented. All of it preserved. All of it acknowledged.

"We'll transfer archive to all colonies before shutdown," she said. "Every lie. Every alteration. Every fabrication. Complete transparency. If humanity's going to be scattered, let them be scattered with truth."

"Why preserve the lies? Why not delete them?"

"Because lies taught us what truth costs. Because fabrication showed us what honesty requires. Because forty years of deception proved that transparency, even painful transparency, is only sustainable path." Chen highlighted the archive. "We preserve this so future generations remember: Information control is tyranny. Even well-intentioned tyranny. Even successful tyranny. Still tyranny."

Five months remaining.

Children visited The Relay on school trips. Last generation to see ansible operational. Last humans to experience instant cross-stellar communication before it became history.

"What was it like?" a child asked Chen during tour. "When you could talk to anyone instantly? Across light-years?"

"Magic," Chen said. "Pure magic. You'd transmit message to New Singapore—eighteen light-years away—and receive response in seconds. Not decades. Seconds. Like they were next door instead of decades away. Like distance didn't matter. Like humanity was unified despite being scattered."

"Why do we have to shut it down?"

"Because magic attracted monsters. Because instant communication made us detectable to things that hunt instant communication. Because staying connected meant dying connected. Better to be alive and separated than dead and unified."

"Does it hurt? Shutting down?"

Chen looked at this child who'd never known full ansible capacity. Who'd grown up with reduced traffic. Who'd inherit silence as norm.

"Yes. It hurts. Like cutting off limb to save body. Like abandoning friend to save family. Like choosing necessary loss over chosen extinction. It hurts. But hurt is better than dead. Separated is better than extinct."

Four months remaining.

Guild operators began decommissioning training. How to shut down ansible without damaging quantum infrastructure. How to preserve technology while eliminating function. How to silence without destroying.

"We're becoming obsolete," one operator said during training. "When ansible shuts down, guild ends. We're training for our own unemployment."

"We're training for humanity's survival," Chen corrected. "Guild's forty years of lies proved we shouldn't have this power anyway. Information gatekeepers become information manipulators. Better to eliminate the role than continue trusting flawed humans with absolute communication control."

"What will we do after?"

"After, we're historians. Archivists. Teachers. We preserve knowledge of ansible technology so future generations can understand what we had and why we chose to lose it. We document shutdown so they know it was choice, not defeat. We maintain record so truth outlives us."

Three months remaining.

Traffic shifted. Less goodbye messages. More final coordination. Colonies establishing post-shutdown protocols. How to govern without instant communication. How to maintain trade without coordination. How to remain recognizably human without shared now.

Some colonies optimistic. "We'll send physical messages. Light-speed communication. Physical visits eventually if we develop better drives. Silence isn't forever. Just until we find FTL or until Harvesters are no longer threat."

Others pessimistic. "This is permanent. Once scattered, we'll drift. Language divergence. Cultural evolution. Genetic isolation. In thousand years, we won't recognize each other as same species. Forty-seven human variations. None remembering unified origin."

Both might be right.

Two months remaining.

Threadkeepers offered ongoing guidance. "After shutdown, we remain nearby. We monitor for reactivation attempts. We assist with alternative communication development. We ensure silence maintains."

"Surveillance," someone said bitterly.

"Protection," Tal-Kesh corrected. "For you. For us. Ansible reactivation endangers everyone. We ensure no colony resurrects threat. Honest enforcement. Openly stated. Not hidden. Not pretended as benevolence. We watch because we cannot afford not to watch."

One month remaining.

Final ansible transmissions scheduled. Every colony. Every station. Coordinated shutdown. The Relay last.

Chen received message from Kepler-442. From Lira's family.

*To The Relay and all who maintain ansible's final days: Our daughter died for verification. Our species chose shutdown after verifying. Her sacrifice enabled informed choice. We're grateful. We're proud. We're grieving. When ansible goes dark, tell her story. Preserve her name. Remember that humans chose verification over compliance, truth over convenience, informed agency over imposed survival. Remember Lira Voss chose this for us. Remember we chose this because of her. Remember. —Voss Family, Kepler-442*

Chen preserved the message. Transmitted it across network. Let all forty-seven colonies read it.

Lira's legacy. Earth's sacrifice. Humanity's choice.

All connected. All honored. All remembered.

One week remaining.

The Relay prepared for final shutdown. Ansible would go dark. Station would remain operational—it had other functions. But quantum entanglement communication would end.

Chen stood in control room and watched the countdown.

Seven days until humanity scattered.

Seven days until silence began.

Seven days until forty-seven colonies became forty-seven futures.

Connected briefly. Isolated forever.

The ansible that had been weapon, tool, lie, truth, burden, gift—ending.

On humanity's terms.

After verification.

After choice.

After everything Lira died enabling.

Everything Earth died buying time for.

Everything humanity had earned through compromise, verification, honest negotiation.

The ansible's last days.

Humanity's first days in silence.

Both beginnings and endings.

Both necessary.

Both chosen.

The way it always should have been.
