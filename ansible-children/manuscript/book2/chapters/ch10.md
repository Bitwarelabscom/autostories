# Chapter 10: Questions and Answers

The Threadkeeper vessel interior was alive.

Walls that breathed. Floors that shifted to accommodate movement. Air that felt filtered through living tissue. Everything organic-technological hybrid. Everything impossible by human understanding.

Weaver Tal-Kesh met them in chamber that might have been conference room or might have been organism's interior cavity. Hard to tell.

"Commander Chen. Admiral Webb. Dr. Kim. You speak for humanity-that-broadcasts. We speak for Threadkeepers-that-silence. Let us exchange truth."

Zara was first to speak. "You said you'd provide evidence. Show us."

"Direct. Efficient. Human." Tal-Kesh gestured. The walls shifted, became display. "Evidence begins with history."

The display showed star systems. Ansible activations across a thousand years. Seventeen signatures lighting up, one by one. Then disappearing. Seventeen civilizations that had broadcast, then gone silent.

"Seventeen ansible civilizations in past millennium," Tal-Kesh explained. "Each activated ancient quantum network. Each attracted two responses: Threadkeepers offering rescue. Harvesters enforcing elimination. Race between salvation and extinction. We saved eleven. Six refused shutdown until too late. Harvesters eliminated them before compliance completed."

"That's testimony," Webb said. "Not evidence. Show us physical remains. Show us Harvester machines. Show us something we can verify."

"We brought verification." The display shifted. The walls opened.

In containment field, floating in zero-gravity: Harvester probe. Intact. Functional. Dead.

Zara approached immediately. Ran every scan she had. Material composition. Age dating. Quantum signatures. Design analysis. Manufacturing traces. Everything.

The probe was real. Ancient. Alien. And configured specifically to detect one thing: ansible transmissions.

"It's authentic," Zara said quietly. "This is Von Neumann machine designed for ansible hunting. Estimated age: at least three thousand years. Probably older. Design principles are non-human. Construction methods unknown to human technology. This is real Harvester scout probe."

"Or something Threadkeepers built to look like Harvester probe," Webb countered.

Tal-Kesh's expression shifted. Something like amusement. "You are skeptical. Good. Skepticism preserves. We offer more evidence."

The containment field expanded. More objects appeared. Fragments of ansible stations. Destroyed colony infrastructure. Biological remains. All preserved, all documented, all telling same story: civilizations that refused shutdown, Harvesters that enforced elimination.

Zara catalogued everything. Hours of analysis. Every test. Every verification. Every authenticity check.

Finally: "This is real. This is physical evidence from destroyed ansible civilizations. Age dates match Threadkeeper timeline. Damage patterns consistent with automated assault. Biological remains are non-human but show intelligence markers. This is evidence of extinct civilizations that used ansible and died for it."

Webb examined the remains himself. "This proves civilizations died. Doesn't prove Harvesters killed them. Could be Threadkeepers killed them and fabricated Harvester explanation."

"We preserve truth, not destroy it," Tal-Kesh said. "Your skepticism is noted. We offer final evidence. Testimony from saved civilizations."

The display changed. Alien faces appeared. Non-human but recognizable as people. Seventeen different species. Eleven speaking.

The translations scrolled:

*"We are Weaver-folk. Activated ansible sixty-three years ago. Threadkeepers arrived. Warned of Harvesters. We verified. Shut down. Survived. Now communicate via light-speed methods. Our civilization continues isolated but alive."*

*"We are Crystal Singers. Activated ansible one hundred forty-seven years ago. Threadkeepers warned. We resisted. Demanded proof. Harvesters arrived during verification. Threadkeepers helped us survive initial assault. We shut down. Civilization traumatized but preserved."*

*"We are Ocean Rememberers. Activated ansible nine years ago. Threadkeepers warned immediately. We trusted. Shut down within weeks. No Harvester contact. Peaceful transition. We accept isolation as price of existence."*

Eleven testimonies. Eleven species. All saying: Threadkeepers warned. Harvesters came or nearly came. Shutdown saved them.

"Can we contact these species?" Chen asked. "Verify their testimonies independently?"

"They are light-years distant. Contact requires decades. But coordinates provided. You may verify when capable." Tal-Kesh transmitted location data. "We hide nothing. We claim nothing that cannot be verified. We respect your need for truth."

Webb studied the data. "Why do you help us? What's your motivation?"

"Self-interest and compassion both." Tal-Kesh's honesty was absolute. "Ansible endangers you. Also endangers us. Quantum network connects all active nodes. Harvesters follow signals to all entangled points. If you broadcast, you lead Harvesters to us. We cannot afford your ansible endangering our survival. So we enforce silence. For your survival. For our survival. For collective survival."

"Enforced salvation," Webb said. "Exactly what we feared."

"Honest salvation," Tal-Kesh corrected. "We do not claim pure altruism. We do not hide self-interest. We state clearly: your silence protects us. Our survival requires your shutdown. We help you survive because it helps us survive. Both goals align. Both species benefit. Is this tyranny if we state it honestly?"

"It's tyranny if we can't refuse," Chen said.

"You can refuse. Six previous civilizations did. They died. Harvesters eliminated them. We tried to save them. Failed because they refused too long. Choice exists. Choose survival or choose extinction. Both are options. But choose knowing consequences."

Zara pulled up the evidence summary. "Commander, Admiral—verification complete. Evidence is authentic. Threadkeeper claims are substantiated. Harvesters exist. Ansible attracts them. Shutdown prevents detection. Testimony from eleven saved civilizations confirms pattern. This is real."

"Real evidence from source with self-interested motivations," Webb noted.

"Yes. And that doesn't make it false." Zara met his eyes. "Rescue species protecting themselves while protecting us—that's acceptable. Flawed benevolence is still benevolence. Self-interested salvation is still salvation."

"What about middle path?" Chen asked Tal-Kesh. "Reduced ansible usage? Limited broadcast? Scheduled darkness? Earth tried to negotiate alternatives. You refused. Why?"

"Because partial shutdown is full risk," Tal-Kesh explained. "Ansible network is quantum-entangled. Any active node broadcasts to all nodes. Any signature detection leads Harvesters to entire network. Partial shutdown is zero protection. Either all nodes silent or all nodes endangered. No middle exists. Physics determines this. Not our preference."

"So it's all-or-nothing."

"Yes. Complete silence or complete vulnerability. We wish middle path existed. Would be easier. Would preserve your unity while ensuring safety. But quantum entanglement allows no compromise. The ancient species that built ansible network designed it this way. Honeypot without escape. Identification system without nuance. You broadcast or you don't. You survive or you don't. Binary choice. We are sorry. But physics is absolute."

Chen looked at Webb. Webb looked at Zara. Zara looked at evidence.

"We need to present this to all colonies," Chen said. "Let everyone evaluate. Reach consensus."

"Time limit exists," Tal-Kesh said. "Harvesters detected your ansible forty years ago. Swarm grows as signal continues. Current ansible reduction helps. But not enough. You have months before swarm becomes unsurvivable. We ask: Evaluate evidence. Make choice. Implement quickly. Delay kills everyone."

"How many months?"

"If complete shutdown within six months: manageable swarm. Perhaps defensive. If delay longer: unsurvivable swarm. Definitely extinction."

"Six months."

"Or less. Faster is safer. But six months is acceptable if absolutely necessary."

The three humans conferred silently.

Evidence was real. Threat was verified. Self-interest was acknowledged. Timeline was firm.

"We take this to humanity," Chen said. "We present evidence transparently. We let all forty-seven colonies evaluate. If consensus is shutdown, we begin immediately. If consensus is uncertain, we discuss further. But choice remains human choice."

"Acceptable," Tal-Kesh said. "We do not demand. We inform. We provide evidence. We answer questions. We respect your verification process. But we do not accept infinite delay. Six months. Then shutdown must complete. For your survival. For our survival. For collective survival."

They returned to human space with evidence.

With verification.

With timeline.

With choice.

And humanity evaluated whether honest tyranny was better than dishonest freedom.

Whether flawed rescue was worth accepting.

Whether survival justified sacrifice.

The answer would define them.

For whatever future remained.
