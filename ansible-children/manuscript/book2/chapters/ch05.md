# Chapter 5: The Vote

Referendum Day.

Across forty-seven colony systems, spanning eighteen to forty light-years from dead Earth, twenty-nine billion humans prepared to answer a single question:

*Shall humanity permanently shut down the ansible network to prevent detection by Harvesters?*

YES or NO.

Survival or connection.

Informed choice or informed refusal.

The voting lasted forty-eight hours to accommodate different colony time zones and democratic processes. Some colonies held direct democracy—every citizen voted. Others used representative systems—elected delegates chose. A few used consensus models—debate until agreement emerged or time ran out.

All methods accepted. All votes counted equally.

One human, one vote. Across impossible distances. Connected by the very technology they were voting to eliminate.

Hour One: Voting begins on Proxima Centauri.

The colony that had fought hardest against Tau Ceti. The colony that had lost four million in three weeks of war. The colony whose citizens remembered what ansible-transmitted lies had cost.

Preliminary results: 67% YES. Shut down ansible. Never again let instant communication enable instant war.

Hour Eight: New Singapore votes.

The ansible hub. The colony whose entire economy depended on traffic management. The colony with most to lose from shutdown.

Results: 48% YES, 52% NO. New Singapore chose connection over safety.

Memory faction celebrated. Contact faction noted: New Singapore was one colony. Forty-six remained.

Hour Sixteen: Kepler-442, Lira Voss's home colony.

Split down the middle during the wars. Fractured between those who believed her and those who called her traitor. The colony where her brother had died in war caused by ansible lies.

Results: 71% YES. Kepler-442 chose to honor Lira's sacrifice by accepting the truth she'd died verifying.

Hour Twenty-Four: The Relay station, ansible network's heart.

Guild operators voting on their own obsolescence. People who'd maintained ansible for forty years. People who'd lied for forty years. People who knew exactly what they were voting to end.

Results: 89% YES. Guild chose honesty over employment. Truth over relevance.

Hour Thirty-Six: Tau Ceti votes.

The colony that had warred with Proxima. The colony that had tried to destroy ansibles by force. The colony most committed to Contact faction's vision.

Results: 82% YES. Tau Ceti validated its war dead by choosing the survival they'd fought for.

Hour Forty-Seven: Final colony reports. Forty-six of forty-seven votes tallied.

Current total: 52.3% YES, 47.7% NO.

Margin: 1.4 billion votes out of 29 billion cast.

Close. Razor-thin. Exactly the dangerous margin that simulations had warned against.

If final colony voted strongly NO, the margin could flip. If final colony voted strongly YES, the mandate could solidify.

Hour Forty-Eight: Final colony results arrive.

New Ganymede. Small colony. Independent-minded. The colony that had proposed individual choice instead of collective decision. The colony most skeptical of majority rule.

Results: 54% YES, 46% NO.

New Ganymede chose shutdown. Barely. But enough.

Final referendum total: 52.3% YES, 47.7% NO.

Humanity voted to shut down ansible.

By the narrowest possible margin.

By a difference that meant thirteen billion humans had chosen silence.

While twelve billion had chosen connection.

And every single one of those twelve billion would be forced to comply with majority decision.

Would lose ansible because others had voted to eliminate it.

Would be silenced because collective survival demanded collective action.

Democracy had spoken.

Barely.

The ansible network erupted in celebration and grief simultaneously.

Contact faction celebrations across twenty-four colonies. Relief that humanity had chosen survival. Gratitude that majority had accepted evidence. Determination to implement shutdown quickly.

Memory faction mourning across twenty-three colonies. Loss of connection they'd tried to preserve. Anger at narrow margin imposing irreversible choice. Resignation that they'd agreed to abide by majority and would honor that agreement.

But also unity. Unexpected unity.

Because forty-seven colonies had voted together. Had debated together. Had chosen together. The ansible that would die had enabled the most important democratic act in human history.

Humanity's last collective decision made through ansible communication.

Humanity's last shared moment before permanent isolation.

Admiral Webb transmitted across network:

"Memory faction accepts referendum outcome. We fought to verify before complying. Humanity has now decided to comply before full verification. We believe this is wrong choice. But it is legitimate choice. Made democratically. Made informed. Made freely. Therefore, we honor it. New Singapore will begin ansible shutdown according to agreed protocols. Memory faction colonies will comply with majority will. Not because we agree. Because we are human. And humans respect democratic choices. Even when we believe democracy chose poorly."

Commander Chen responded:

"Contact faction acknowledges Memory's acceptance. We recognize 47.7% of humanity voted against shutdown. We recognize narrow margin. We commit: If Lira Voss returns with verification that contradicts Harvester threat, we will reconsider. This choice is reversible in principle even if irreversible in practice. Ansible technology will be preserved, not destroyed. If future evidence justifies reactivation, knowledge remains available. We choose shutdown now. But we don't foreclose future choice. If we're wrong, if Memory was right, humanity will know. And will judge accordingly."

Zara Kim transmitted final message before referendum results became action:

"Humanity has chosen. 52.3% to 47.7%. Close enough that everyone should feel uncomfortable. Close enough that we could be wrong. Close enough that 12 billion humans are being silenced against their choice. This is democracy's flaw and strength: Majority rules, minority complies, everyone lives with consequences. To the 52.3%: Be humble. You barely won. To the 47.7%: Be gracious. You nearly won. To all of us: Be ready. We implement this choice together. Shutdown begins in six months. Coordinated. Gradual. Unified. And when it's done, we'll live with this choice. Or die with it. Together."

The voting ended.

The ansible network would die in six months.

But for six months more, humanity stayed connected.

Preparing for separation.

Saying goodbye to instant communication.

Accepting the choice they'd made.

By the narrowest possible margin.

That would define their species forever.
