# Chapter 8: Three Years of Preparation

Three years passed between Chapter 7's compromise and the Threadkeepers' arrival.

Three years of ansible reduction. Of alternative communication development. Of humanity preparing for both cooperation and resistance.

Zara spent those years transforming Contact Research Directorate from ansible-focused institution to light-speed communication hub.

"Laser relay network across forty-seven colonies," she explained to her expanding team. "Messages transmitted at light-speed via focused beams. No quantum entanglement. No Harvester detection. Decades of delay, but secure. Sustainable. Honest."

Her assistant pulled up relay calculations. "New Singapore to Kepler-442: eighteen light-years. Thirty-six year round-trip communication. Conversations become multi-generational."

"Yes. Like they were before ansible. Like they'll be after." Zara designed relay protocols. "Our parents had instant communication for forty years. We're returning to human norm: patience. Acceptance of distance. Letters that outlive their writers."

But the research that mattered most: understanding Threadkeepers.

Three years of analyzing their signals. Decoding their language. Mapping their technology. Preparing for arrival that came closer every day.

"They're biological-technological hybrids," Zara reported to unified human command. "Not cybernetic implants. Actual fusion of living and constructed matter. Their ships grow. Their tools evolve. Their civilization operates on principles we're only beginning to comprehend."

"Can we fight them if necessary?" Admiral Webb asked bluntly.

"No. Their technology is centuries ahead. Maybe millennia. If they want to shut down our ansibles by force, they will. If they want to eliminate us entirely, they could." Zara pulled up power comparisons. "But that's not their pattern. Seventeen previous civilizations: eleven saved, six extinct. The extinct ones refused shutdown and Harvesters eliminated them. Threadkeepers didn't eliminate them for refusing. Threadkeepers tried to save them. Failed because species wouldn't comply before Harvesters arrived."

"Or so Threadkeepers claim," Webb countered. "We have their testimony. Not independent verification."

"Which is why we wait for Lira," Commander Chen said. "She'll verify or disprove Threadkeeper claims. Until then, we prepare for both scenarios."

The preparation was exhaustive.

Contact faction developed ansible shutdown protocols that could be executed within days if Threadkeepers demanded immediate compliance.

Memory faction developed ansible defense networks that could resist enforcement attempts for weeks if humanity chose to fight rather than submit.

Both factions developed diplomatic frameworks for negotiating with species that might not value human sovereignty, democracy, or consent.

"What do we offer them?" a diplomat asked during planning sessions. "What does humanity have that advanced species wants?"

"Nothing," Zara admitted. "We're primitive by their standards. But we have something they need: our silence. Ansible endangers them too. We're not negotiating from strength. We're negotiating from mutual vulnerability. They need us quiet. We need to verify threat before going quiet. That's our leverage."

Three years of ansible reduction showed results.

Traffic down 73% from pre-compromise levels. Colonies adapting to delayed communication. Alternative networks coming online. Humanity learning to function with limited quantum entanglement.

But the reduction revealed unexpected consequence.

Cultural drift accelerated.

Three years of reduced communication. Three years of colonies operating independently. Three years of local decision-making without instant human-wide consensus.

Language patterns diverging. Political systems evolving separately. Cultural norms shifting. Not dramatically. Not obviously. But measurably. The isolation humanity was preparing for—it was already beginning.

And it hurt.

"My cousin on Tau Ceti," a Kepler-442 resident transmitted. "We used to talk weekly. Ansible made that possible. Now with reduced traffic, we talk monthly. Soon we won't talk at all. Already I notice—she uses phrases I don't recognize. References culture I don't share. We're drifting. While still connected. What happens when connection ends completely?"

What happened was human-plural. Forty-seven colonies becoming forty-seven cultures. Inevitable. Permanent. Accelerating.

The price of survival.

Three years also brought assassination attempts.

Memory faction extremists targeting Contact leadership. Contact faction extremists targeting Memory hold-outs. Radicals on both sides believing compromise was betrayal.

Zara survived two attempts. Commander Chen survived three. Admiral Webb survived one but lost advisors to another.

The extremism was minority. Most humans accepted compromise. But minorities could kill. And some believed killing was justified to prevent wrong choice.

"They're murdering each other over position we're still verifying," Webb said bitterly after losing colleagues. "Lira isn't back yet. Threadkeepers haven't arrived yet. Harvesters haven't been confirmed yet. And they're killing each other over incomplete information."

"Fear makes people violent," Chen replied. "They're afraid we're making species-level mistake. Afraid we're choosing wrong. Afraid their children will die because humanity bet poorly. That fear manifests as murder."

"How do we stop it?"

"We can't. We survive it. We wait for verification. We hope Threadkeepers bring evidence that resolves uncertainty." Chen pulled up casualty statistics. "We've lost three thousand to extremist violence in three years. Terrible. But eight million died in first three years of war. Compromise saved millions. That's worth remembering when extremists make us question compromise value."

Three years also brought hope.

Children born after compromise. Raised knowing Threadkeepers were coming. Raised with ansible reduction as norm. Raised expecting verification before irreversible choice.

They didn't remember the wars. Didn't remember when Contact and Memory killed each other. They only knew: adults made compromise, adults waited for evidence, adults prepared for either outcome.

Next generation inheriting better than previous generation left.

Small victory. But real.

Three years of preparation ended with final assessment.

"Threadkeepers arrive in three days," Zara reported to unified command. "Our readiness status:

Ansible shutdown: Can execute in five days if they demand immediate compliance.
Ansible defense: Can resist for three weeks if we choose non-compliance.
Diplomatic framework: Prepared to negotiate from position of mutual interest.
Alternative communication: 63% complete, operational enough to function without ansible.
Species unity: Contact and Memory both committed to presenting unified front.
Verification requirement: All colonies agree—we demand physical evidence before irreversible choice.

We're ready as we can be."

"What if they refuse to provide evidence?" Chen asked.

"Then we learn what they really are," Webb answered. "Benevolent rescuers who respect our verification needs? Or authoritarian enforcers who demand compliance based on trust? Either way, three days until we know."

"And Lira?" someone asked. "Any word?"

"She's been transmitting weekly updates as she travels," Zara said. "Currently nine years into journey. Objective time, six years subjective due to relativistic effects. She's still decades from reaching Threadkeeper coordinates. Still decades from providing independent verification. But she's gathering intelligence along the way. Analyzing Threadkeeper signal patterns. Recording everything for eventual transmission home."

"So we make first contact without her verification."

"Yes. We negotiate based on Threadkeeper testimony and our own analysis. Lira's verification comes later. Much later. But it will come. And if we make wrong choice now, her evidence will tell future generations why. Either way, truth emerges eventually."

Three years of preparation.

Three years of compromise holding.

Three years of humanity learning to function as unified species despite philosophical disagreements.

Three years of cultural drift beginning.

Three years of extremist violence persisting.

Three years of children inheriting better world.

Three years of waiting.

Now waiting ended.

Threadkeepers were arriving.

And humanity was ready.

Not certain. Not unified in belief. Not confident they knew truth.

But ready to negotiate as one species.

Ready to demand evidence.

Ready to verify before complying.

Ready to fight if necessary.

Ready to accept if justified.

Ready for whatever came.

Together.

The way Earth died hoping they'd be.
