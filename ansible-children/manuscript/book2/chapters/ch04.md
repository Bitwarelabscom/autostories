# Chapter 4: Voices

Fourteen days before the referendum, ansible traffic reached its highest volume since the network's creation.

Everyone wanted to be heard.

A terraformer on Kepler-442's second moon recorded her testimony:

"I've spent thirty years making dead rock livable. Transforming poison atmosphere into breathable air. Building ecosystem from nothing. It takes generations. My children will see forests. Their children will see rain. Maybe their children's children will see something resembling Earth. That's the timeline of colony-building. Decades. Centuries. And ansible let us share that progress across colonies. Learn from each other. Adapt techniques. Stay connected to human project of spreading life across galaxy. Without ansible, we're isolated experiments. With it, we're unified endeavor. I vote NO. Not because I deny Harvesters. Because I refuse to abandon human unity without absolute proof threat is real."

A soldier who'd fought in Proxima-Tau Ceti war transmitted from rehabilitation station:

"I lost both legs and my best friend fighting over what Earth supposedly said. Guild lied. We killed each other based on fabrications. Eight million dead before truth came out. Now we're being asked to trust again. Trust rescue species. Trust Harvester testimony. Trust that ansible endangers us. I'm done trusting. I vote NO until I see physical proof. Until Lira returns with verification. Until someone shows me actual Harvester, not transmitted warning about Harvesters. Trust killed eight million of us. I won't let it kill billions more."

But an ansible operator on The Relay transmitted counter-testimony:

"I was part of the guild's deception. I modified messages. Altered timestamps. Maintained Earth's fabrication for fifteen years. I thought I was preserving stability. Preventing panic. Protecting civilization. I was wrong. Lies always collapse. Always cause more damage than truth would have. Now rescue species provides testimony about Harvesters. Maybe it's truth. Maybe it's lies. But here's what I know: If Harvesters are real and we don't shut down, everyone dies. If Harvesters are false and we do shut down, we lose communication but survive. The asymmetry is clear. Wrong choice one direction means inconvenience. Wrong choice other direction means extinction. I vote YES. Because I've seen what happens when we bet wrong. And I won't make that mistake again."

A xenobiologist from New Singapore published open letter:

"I've studied alien life for twenty years. Microbial. Simple. Nothing intelligent. Nothing technological. We thought we were alone. Then ansible brings contact—indirect, through rescue species warnings about Harvesters. Everyone asks: Are Harvesters real? Wrong question. Right question: Why would rescue species lie? What do they gain? They're technologically superior. If they wanted us silent, they'd enforce silence immediately. Instead they warn. Negotiate. Provide evidence. Offer guidance. That's not behavior of conquerors. That's behavior of species who've been through this before. Who know the threat. Who want to help. I vote YES. Because alien contact, even imperfect contact, is gift. And gifts should be accepted, not rejected out of paranoia."

Ten days before referendum, children began transmitting.

A twelve-year-old from Tau Ceti:

"I've never known silence. Ansible existed before I was born. I can talk to my cousin on Proxima instantly. Can access colony libraries across human space. Can watch events across light-years as they happen. Everyone says ansible is only forty years old. For adults, maybe. For me, it's forever. It's what makes us human-together instead of human-separate. Adults remember before ansible. I don't. To me, silence is death. Isolation is horror. I don't want to grow up in universe where I can't talk to my cousin. Where news takes decades. Where human space fragments into incomprehensible colonies. I vote NO. Because the universe you're choosing isn't universe I want to inherit."

A fifteen-year-old from Kepler-442 responded:

"I'm three years older than you. I remember before the war. Before Lira's broadcast. Before eight million died. I remember when ansible meant unity. Now it means division. Conflict. Death. Maybe silence is death to you. To me, ansible is death. Eight million proved it. Maybe eight billion more if Harvesters come. You want to keep ansible because it's comfortable. I want to shut it down because living uncomfortable is better than dying comfortable. I vote YES. Because I want to inherit any universe at all. Even quiet one."

The children's debate went viral. Parents watching their kids argue about futures they'd never share. Some families unified. Some fractured. All of them recognizing: this vote would shape centuries.

One week before referendum, unexpected voice emerged.

Ryn Takada. The guild director who'd maintained Earth's fabrication for forty years. Released from custody to make statement.

"I deceived humanity for four decades. Fabricated Earth's messages. Maintained consensus reality through lies. I did this believing it was necessary. Believing truth would fracture civilization. Believing my deception protected billions. I was right about consequences. Truth did fracture civilization. Eight million died. Wars erupted. Unity collapsed. Everything I predicted happened. But I was wrong about necessity. Lira Voss proved that. She chose truth. She accepted consequences. She gave humanity information and trusted them to choose. I denied humanity that trust. Denied them agency. Denied them right to choose informed. And my denial, my forty-year lie, made the fracture worse. If I'd been honest from the beginning—if I'd revealed Earth's silence immediately—humanity would have had forty years to prepare. Forty years to verify. Forty years to develop alternatives. Instead, I gave them forty years of comfortable ignorance. And when truth came, they were unprepared. Divided. Fragile. This referendum is what I should have called forty years ago. Human-wide vote on existential question. I vote YES. Not because I trust rescue species. Because I don't trust myself. Because I've proven I'm terrible at deciding what humanity needs. So I defer to humanity. Whatever majority chooses, I support. Not because majority is always right. Because collective choice is legitimate even when individual leadership knows better. Especially when individual leadership knows better. Trust humanity. Let them choose. And accept their choice. Whatever it is."

Ryn's statement silenced ansible traffic for six hours. Everyone processing. Former liar advocating trust. Former deceiver advocating choice. Former gatekeeper advocating democracy.

Memory faction claimed it vindicated their position—Ryn admitting she was wrong to impose decisions.

Contact faction claimed it vindicated theirs—Ryn saying she should have acted forty years ago.

Really, it vindicated neither. It just reminded everyone: This choice had weight. History would remember. And everyone voting bore responsibility for outcome.

Three days before vote, the testimonies stopped. Everyone had spoken. Every argument had been made. Every position had been explained.

Now humanity just had to choose.

Based on testimonies from millions.

Based on evidence that pointed both directions.

Based on futures they could barely imagine.

Based on trust they weren't sure they had.

The ansible traffic quieted. Not silence. Just pause. Collective breath before collective choice.

And forty-seven colonies prepared to vote.

On question with no clear answer.

On choice with no safe option.

On future they'd build together.

Or die trying.
