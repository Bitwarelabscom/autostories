# Chapter 7: The Vote

The referendum took four months to organize, two months to conduct, and three hours to destroy.

Zara Kim watched the results cascade across her displays in the Contact Research Directorate. Forty-seven colonies. Twenty-nine billion humans. All voting on a single question:

*Shall humanity permanently shut down the ansible network to prevent detection by Harvesters?*

The numbers stabilized.

**YES (Shut down ansibles)**: 24 colonies, 52.3% of human population

**NO (Maintain ansible network)**: 23 colonies, 47.7% of human population

Humanity had chosen survival by the narrowest possible margin.

Twenty-four colonies would live in isolation. Twenty-three would face extinction together.

Except that wasn't how it worked.

"Incoming transmission," her assistant announced. "Admiral Webb. Memory faction command. Priority urgent."

Zara accepted. Webb's face appeared, and she saw immediately: he knew what she was about to tell him.

"The referendum was about the network," Webb said flatly. "Not individual colonies. Majority says shut down. But my colony—New Singapore—voted to keep our ansible operational. 67% in favor of maintaining connection."

"The referendum was humanity-wide," Zara said carefully. "Collective decision. We all agreed to abide by majority vote."

"We agreed before we knew how close it would be. Before we knew half of humanity would be forced into isolation against their will." Webb pulled up the colony-by-colony breakdown. "New Singapore, Proxima Centauri, Kepler-442, eighteen other colonies voted NO. They want to maintain ansible. And you're going to force them to shut down because other colonies voted YES?"

"That's what majority vote means."

"That's what tyranny of the majority means." Webb's voice was ice. "We gave Earth's vision a chance. Human-wide referendum. Democratic choice. And the result is half of humanity imposing their survival on the other half. The half that would rather risk Harvesters than live in permanent isolation."

Zara felt her stomach sink. She'd seen this coming. They all had. But they'd hoped—

"You're not planning to comply with the vote," she said.

"New Singapore voted 67% to keep our ansible. That's a super-majority of our population. Why should we follow a 52% vote from colonies we'll never meet?" Webb's logic was terrible and perfect. "You want us to voluntarily cut ourselves off from human civilization based on a threat we're not certain exists, overruling our own democratic choice?"

"Earth's final message—"

"Called for informed choice. We chose. Our colony chose. And our choice was connection." Webb leaned forward. "You won the referendum. Congratulations. Twenty-four colonies will shut down their ansibles. But the other twenty-three are keeping ours operational. And if Contact faction tries to force compliance, we'll defend our ansibles by force."

The transmission cut.

Zara sat in silence. Stared at the referendum results.

Humanity had voted for survival.

Half of humanity rejected the vote.

She pulled up communications from other Memory faction colonies. Same message, different voices. Same refusal. The referendum had solved nothing. Just legitimized the split.

"Dr. Kim?" Her assistant's voice was shaky. "Commander Chen is requesting immediate conference. Also... you should see the ansible traffic analysis."

The data appeared. And Zara's breath caught.

Twenty-three colonies still broadcasting ansible signals.

Twenty-four colonies going dark.

And from the darkness between stars, something else. Patterns she'd been tracking for three years. Non-human signals. Alien communication.

Getting closer.

Much closer.

"How long until alien arrival?" she asked.

"Based on signal Doppler shift and intensity increase..." Her assistant's hands shook. "Three years. Maybe less. They're not just out there anymore. They're coming here."

Zara pulled up the alien signal analysis she'd been running since Book 1. The patterns had evolved. Become more complex. More... conversational.

Like they were responding to something.

To ansible traffic.

To humanity's forty years of broadcasting beacon.

She decoded the latest transmission. Alien language patterns she'd spent three years learning. Still partial, still uncertain, but enough to get the meaning.

*Quantum children. We hear you. We are coming. Prepare for refuge. Harvesters detected, estimate 71 years arrival your position. Shutdown protocols must begin immediately. Cannot negotiate. Cannot delay. Help is not optional.*

"Oh god," Zara whispered.

"Ma'am?"

"The aliens aren't offering refuge. They're imposing it." She pulled up the full signal analysis. "This isn't 'come meet us if you want.' This is 'we're coming to save you whether you consent or not.' They're detecting our ansible signals, tracking Harvester approach, and..." She traced the trajectory. "They're not heading to Lira and Kaito's coordinates. They're coming to human space. To us. To shut down our ansibles by force if necessary."

Her assistant paled. "Memory faction—"

"Will see this as invasion. Aliens coming to destroy their ansibles, enforce survival, eliminate their choice." Zara's mind raced. "Everything Memory faction fears about Contact faction imposing survival on them—the aliens are about to do exactly that. On a species-wide scale."

She opened emergency channels to Commander Chen. To Contact faction leadership. To anyone who'd listen.

"We have a problem. Aliens arriving in three years. They're coming to shut down our ansible network whether we agree or not. Memory faction won't comply with human referendum. Aliens won't ask permission from anyone. And we have three years to prevent humanity from fighting alien rescuers who are trying to save us from Harvesters we haven't proven exist."

Chen's face appeared. The Commander looked ten years older than four months ago.

"You're certain?" Chen asked. "Aliens arriving in three years?"

"Signal analysis is clear. Doppler shift indicates relativistic approach. They're coming." Zara pulled up trajectory data. "And based on their transmission patterns, they view ansible shutdown as existential necessity. They won't negotiate. Won't accept democratic vote. They'll destroy our ansibles from orbit if they have to."

"Then we have three years to convince Memory faction to voluntarily shut down," Chen said. "Before aliens do it by force and prove every paranoid narrative about imposed survival."

"Or three years to prepare defenses," came Admiral Webb's voice—he'd patched into the channel uninvited. "Against aliens who think they have the right to destroy our civilization's communication network for our own good."

"You can't be serious," Zara said. "Fight our rescuers?"

"Fight our conquerors," Webb corrected. "You call it rescue. I call it civilizational destruction. Aliens coming to cut us off from each other permanently, overriding our democratic choice, imposing their survival protocol on humanity. How is that different from any other invasion?"

"They're trying to save us from Harvesters!"

"According to them. According to signals you've interpreted. According to threat assessment we can't independently verify." Webb's voice hardened. "For all we know, Harvesters are their myth. Their justification for destroying any civilization that uses ansible. Their way of eliminating communication technology they can't control."

"That's paranoid conspiracy theory."

"So was the ansible guild's forty-year fabrication about Earth. So was Contact faction's suppression of Earth's final message. Forgive me if I don't trust the latest narrative claiming we need to be saved by force for our own good." Webb pulled up deployment orders. "Memory faction will defend our ansibles. From Contact faction. From aliens. From anyone who thinks they have the right to isolate us because they know better than we do what survival requires."

The channel dissolved into arguing. Contact faction insisting compliance with referendum. Memory faction refusing to abide by close vote. Everyone talking past each other while alien ships accelerated toward human space.

Zara muted them all. Pulled up her private research. The data she hadn't shared yet because she wasn't certain. Wasn't ready for the implications.

But now she had no choice.

She unmuted. "Everyone shut up. I have new information."

Silence.

"I've been analyzing ansible network traffic patterns for three years. Tracking non-human signals. And I found something. Something that changes everything." She pulled up the data. "Ansible technology isn't human invention. It's alien. Ancient alien. The quantum entanglement protocols we use—they're artificial constructs. Deliberate communication infrastructure. Left behind by previous civilization."

"Impossible," someone said. "We developed ansible through quantum physics—"

"We discovered ansible," Zara corrected. "We didn't invent it. We found quantum entanglement already structured for communication. Ready to use. Waiting." She displayed the signal archaeology. "And every time a new species activates the network, it broadcasts their existence to everyone else using it. Including to the Harvesters."

"You're saying ansible is a trap?" Chen asked quietly.

"I'm saying it's a honeypot. Ancient communication infrastructure specifically designed to identify species with quantum manipulation capability. When we activated it forty years ago, we announced ourselves to the galaxy. Harvesters responded. So did the rescue species—the ones coming now. They've done this before. They detect ansible activation, race the Harvesters to reach new species first, forcibly shut down the network before Harvesters arrive."

"How many species have they rescued?" Webb asked.

"Based on historical signal patterns... at least seventeen different ansible activations in past thousand years. All of them shut down within a century of activation."

"All voluntarily?" The question hung.

"I don't know. The signals just... stop. Either species shut down voluntarily, or—"

"Or the rescuers shut them down by force," Webb finished. "This is what Memory faction has been saying. Aliens aren't offering refuge. They're enforcing survival. On their terms. Whether we consent or not."

"Because the alternative is extinction," Chen countered. "Harvesters destroy ansible civilizations. The rescue species prevent that by eliminating ansible before Harvesters arrive. They're saving us—"

"By destroying our civilization's communication network without our consent. By making us choose between connection and survival, then enforcing the survival choice whether we agree or not." Webb pulled up strategic analysis. "They're three years away. What do you think happens when they arrive and find twenty-three colonies still broadcasting ansible signals?"

"They shut them down," Zara said quietly. "By negotiation if possible. By force if necessary. They can't afford to let us keep broadcasting. It endangers their position too. Harvesters follow ansible signals. If we stay online, we lead Harvesters to the rescue species."

"So we're not being rescued. We're being quarantined." Webb's voice was bitter triumph. "Contact faction has been calling it salvation. But it's silencing. The rescue species can't let us use ansible because it threatens their survival, not just ours. Everything else—the noble mission, the refugee offer, the guidance—it's self-interested quarantine wrapped in benevolence."

"That doesn't make it wrong," Chen said. "If ansible attracts Harvesters, we have to shut down. Whether aliens are purely altruistic or protecting themselves doesn't matter. The existential threat is real."

"According to them. According to signals saying 'trust us, the threat you can't see is real.'" Webb pulled up Memory faction military readiness. "We have three years to decide: do we accept alien-imposed isolation as salvation? Or do we defend our right to communication even if they claim it will kill us?"

"This is insane," Zara said. "You're talking about fighting aliens who are trying to prevent our extinction."

"I'm talking about defending our sovereignty against aliens who assume they have the right to destroy our communication network because they claim to know better." Webb met her eyes. "You fought for three years against Contact faction imposing survival on Memory faction. Now aliens are coming to impose it on all humanity. Why is that more acceptable?"

Zara had no answer.

The referendum had failed. Humanity was still split. The aliens were coming. And instead of uniting against Harvester threat, humanity was preparing to fight its rescuers.

"Commander Chen," she said carefully. "What if we're all wrong? What if the right answer isn't Contact or Memory? What if it's... something else?"

"Explain."

"Lira Voss and Kaito Reeves are still traveling to alien coordinates. To the rescue species' home territory. They left three years ago, they're decades from arrival, but they're actually going there. To see the rescue species' civilization. To verify their claims physically." Zara pulled up relativistic calculations. "What if we delay? Three years until aliens arrive here. But during that time, we prepare Lira and Kaito to ask the real questions. To verify Harvester threat independently. To see what happened to the seventeen species that shut down their ansibles. Are they thriving? Or just... silenced?"

"You want to stall for decades," Webb said. "While Lira and Kaito gather evidence we won't receive until they return."

"I want to buy time. Keep some ansibles operational—minimal broadcast, just enough to maintain information network—while we verify the threat independently. If Lira confirms Harvesters are real, we shut down. If she finds the rescue species has other motives, we defend. But we decide based on human-gathered evidence, not alien testimony."

"The aliens won't accept that," Chen said. "They're coming to shut us down now. They won't wait decades for us to verify their claims."

"Then we negotiate," Zara said. "Three years until they arrive. We use that time to prove we're taking the threat seriously. Partial ansible reduction. Research into alternative communication. Preparation for full shutdown if evidence supports it. But also preparation for defense if evidence suggests the rescue species isn't what they claim."

"You're suggesting we prepare for both," Webb said slowly. "Cooperation and resistance simultaneously."

"I'm suggesting we stay human," Zara corrected. "Which means questioning authority, even benevolent authority. Verifying claims, even from supposed rescuers. And maintaining our right to choose, even when someone more powerful says they know better."

Silence fell across the channel.

"That's what Earth wanted," Chen said finally. "Choice. Informed choice. Based on physical evidence, not transmitted claims."

"And Lira is gathering that evidence," Zara said. "She'll reach alien territory eventually. Will verify or disprove their claims. Will send back physical proof we can trust. But only if we keep some ansibles operational long enough to receive her transmission when she returns."

"Decades from now," Webb pointed out.

"Seventy-one years until Harvesters arrive," Zara countered. "We have time. Not much. But enough to verify before committing to irreversible choice."

"And if the rescue species won't accept that delay?" Chen asked.

"Then we learn what they really are," Webb said grimly. "Benevolent saviors who respect our agency? Or authoritarian quarantine enforcers who care more about protecting themselves than respecting us?"

The three of them looked at each other across light-years. Contact military command. Memory military command. Contact research leadership. All of them exhausted by war. All of them uncertain. All of them facing the same impossible choice.

Trust the aliens and lose autonomy.

Resist the aliens and risk extinction.

Or delay and hope Lira Voss, somewhere between human space and alien territory, was gathering evidence that would make the choice clear.

"Proposal," Chen said. "Three-year preparatory period. Contact and Memory factions cease hostilities. Reduce ansible traffic to minimal sustainable levels. Prepare for both full shutdown and defensive resistance. When aliens arrive, we negotiate from position of unity: we're taking threat seriously, but we reserve right to verify their claims before irreversible action. If they're truly benevolent, they'll accept our need to verify. If not..."

"We fight," Webb finished. "Together. Humanity united against imposed salvation."

"And we wait for Lira," Zara added. "For physical evidence from someone we trust. Even if it takes decades."

It wasn't a plan anyone liked.

It was a plan everyone could accept.

Contact faction got ansible reduction and Harvester preparation.

Memory faction got to maintain communication network and human sovereignty.

Both factions got time to verify the truth before committing civilization to irreversible choice.

And Lira Voss, decades away from knowing anyone was counting on her, became humanity's long-term answer to an immediate question.

Are we being rescued?

Or silenced?

Only physical evidence would tell.

And only waiting would bring that evidence home.

The vote was 24 to 23.

The compromise was 47 to 0.

Humanity would verify before choosing.

Even if verification took decades.

Even if aliens didn't approve.

Even if it meant risking everything on one woman's ability to see the truth and survive to report it.

But that was humanity's choice.

And this time, they'd made it together.

All forty-seven colonies.

The way Earth died hoping they would.
