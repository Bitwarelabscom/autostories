# Chapter 12: Earth's Choice

Kaito Reeves woke from cryosleep for the third time in six years and immediately checked the ship's chronometer.

Six years objective. Four years subjective due to relativistic time dilation. They'd covered twelve light-years toward alien coordinates. Sixty-eight light-years remaining.

Thirty more years.

He pulled himself out of the cryopod and floated to the command deck. Lira was already there, reviewing ansible traffic they'd recorded before entering sleep. Messages from human space, Doppler-shifted and time-delayed. News from a civilization they'd left behind and wouldn't return to for decades.

"Anything interesting?" he asked.

Lira's face was grim. "The referendum happened. Humanity voted to shut down ansibles. Fifty-two percent."

"And the other forty-eight?"

"Refused to comply. Then aliens showed up in signal analysis. Not at the coordinates we're heading to—heading toward human space. Three years until arrival." She pulled up the data. "That was two years ago, ship time. By now, aliens have probably reached human space. We're flying toward coordinates that might be empty."

Kaito processed this. "Aliens coming to enforce shutdown?"

"That's the interpretation. But there's more." She displayed Zara's ansible archaeology research. "Ansible isn't human technology. It's ancient alien infrastructure. Honeypot to identify quantum-capable species."

He read the data. Felt the floor drop out from under him. Not because it was shocking—because it made perfect sense.

"I knew," he said quietly.

"What?"

"I knew ansible couldn't be human invention. We're not that advanced. I was there when Earth was developing the first ansible forty years ago. The quantum entanglement protocols just... appeared. Already structured. Already perfect. Scientists claimed they derived it from physics, but I watched them. They were reverse-engineering something they'd found, not inventing something new."

"Where did they find it?"

Kaito pulled up his own logs. The ones he'd kept private for forty years. The ones that documented Earth's final days from orbit.

"Mars," he said. "Sub-surface archaeological dig. 2838. They found quantum computing infrastructure intact beneath Olympus Mons. Ancient. Alien. Functional. Earth's ansible program went from theoretical to operational in six months after that discovery. Everyone claimed it was breakthrough in understanding. But breakthroughs don't come that fast. Not unless you're copying homework."

Lira stared at him. "You've known for forty years that ansible is alien technology?"

"I suspected. Never had proof. Earth classified the Mars dig absolutely. Only reason I knew was because I was doing relativistic cargo runs from Mars to Earth during the excavation. Saw the security perimeter. Saw the energy signatures. Saw how fast the ansible program accelerated." He met her eyes. "And I saw what happened when Earth tried to share that discovery."

"The quarantine."

"The murder." Kaito's voice went flat. "Earth made contact with the rescue species. Showed them the Mars discovery. Asked about ansible operation protocols, safety measures, communication optimization. And the rescue species responded with one demand: destroy it all. Destroy the Mars installation. Destroy all ansible infrastructure. Destroy the knowledge. Or be destroyed."

"Earth refused."

"Earth negotiated. Tried to explain that ansible was humanity's only way to maintain civilization across light-years. That without it, forty-seven colonies would fragment into forty-seven separate species. That human unity required instant communication even if physical travel was impossible." Kaito pulled up his final Earth orbit logs. "I was there. In orbit. Watching ansible traffic. Listening to Earth negotiate with aliens for three months. Earth offered everything—reduced ansible usage, scheduled blackouts, limited node network, anything to keep some level of communication operational while minimizing Harvester detection risk."

"The aliens said no."

"The aliens said: ansible or existence. Choose." He displayed the transmission logs. "And Earth chose neither. Earth chose to give colonies the choice. Called for human-wide referendum. Every colony votes on whether ansible network is worth Harvester risk."

"The vote we just had," Lira said. "Three years ago from human space perspective. Forty years too late."

"Earth never got to call that vote. The rescue species didn't wait for democracy. They arrived in force. Quarantined Earth. Cut off all communication. And presented ultimatum: Earth destroys ansible network for all colonies, or rescue species does it by force. Starting with Earth."

Lira's face was horror. "Earth died defending our right to vote?"

"Earth died buying time for the vote to happen." Kaito's hands shook as he pulled up the final transmission. The one he'd carried for forty years. The one he'd shown Zara who'd shown Commander Chen who'd released it during Chapter 1's crisis.

But there was more. Another file. Encrypted deeper. The one he hadn't shared because he wasn't ready to admit what it meant.

"Earth's final transmission had two parts," he said. "The public part—the one we released—calling for referendum, defending human choice, all of that. True and real and everything Earth wanted humanity to know."

"And the private part?"

"The confession." He unlocked the file. Earth's final message, meant only for ansible operators. For the guild. For the people who'd spent forty years fabricating Earth's messages.

Lira read it. Went pale.

*To ansible operators who receive this: If you're reading this, Earth is gone. We detonated our ansible to prevent rescue species from tracking signal to colonies. We bought you time. Maybe forty years. Maybe longer. Harvesters are real. Rescue species is real. Ansible is ancient trap. Everything they told us is true.*

*But here's what they won't tell you: The rescue species isn't trying to save you. They're trying to survive themselves. Ansible doesn't just attract Harvesters to whoever broadcasts. It attracts Harvesters to entire quantum-entangled network. All connected nodes. Which means if human colonies stay online, we don't just doom ourselves. We doom the rescue species. Their entire civilization. They're not being altruistic. They're being self-interested. And they can't afford to let us make the wrong choice.*

*We negotiated for three months. Tried to find middle path. Reduced broadcast, limited network, scheduled darkness, everything. They refused all of it. Because any ansible usage—even minimal—puts their civilization at risk. They've shut down seventeen previous ansible civilizations. All of them. Within a century of activation. Not because they love saving people. Because they can't afford to have active ansible networks in their region of space.*

*They gave us a choice: destroy ansible or be destroyed. We chose option three: buy time for you to choose. We're detonating our ansible now. Rescue species will think we complied. Will leave you alone for decades, maybe longer, thinking problem is solved. But your ansibles are still operational. You can maintain human civilization. You can stay connected. You have time to verify everything we've told you. Time to develop your own Harvester detection. Time to find real middle path we couldn't negotiate.*

*Or you can shut down. Accept rescue species' terms. Survive as isolated colonies, giving up unity for safety.*

*Either choice is legitimate. But it has to be your choice. Informed. Free. Not imposed by rescue species' existential self-interest disguised as benevolence.*

*We died so you could choose. Don't waste that sacrifice on war over competing narratives. Don't let rescue species force the choice their fears demand. And don't trust anyone who claims they know better than you what survival requires.*

*Be human. Choose. Together.*

*Earth, final transmission, 2840.287*

Silence filled the command deck.

"Earth lied to the rescue species," Lira whispered. "Detonated their ansible to fake compliance. Bought the colonies time."

"Decades of time. Long enough for humanity to verify Harvester threat independently. Long enough to develop defensive measures. Long enough to find solution Earth couldn't negotiate." Kaito pulled up navigation. "And now we're heading directly into rescue species territory. To verify everything Earth told us. To see if there really is no middle path, or if Earth just wasn't powerful enough to demand one."

"If the rescue species discovers we're still broadcasting—that Earth's sacrifice was deception—"

"They'll come to enforce shutdown by force. Which, according to our ansible traffic, they're already doing. Three years until arrival at human space when we went into cryosleep. They're probably there now. Discovering colonies maintained ansible network. Discovering Earth's forty-year deception." Kaito met her eyes. "Discovering they were lied to by species they were trying to save."

"We need to send this back. Earth's full confession. Humanity needs to know—"

"Know what? That Earth lied to the rescue species to buy us time we squandered on civil war? That rescue species' insistence on shutdown is self-interested survival, not pure altruism? That Harvester threat is real but rescue species is using it to impose their solution?" Kaito shook his head. "What changes? The fundamental choice is the same. Ansible or survival. The only new information is that rescue species has skin in the game. They're not just saving us. They're protecting themselves."

"It changes everything," Lira insisted. "Contact faction has been calling it salvation. Memory faction has been calling it tyranny. Both are right. It's imposed survival by civilization that can't afford our independence."

"So we send the message back." Kaito pulled up ansible transmission protocols. "Except we're twelve light-years out. Ansible transmission from here reaches human space instantly. But exposes our position. Tells rescue species someone is traveling from human space toward their territory. Makes us targets. We'll never reach alien coordinates. They'll intercept us."

"Then we don't transmit until we've reached the coordinates. Until we've gathered physical evidence."

"Thirty more years. During which rescue species arrives at human space, discovers ansible still operational, enforces shutdown by force or negotiation. Whatever happens back there, happens without our input. Without Earth's confession. Without humanity knowing the full context."

Lira stared at the ansible controls. The quantum entanglement system that could send messages instantly across light-years. Ancient alien infrastructure disguised as human technology. The honeypot trap that had announced humanity's existence to Harvesters and rescue species both.

"Earth chose to give humanity time," she said finally. "Lied to rescue species. Sacrificed themselves. Bought forty years for colonies to verify and choose. But the guild wasted thirty-seven of those years maintaining Earth's fabrication. We only got three years of truth before everything collapsed into war."

"And now we're twelve light-years away from human space, thirty years from reaching aliens, carrying evidence that explains everything but unable to deliver it without compromising our mission." Kaito pulled up the encrypted file. "What would you choose? Transmit now, give humanity complete information but expose ourselves and fail to gather physical verification? Or stay silent, complete the mission, hope humanity makes the right choice without knowing rescue species' full motivations?"

"Earth chose to give humanity information. Even knowing it would fracture civilization. Even knowing some would choose wrong. Because informed choice was more important than imposed survival." Lira's hands hovered over ansible controls. "We have to transmit. Have to give them Earth's confession. Even if it costs us."

"It will cost us. Rescue species monitors ansible traffic. They'll detect transmission from twelve light-years out toward their territory. They'll send intercept. We'll never reach the coordinates. Never verify. Never gather physical evidence."

"But humanity will have the full truth. Will know rescue species is self-interested. Will know Earth bought them time with deception. Will know the choice isn't between salvation and suicide—it's between accepting imposed survival from civilization that needs us isolated, or finding middle path Earth couldn't negotiate because Earth wasn't powerful enough."

"And if there is no middle path? If Harvester threat is absolute and rescue species is right that any ansible usage dooms everyone?"

"Then that's what we'll say when we transmit. We'll include everything. Earth's confession. Rescue species' motivations. Harvester threat reality. All of it. Let humanity choose with complete information instead of partial narratives from factions with agendas."

Kaito looked at this woman who'd destroyed civilization once already by choosing truth over stability. Who was about to do it again. Who couldn't seem to learn that sometimes ignorance was safer than knowledge.

Who was absolutely, terrifyingly right.

"Earth's confession goes out in five minutes," he said. "I'll encrypt it with protocols only ansible operators can decode. Guild, Contact research, Memory intelligence—they'll all get it simultaneously. Can't be suppressed by any faction. Can't be spun. Just raw data from Earth's final seconds, explaining everything."

"They'll kill us for this. Rescue species. They'll intercept us. We'll never reach alien territory."

"We were always going to die out here," Kaito said quietly. "Thirty-year mission. We're in our forties now. We'd be in our seventies when we arrived, assuming we survived the journey. Either way, this was one-way trip. At least this way, we die having given humanity the truth."

"You think that makes it worth it?"

"I think that makes it human."

The transmission compiled. Earth's full confession. The private file meant for ansible operators. The explanation that rescue species was self-interested, Harvester threat was real, Earth had lied to buy time, and humanity's choice was more complex than salvation-or-suicide.

"Transmitting in three... two... one..."

The ansible engaged. Quantum-entangled message beamed instantly across twelve light-years. Arriving at human space in zero time, readable by anyone with quantum decoding equipment.

Contact faction would receive it.

Memory faction would receive it.

Rescue species monitoring ansible traffic would receive it.

Everyone would know everything.

Including that someone was twelve light-years out, heading toward alien territory, carrying more evidence.

"How long until they intercept us?" Lira asked.

Kaito pulled up sensor data. "Already detecting course change in rescue species ships. FTL capability means they can reach us in... three weeks. Maybe four if we're lucky and they're far from us."

"Then we have three weeks to gather as much data as possible. Record everything about rescue species' response. Their intercept tactics. Their communication methods. Their technology. All of it transmitted back before they reach us."

"You think they'll kill us?"

"I think they can't afford to let us complete our mission. Can't afford physical verification of their motives. Can't afford humanity having evidence that could support Memory faction's resistance." Lira pulled up ansible transmission schedules. "We transmit everything we learn. Every day. Multiple times. Redundant copies. So even if they destroy us, humanity gets the data."

"And if rescue species is benevolent? If they're really trying to save us and we're making them enemies by believing the worst?"

"Then we're paranoid idiots who died for nothing." Lira met his eyes. "But if we're right—if rescue species is imposing survival for their own protection—then humanity needs to know that before accepting their terms."

Three weeks.

Three weeks to learn everything they could about the rescue species approaching at FTL speeds.

Three weeks to prove whether Earth was right to lie, to buy time, to give humanity the chance to verify instead of trusting.

Three weeks before the rescuers arrived.

And either saved them.

Or silenced them.

"I've been carrying Earth's confession for forty years," Kaito said quietly. "Couldn't bring myself to release it because it meant admitting Earth lied. That the sacrifice everyone mourned was also a deception. That our heroes were also manipulators."

"They were human," Lira said. "They did the best they could with impossible choices. Bought time the only way they knew how. Gave us the gift of information and agency. That's all anyone can do."

"You sound like you've made peace with what you did. Broadcasting the guild's lies. Fracturing civilization."

"I haven't. I won't. Eight million people died because I chose truth over stability." Her voice hardened. "But they died knowing why. Died making informed choices. Died free instead of dying in ignorance as someone else's puppets. If I had to choose again..."

"You'd choose truth."

"Every time."

The ansible transmitted again. Updated data. Rescue species course change. Intercept trajectory. Estimated arrival time.

Twenty-four days.

They had twenty-four days to prove the rescuers were something other than saviors.

Or die trying.

Either way, humanity would know.

Would choose with complete information.

Would be free to resist or accept.

The way Earth died hoping they'd be.

The way Lira couldn't stop making them be.

Even if it killed her.

Even if it killed everyone.

Truth first.

Always truth first.

No matter the cost.
