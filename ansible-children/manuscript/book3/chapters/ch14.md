# Chapter 14: Vigil

One year before Harvesters. All human colonies silent. Watching deep space. Tracking swarm approach. Calculating arrival times. Preparing for judgment.

Kiran transmitted final universal message: "To all human colonies. Harvesters arrive in one year. Sixty-five years since ansible died. Entire generation lived in silence. Children born knowing only isolation. This is test. This is verification. This is proof that Lira Voss was right seventy-one years ago. Maintain silence. Trust preparation. Survive together even though we are apart."

Zara Kim died three months before Harvester arrival. Age 96. Peacefully. Last ansible witness gone. With her death, ansible era became pure history. No living human remembered unity. All were born-silent or children of born-silent. Isolation was only reality they knew.

Memorial transmitted: "Dr. Zara Kim, last ansible witness, deceased age 96. Pilgrimed to Lira's grave. Honored truth-teller. Maintained memory when forgetting was easier. Linguistic fossil in her own colony. Living bridge between Before and After. Last voice of unity in age of plurality. She chose remembrance over relevance. Honor her choice. Remember what she remembered. We were unified once. We chose separation. We chose informed. She honored that choice with her life. Rest well, last witness."

Threadkeepers transmitted condolences: "Zara Kim recorded in eternal archives alongside Lira Voss. Both honored as maintainers of memory. Both choosing truth over comfort. Both bridges across impossible time. Three thousand years of preservation guaranteed. Whether humanity remembers or forgets, Threadkeepers preserve."

One year until Harvesters. All preparation complete. All quantum technology silenced. All colonies waiting.

Forty-seven colonies started. Thirty-seven still responding. Ten silent—dead or isolated completely.

Those thirty-seven watched space together. Separate but synchronized. Each colony experiencing own local now but sharing same future. Same test. Same survival or extinction.

Vigil begun. Waiting. Silent. Patient.

One year until verification that silence was worth it.

Or until proof that survival was impossible anyway.

Unknown. Uncertain. Approaching.

Humanity held breath across light-years.

Together in separation. United in isolation.

Waiting for Harvesters.

Waiting for judgment.

Waiting to learn if sixty-five years of silence had bought future or just delayed inevitable.

One year.

Maintain silence.

Survive.
