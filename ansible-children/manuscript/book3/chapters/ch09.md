# Chapter 9: Arrival

Zara returned to Kepler-442 in 2925. Age eighty. Colony had aged thirty-eight years. Mika was sixty-one. Amara was thirty-five. Language had evolved 33% from baseline.

Conversation required translator:

Amara: [Modern standard] "Welcome return, Dr. Kim. Your journey honored."

Zara: [2888 dialect] "Thank you. Lira's memorial complete. Humanity survives."

Amara: [Confused] "Memorial?"

Translator: [Clarifying] "Pilgrimage completed. Verification honored. Species continues."

Zara realized: ansible-era metaphors made no sense to generation born after. "Memorial" meant personal grief. Not civilizational honor. "Verification" meant data checking. Not philosophical truth-seeking.

She was linguistic fossil. Speaking dead language. Expressing concepts her colony no longer valued.

But they welcomed her. Honored pilgrimage. Recorded her stories. Preserved ansible-era perspective. She became living history. Teaching children about Before Time.

Worth it. She'd kept promise. Maintained memory. Connected past to future through her body, her journey, her determination.

Human. Old. Patient. Alive.

Home.

Different. Alien. Changed.

But home.
