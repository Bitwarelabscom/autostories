# Chapter 2: Departure

Zara Kim stood in the airlock of *Patient Observer*, watching Kepler-442 recede through viewports. Home. Colony where she'd spent fifty-six years. Now shrinking to pinpoint. Soon invisible.

Twenty-three years objective time until she'd see it again. Sixteen subjective. Everyone she knew would age while she traveled at 0.7c toward deep space coordinates where Lira's wreckage waited.

Mika was on the dock. Waving. Young assistant who'd barely remembered ansible. By time Zara returned, Mika would be sixty-one. Middle-aged. Grandchildren maybe. Living in culture Zara wouldn't recognize.

Time dilation was cruel gift. Allowed pilgrimage without aging to death. But cost was being perpetually out of time. Returning to future instead of home.

Zara activated final transmission: "Departing Kepler-442 for Lira Voss memorial site. Nineteen years objective until arrival. Coordinate deep space quantum navigation to wreckage coordinates. If I don't return, archives are in distributed storage. Password: verification-before-compliance. Honor Lira. Remember truth costs."

Send.

Light-speed message arriving at colonies over next forty years. By time furthest colonies received it, she'd be at Lira's grave already. Speaking to past audiences about present journey. Time and distance making communication archaeology.

*Patient Observer* accelerated. Fusion torch pushing toward 0.7c. Gravity pressing. Ship groaning. Then smoothing as velocity stabilized. Sixteen years of this. Alone except for AI navigation and frozen dreams.

Worth it. She'd promised. Promises mattered when everything else was fragmenting.

She pulled up cultural drift monitoring. Eleven months since Ch1. Kepler-442 language diverged 4.2% now. Vocabulary shifts accelerating. New metaphors emerging from isolation experience. "Light-year lonely." "Decade-delayed." "Patience generations." Phrases that made sense only to people living with isolation. Ansible generation wouldn't have needed words for experiences they'd never had.

Ross 128 was worse. 6.1% divergence. Genetic crisis driving language evolution. New medical terminology. New cultural priorities. Desperation creating vocabulary.

Proxima Centauri: 5.3%. They'd lost their quantum research facility. Threadkeeper intervention. Language reflected trauma. "Silent compliance." "Enforced salvation." Bitter phrases.

All colonies drifting. Some faster. Some slower. But all moving away from shared baseline. From each other. From mutual comprehension.

Zara wondered what Kepler-442 would sound like when she returned. How many words she wouldn't recognize. How many metaphors she'd need explained. How alien her own home would become in twenty-three years.

Time dilation didn't just separate travelers from places. It separated them from language. From culture. From meaning itself.

She'd spent fifty-six years speaking Kepler-442 standard. Dialect she knew intimately. Now she'd preserve it. Frozen in time at 2888 linguistic snapshot. While home evolved thirty-eight years forward.

Archaeological relic speaking dead language in her own colony.

But someone had to remember. Someone had to bridge past to future. Someone had to say: we were once this. Even if "this" was incomprehensible to "that."

Zara activated hibernation systems. Frozen sleep for most of journey. Reduce aging. Reduce loneliness. Reduce awareness of time passing differently for her and everyone she knew.

Final log entry before sleep: "Dr. Zara Kim, day one of pilgrimage. Purpose: honor Lira Voss who died proving we must choose informed. Promise: tell her humanity survived. Tell her verification was worth cost. Tell her we chose silence and lived. See you in sixteen years, Lira. See you in twenty-three, home. Sleep well."

Freeze.

Darkness.

Time passing at two speeds simultaneously.

Pilgrimage begun.

Memory carried across void.

Promise maintained through silence.
