# Chapter 17: Legacy

One hundred years after ansible died (2986), human colonies had fully diverged.

Cultural drift: 68% average. Mutual incomprehensibility complete. AI translation required for all inter-colony communication. Shared vocabulary below 2%.

Thirty-four colonies still responding. Three more had gone silent. Presumed dead or completely isolated.

New generation knew ansible only as ancient myth. Some colonies preserved history carefully. Others had forgotten entirely. Some debated whether Before Time was real or legendary.

But all maintained silence. Prohibition against quantum communication had become cultural law. Religious in some colonies. Traditional in others. Scientific necessity in few. But universal.

Harvesters hadn't returned. Ross 128's monitor probe remained. Watchful. Waiting. But main swarm moved on. Hunting elsewhere. Human space classified non-threat. Forgotten.

Threadkeepers monitored from distance. Twenty-one more years until complete withdrawal. Then humanity truly alone.

Kiran Osei had died thirty years ago. Age ninety-one. Last of ansible-adjacent generation. Her granddaughter continued work. Maintaining communication. Preserving memory. Bridging past to future.

Lira's grave remained. Preserved. Three pilgrimages in last hundred years. All from Kepler-442. Other colonies had forgotten or didn't care.

But memory persisted. Thin thread across generations. Someone remembered woman who'd died proving silence necessary. Someone honored verification that saved species.

Not everyone. Not most. But someone.

Sufficient.

This was humanity one hundred years after ansible. Diverged. Separate. Alive. Maintaining silence. Evolving independently.

Forty-seven experiments in humanity. Thirty-four surviving. All becoming something new.

Human-plural. Diverse. Strange. Real.
