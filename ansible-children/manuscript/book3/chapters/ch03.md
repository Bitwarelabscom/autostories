# Chapter 3: Drift

Five years after ansible shutdown, the first colony stopped responding.

Not catastrophic. Not sudden. Just... silence.

Gliese 163 had been sending regular light-speed broadcasts. Cultural updates. Scientific progress. Demographics. Standard colony reporting that maintained thin thread of connection across decades of delay.

Then nothing.

Last transmission: 2891.234. Five years ago. Should have received follow-up by now. Forty light-years meant eighty-year round-trip, but colonies transmitted annually. Pattern break meant something changed.

Mika—now twenty-eight, running Kepler-442 communications center in Zara's absence—pulled up analysis. Gliese 163's transmissions had been getting... strange. Language drifting faster than other colonies. Metaphors no one else understood. Cultural references that made no sense. Final messages almost incomprehensible even with translation assistance.

Then silence.

Options: Colony died. Colony chose isolation. Colony forgot how to communicate with others. Colony changed so much that communication seemed pointless.

No way to know. Light-speed made verification forty years away. By time rescue mission arrived, colony would be eighty years changed from when they went silent. Might not even recognize rescuers as kin.

This was new reality. Colonies could disappear and no one would know for decades. Could die and no one could help. Could transform into something alien and no one could witness.

Ansible had created illusion that human space was small. Manageable. Connected. Light-speed revealed truth: forty-seven colonies were forty-seven islands separated by decades of total isolation. If one vanished, others learned generations later.

Mika transmitted to all colonies: "Kepler-442 notes Gliese 163 silence. Last transmission 2891.234. No response expected until 2931 if colony still exists. All colonies: maintain regular broadcast schedule. Silence after 2 years triggers concern. Silence after 5 years triggers historical record. We cannot rescue. We can only remember. Transmit so we know you lived."

Grim message. But honest. This was humanity-plural. Independent. Fragile. Mortal on colony scale.

Some would survive. Some wouldn't. And survivors would learn about failures decades after prevention was possible.

Mika pulled up Zara's pilgrimage tracking. Five years into journey. Eleven more objective until she reached Lira's grave. Eleven more back. Zara was aging slowly, frozen in hibernation. Home aging quickly.

When Zara left, Kepler-442 spoke one dialect. When she returned, they'd speak another. Mika practiced the old dialect sometimes. Preparing for conversation with person from past. Learning to speak dead language so returning pilgrim could understand.

New generation growing up. Children born after ansible. To them, instant communication was fantasy. Light-speed delay was physics. Isolation was normal.

Mika's daughter—three years old—asked once: "Why did people need fast talking?"

Mika struggled to explain. "They wanted to feel close."

"But close means nearby. Other colonies are far."

"Close in... time. Not space. They wanted now to be same for everyone."

Her daughter looked confused. Of course now was local. How could distant place share your now? That violated relativity.

Younger generation didn't mourn ansible. They mourned what ansible generation mourned. Abstract loss. Inherited grief. But not personal. Not real.

Cultural transformation happening in real-time. Values shifting. Language evolving. Metaphors changing. Each generation further from ansible era. Further from unity. Further from shared human identity.

Mika wondered if Gliese 163 had experienced same thing. Generational drift so extreme that maintaining connection with other colonies felt pointless. Why speak to people forty light-years away who wouldn't understand your language, culture, or concerns?

Why indeed?

Only reason: remember you were once connected. Remember you share origin. Remember isolation is circumstance, not essence.

But memory required effort. Required caring. Required believing that connection mattered despite impossibility of proximity.

Some colonies would make effort. Some wouldn't. Humanity-plural meant variety of choices. Some isolated by choice. Some by catastrophe. Some by drift.

All valid. All human. All alive or dead independently.

Mika logged Gliese 163 as "silent - status unknown." Added to list of colonies that might be thriving, might be dead, might be transformed beyond recognition.

No way to know.

No way to help.

Just... wait. And hope. And transmit into void. And maintain thin threads of connection across impossible distance.

This was human civilization five years after ansible died.

Fragile. Scattered. Patient. Alone.
