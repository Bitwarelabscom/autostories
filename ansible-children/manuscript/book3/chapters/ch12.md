# Chapter 12: Judgment

Six years later, Harvesters reached Ross 128.

Entire human civilization watched via light-speed relays. Long-range sensors tracking Harvester approach. Three probes decelerating into Ross 128 system.

Colony population: 340,000. Evacuated to orbital stations. Deep bunkers. Anywhere that might survive if Harvesters eliminated colony infrastructure.

The probes scanned. Methodical. Thorough. Every quantum processor examined. Every computer analyzed. Every electromagnetic emission measured.

Finding: Quantum communication attempted forty-eight years ago (six years objective, but Harvesters worked from detection time). Shutdown immediately after detection. No subsequent activation.

Classification: Former quantum threat. Eliminated by inhabitants. Self-correcting civilization.

Verdict: Warning issued. Permanent monitoring established. Elimination protocol suspended.

The Harvesters deployed monitor probe. Small. Autonomous. Designed to detect any future quantum signature from Ross 128. If detected: immediate elimination. No warning. No investigation. Just destruction.

Then the three probes departed. Resumed trajectory toward main investigation zone. Arriving in seven years at original schedule.

Ross 128 survived. But changed. Permanent Harvester monitoring. One quantum signature and colony dies. Forever watched. Forever constrained.

They transmitted to all colonies: "We activated briefly. We survived. But we are monitored now. Permanently. Harvesters left sentinel. Any quantum activity means immediate death. We are on permanent probation. Learn from our mistake. Silence is not temporary. Silence is eternal. One mistake buys eternal surveillance."

Message propagated across human space. Arriving over decades. Warning carved from experience. Proof that activation risked not just death but permanent imprisonment.

Kiran updated colony status: Ross 128 - Survived with permanent Harvester monitoring. All other colonies: maintain absolute silence. No second chances.

The lesson cost 340,000 people six years of terror. Cost them permanent surveillance. Cost them freedom to ever experiment with quantum technology again.

But they lived. Constrained. Watched. Imprisoned by their own mistake.

But alive.
