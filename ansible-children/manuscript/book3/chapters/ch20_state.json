Reveal 18 human species thriving. Federation established (cooperation without unity). Honor Lira's sacrifice across deep time. Validate all costs were worth survival and diversity. Complete trilogy arc: unified → isolated → diversified → federated. Celebrate human-plural as success. Partnership with Threadkeepers as equals. Ultimate vindication: Lira was right about everything."
