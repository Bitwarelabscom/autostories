    "summary": "The five tentpole chapters maintain strong internal consistency. Ansible mechanics are solid. Light-delay math is accurate. Character knowledge tracks properly. Timeline is coherent. Planted elements properly set up. Only minor warning about travel time to aliens, and info note about AI world rule. No critical breaks. Story logic holds throughout. Themes are consistent.
