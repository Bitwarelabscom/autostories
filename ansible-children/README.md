# The Ansible's Children

A space opera trilogy where faster-than-light communication exists but FTL travel doesn't, creating a galactic civilization that's connected by data but isolated physically across decades of travel time.

## Trilogy Structure

- **Book 1: Signal Distance** - The lie that holds civilization together
- **Book 2: Propagation Delay** - When information warfare becomes actual warfare
- **Book 3: Carrier Wave** - The cost of instantaneous truth

## Setting

47 human colony systems, 2840-2880. Spread across 18-40 light-years from Earth, these colonies are connected by ansible technology (instantaneous quantum communication) but separated by decades of physical travel. The ansible guild controls all FTL communication, making them the most powerful organization in human space. But they've been hiding a terrible secret: Earth stopped transmitting 40 years ago.

## Core Themes

1. **Truth as commodity controlled by gatekeepers** - What happens when information monopolies can rewrite history?
2. **Cultural drift and the loss of common humanity** - How long can we remain united when we can never meet?
3. **Information vs. physical presence** - The fundamental difference between knowing about something and experiencing it

## Getting Started

Follow the novel generation system workflow from `/project/claude.md`:

### Phase 1: Foundation
1. Review `world/world_state.json` - world rules and setting
2. Create character files in `characters/` directory
3. Build story graph in `plot/story_graph.json`

### Phase 2-4: Follow standard workflow

## World Rules (Immutable)

- Ansible communication is instantaneous but requires massive energy (quantum entanglement)
- Physical travel maxes at 0.3c - no FTL travel possible
- Only ansible guild operators can send/receive messages (information monopoly)
- Cultural drift: ~0.8% divergence per decade from Earth baseline
- Earth went silent 40 years ago (guild has been fabricating messages)
- Ansible technology attracts Harvesters (alien Von Neumann probes)

## Technology Level

- Ansible communication (FTL messaging via quantum entanglement)
- Fusion torch ships (0.3c maximum)
- 200-year human lifespans with treatments
- Self-sufficient colony infrastructure
- No FTL travel (hard physics barrier)
- No strong AI

## Tone

Paranoid espionage thriller meets philosophical space opera. Intimate character moments play across impossible distances. Growing horror as characters realize their connection is an illusion carefully maintained by those who control information. Beauty and tragedy in watching humanity diversify into separate species.

## Unique Element

This trilogy explores the fundamental difference between communication and travel. Colonies can talk instantly but will never visit each other. They share information but not experiences. Cultural drift is making them into separate human species, and the ansible guild's manipulation is the only thing maintaining the illusion of unity. The central question: is a lie that preserves civilization better than a truth that shatters it?

## The Great Secret

Earth made first contact with aliens 40 years ago. The aliens use FTL travel and consider ansible technology dangerously detectable. When Earth tried to share ansible tech, they were quarantined. Earth sacrificed itself by detonating their ansible to prevent Harvesters from tracing the signal to the colonies. The colonial ansible network has been broadcasting for 40 years. The Harvesters are coming.
