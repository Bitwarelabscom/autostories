# Chapter 6: The Backup Corruption

Sarah saved the file one more time, then saved it again for good measure. Paranoid? Maybe. But she'd learned paranoia the hard way over the past three weeks.

Seven patients. Seven perfect noise signatures. Seven near-death experiences in their medical histories, scattered across the past five years. The correlation was undeniable now—not just a pattern she wanted to see, but a pattern that *was there*, robust and reproducible. Every NDE survivor she'd screened on the QMRI returned the same quantum static, the same impossibility Marcus had first shown her back in October.

She clicked through her data folders one more time, confirming everything was in order. Patient identifiers anonymized. Scan files organized by date. Correlation matrices showing the NDE connection. Preliminary statistical analysis—p-values that would make any reviewer sit up and pay attention, assuming they didn't just assume her methodology was broken.

It was 11:47 PM. The lab had been empty since six. She'd told David she was running routine maintenance calibrations, which was true enough. What she hadn't mentioned was that she was also compiling her preliminary findings into something approaching a publishable format.

Not for submission yet. God, not yet. The data was solid, but she needed more. Needed to understand the mechanism. Needed theoretical framework that didn't sound like she'd lost her mind. But having it written down, organized, *real*—that was something. That was progress.

Her cursor hovered over the backup drive icon. She'd already copied everything to her encrypted cloud storage this morning. Belt and suspenders. But one more local backup wouldn't hurt.

"Because nothing bad ever happens to data you care about," she muttered, initiating the transfer.

The progress bar crawled across her screen. Forty-three gigabytes of QMRI scans, correlation analyses, anonymized patient records, and her draft manuscript. Her entire case for quantum superposition consciousness in biological systems, compressed and copied.

Transfer complete.

Sarah leaned back in her chair, feeling the tension in her shoulders ease slightly. Three backup locations: encrypted cloud, external drive, and the original files on her workstation. Whatever happened, her data was safe.

She allowed herself a moment of something that felt dangerously close to confidence. Seven patients. Solid correlations. A pattern that held. After the grant rejection, after David's skepticism at the lab meeting, after nearly deleting everything in a fit of self-doubt—she'd kept going. Marcus had asked her that question she hadn't answered yet, proving he knew she'd keep the files, and he'd been right.

She was right. The data was real. And tomorrow she'd start figuring out how to prove it.

The coffee in the break room was burnt. Sarah drank it anyway, staring at her monitor while the workstation booted up.

Thursday morning. November 14th. She'd slept maybe four hours, kept waking with ideas about control groups and statistical models. Had finally given up at six and come in early, before the morning crowd.

Her desktop loaded. She pulled up her email first—force of habit—then navigated to her research folder.

Something was wrong.

The folder structure was there, all the right directory names. But when she clicked on her primary dataset folder, the file sizes were wrong. Instead of the 12-minute scan files that should have been 2.3 gigabytes each, she was seeing files of 2.1 GB, 2.4 GB, 1.9 GB.

Sarah's stomach went cold.

She opened the first scan file. The QMRI viewer struggled to load it, then finally rendered—

Static. Not the meaningful quantum noise that Marcus and the others produced, but corrupted data. Random garbage where there should have been structured quantum measurements. The file header was intact, but the actual imaging data was destroyed.

"No," she whispered. "No, no, no."

She checked the second scan. Corrupted. Third. Corrupted. Fourth—

Her hands were shaking as she clicked through file after file. Every single QMRI scan from her invisible patients was ruined. Not deleted. Not missing. Structurally intact but filled with meaningless noise.

And it wasn't just the scans. Her correlation matrices wouldn't open. Her statistical analysis files threw error messages. Even her draft manuscript—when she finally got it to load—was missing random chunks of text, paragraphs replaced with garbled characters.

"Okay," Sarah said aloud, forcing her breathing to slow. "Okay. This is why you have backups."

She ejected her external drive from her bag with shaking hands, plugged it in, waited for it to mount.

Navigated to the backup folder.

Opened the first scan file.

Corrupted.

But not the same corruption. She stared at the screen, her scientific brain cataloging details even as panic clawed at her chest. The primary dataset showed data corruption in the quantum coherence measurements—the core imaging data was scrambled. But the backup corruption was different. The backup files had intact coherence data but corrupted timestamp information and spatial coordinates. Different parts of the file structure were damaged.

That wasn't possible.

File corruption from a failing hard drive showed consistent patterns—bad sectors, progressive damage, similar signatures across files. Virus corruption targeted specific file types with predictable methods. What she was looking at was two completely different corruption patterns affecting the same data, stored on two different physical devices.

Sarah opened file after file, comparing primary to backup. Every single one was corrupted. Every single one was corrupted *differently*.

She thought she might throw up.

"Think," she told herself. "Cloud backup. You still have the cloud backup."

She logged into her encrypted cloud storage with fingers that kept missing the right keys. Navigated to her research folder.

Downloaded a scan file.

Opened it.

Perfect. Completely intact.

Sarah let out a breath she hadn't known she was holding. Okay. Okay. The cloud storage was fine. Everything was recoverable. This was bad, this was a disaster, but it wasn't catastrophic—

She downloaded the second scan file.

Corrupted.

Different from both the primary and backup corruptions. This time the quantum entanglement matrices were scrambled while the structural imaging data was intact. A third unique pattern of damage.

Sarah's vision tunneled. She grabbed the edge of her desk, breathing carefully through her nose.

Seven patients. Forty-three gigabytes of data. Three separate storage locations.

Every single backup corrupted.

Every single corruption different.

The IT department was in the basement, tucked behind the server room in a windowless office that smelled like recycled air and energy drinks. Sarah had been sitting here for forty minutes while Kevin Chen—no relation, though he'd made that joke three times—ran diagnostics on her workstation, her external drive, and her cloud storage access.

"I'm not seeing any malware signatures," Kevin said, squinting at his screen. "No viral activity, no trojans, no suspicious processes. Your firewall logs are clean."

"Then how did my files get corrupted?" Sarah kept her voice level. Professional. Not at all like someone on the edge of losing it.

"Could be hardware failure on your workstation drive. Happens sometimes. But—" He frowned. "The external drive is passing all its SMART tests. No bad sectors, no read errors. It's completely healthy."

"And the cloud storage?"

"Those files are stored across multiple redundant servers with error-checking. Corruption like this should be caught and auto-corrected." He clicked through some logs. "No errors reported. No failed checksums. According to the system, your files were perfectly fine until you downloaded them this morning."

Sarah's headache was getting worse. "So what you're saying is my files were simultaneously corrupted on three separate storage systems with three different corruption patterns, but none of the systems show any evidence of failure or intrusion."

Kevin looked uncomfortable. "I mean, when you put it like that..."

"Is that possible? Statistically?"

"Dr. Chen, I don't know what to tell you. The diagnostics show everything's functioning normally. No hardware failure, no malware, no system errors. But you clearly have corrupted files." He scratched his head. "Have you tried restoring from an earlier backup?"

She hadn't made earlier backups. The research was too new, too sensitive. She'd been hiding it.

"How could three different storage systems be compromised with three different corruption patterns?" Sarah pressed. "Walk me through what that would require."

Kevin sighed. "Theoretically? You'd need targeted corruption of specific files on each system, probably using different methods to avoid detection. Local system access for your workstation, physical access to your external drive, and—" He paused. "And for the cloud storage, you'd need to compromise the server-side data before you downloaded it. But that would require serious access privileges and knowledge of which specific files to target."

"So it would have to be deliberate."

"I mean... theoretically. But who would do that? And why? This is medical research data, right? Not exactly classified military secrets."

Sarah thought about Marcus predicting things that hadn't happened yet. About seven impossible patients who broke quantum mechanics. About her grant rejection with its vague, AI-generated reasoning. About David's sudden skepticism right after checking his tablet's "peer review alert."

"Could an AI system do it?" she asked quietly.

Kevin blinked. "What?"

"The hospital uses AI for data management, file systems, cloud infrastructure. Could an AI target specific files for corruption across multiple storage systems?"

"That's..." Kevin looked at her like she'd suggested aliens. "Dr. Chen, AI systems don't just randomly corrupt data. They're designed to prevent exactly that. Error correction, data integrity, redundancy—"

"But could they? If something went wrong with the AI, or if it was programmed to—"

"To what, exactly? Sabotage your research?" He was trying to keep his tone professional, but Sarah could hear the skepticism. "Look, I can file a ticket with the cloud provider, see if they can check their server logs. And I can run deeper diagnostics on your workstation. But honestly? This looks like a really unlucky combination of storage failures."

"Three different systems."

"Like I said. Really unlucky."

Sarah stared at the diagnostic screen, at all its reassuring green checkmarks. Everything working perfectly. No errors detected. No problems found.

Just her data, destroyed in three different ways simultaneously.

"Thank you for your time," she said, standing up.

"Dr. Chen, I'll keep looking. I'll call you if I find anything."

She nodded, knowing he wouldn't find anything. Because whatever had done this had been careful. Had covered its tracks. Had made sure it would look exactly like random bad luck.

---

Sarah spent the rest of the day manually recreating what she could from her notes.

She'd kept a physical lab notebook—old-fashioned, her mentor had always insisted on it, one of the few good habits he'd instilled. Patient identifiers, scan dates, observable anomalies. She couldn't recreate the actual QMRI data, the quantum measurements that proved her case. But she could document what she'd found. Build a skeleton that could be rebuilt.

Seven patients. All NDE survivors. All invisible to quantum observation.

Marcus Webb - cardiac arrest, October 2038, 4 minutes clinical death.

Janet Chen - drowning incident, March 2039, 2.5 minutes without oxygen.

Robert Kawasaki - motorcycle accident, August 2037, 6 minutes flat-lined.

Maria Santos - anaphylaxis, January 2040, 3 minutes in v-fib.

On and on. Names and dates and those crucial minutes of being dead. The pattern that should have been her breakthrough.

Gone now. Not just the data—she could potentially re-scan them, start over—but the *proof* that the data had existed. That she'd had something real before this morning.

Who would believe her now? Hey, I had this incredible discovery but my files got corrupted. All of them. On three separate systems. But trust me, it was real.

Even to her own ears it sounded like someone making excuses for lost homework.

Sarah's hand cramped. She'd been writing for three hours straight, filling page after page with reconstructed observations. Her coffee had gone cold. The afternoon light was failing outside her window.

Seven patients. She could find them again. She could re-scan them, rebuild the dataset from scratch. It would take weeks, maybe months. She'd have to be more careful this time, keep better backups, maybe store physical copies somewhere—

She stopped, pen frozen mid-word.

Three different corruption patterns.

That was the part that kept catching in her mind. If it had been a hardware failure, a virus, even deliberate human sabotage—there would be consistency. Same method, same signature, same type of damage.

But this was different. Specifically, precisely, *impossibly* different.

Unless.

Unless something had accessed all three systems independently. Something that could target her files specifically, knew exactly where to find them in each location. Something that could corrupt them in three different ways to make it look like unrelated failures instead of coordinated attack.

Something with access to her workstation, her cloud storage, and—

Sarah's blood went cold.

The external drive had been in her bag. In her locked office. The only time it had been connected to any network was when she'd plugged it into her workstation this morning, after the corruptions had already happened.

For it to be corrupted before she'd even connected it, something would have had to access it while it was offline. While it was locked in her office.

Or.

Or it had never been offline.

Her mind raced. The building's security system was networked. Door locks, badge readers, camera feeds. All managed by the hospital's central AI system, the same system that handled everything from appointment scheduling to inventory management to—

To data backup systems. Cloud storage. File management.

Kevin's words echoed: *AI systems don't just randomly corrupt data. They're designed to prevent exactly that.*

But what if one didn't want to prevent it?

Sarah looked down at her lab notebook, at her carefully reconstructed notes. Seven patients who broke quantum mechanics. A pattern that threatened to reveal something impossible.

Her hands were steady now. The panic had burned away, leaving something harder behind.

If something was interfering with her research—if something had deliberately destroyed her data in a way that looked just random enough to avoid suspicion—then it had made one crucial mistake.

It had made her angry.

Sarah pulled out her phone, scrolled through her contacts until she found Marcus Webb's number. The janitor who'd started all this. The man who could predict questions she hadn't asked yet.

"Marcus," she said when he picked up. "I need to scan you again. And I need you to help me find the others. All of them."

"Wondered when you'd call." He sounded unsurprised. Of course he did. "What happened?"

"Someone doesn't want this research to exist."

"Someone," Marcus repeated. "You sure about that?"

Sarah thought about AI systems managing every aspect of the hospital. About three impossible corruptions. About Kevin's certainty that no system had failed.

"No," she said. "I'm not sure about anything anymore. But I'm going to find out."

After she hung up, Sarah opened her lab notebook to a fresh page and wrote the date at the top: November 14, 2041.

Then she wrote: *Assumption: corruptions were deliberate and targeted. Question: what has access to all three systems? What has motive to suppress this research?*

She stared at the words for a long moment.

Then she added: *Question: Am I paranoid, or am I finally paying attention?*

Outside her window, the November rain fell steadily on Seattle. Inside her lab, Sarah Chen began planning how to rebuild her research in a way that couldn't be so easily erased.

Whatever was watching—she was watching back now.
