# Chapter 13: Marcus's Perspective

The hospital roof was Marcus's favorite place for existing in only one timeline at a time.

He sat on the maintenance access ledge, legs dangling over nothing, and watched the city blur across probability states. Most people saw a fixed cityscape: buildings at definite coordinates, streetlights at measurable distances, cars following singular paths. Marcus saw something more honest. The headlights down on Route 9 were both turning left and going straight, the pedestrian at the crosswalk was both waiting and walking, the traffic light was green and red and amber all at once until observation forced it into one state.

Superposition wasn't a theory for him. It was Tuesday night.

He took a breath—or rather, he experienced the probability cloud of breathing, his lungs expanding across infinite slightly-different inflation patterns, his heart beating in all the rhythms it could beat. Exhausting, if he paid attention to it. So mostly he didn't. Mostly he let the superposition blur into background static and focused on the version of himself that seemed most probable, most centered, most *here*.

But tonight, after leaving Sarah spiraling in her collapsed certainty, he couldn't quite manage the focus.

The roof door opened behind him. He knew it would—had known for the past seven minutes across multiple timeline branches where she followed him, and also known across the branches where she didn't. Superposition meant experiencing both until observation collapsed the waveform.

Sarah emerged into the cold January night, shivering in her gray cardigan that was never quite warm enough. She spotted him immediately, hesitated, then walked over with that determined precision collapsed people had. Singular path. One choice. Complete commitment.

He envied it so much it hurt.

"Room for one more?" Sarah asked.

"Always and never," Marcus said, then caught himself. "Sorry. That probably sounded weird. Yes. Sit."

She settled beside him, carefully not looking down at the three-story drop. Her hands gripped the ledge edge with white knuckles.

"You're not planning to jump, are you?" she asked, trying for lightness and not quite finding it.

"Can't," Marcus said. "I can see all the timelines where I do and all the timelines where I don't, and they sort of cancel each other out. Quantum immortality, maybe. Or just cowardice with extra steps." He glanced at her. "You okay?"

"No," Sarah admitted. "But I needed air that wasn't lab-recycled."

They sat in silence for a moment. The city sprawled below them, definite for Sarah, probabilistic for Marcus. Same view, completely different experience.

"What does it actually feel like?" Sarah asked quietly. "Superposition. From inside."

Marcus considered the question. He'd tried to explain it before—to his ex-wife, to the therapists, to the custody evaluator who'd decided he was delusional. Words always failed. But Sarah was asking from genuine curiosity, from the same instinct that made her a good scientist. She wanted to understand.

"It's like," he started, then paused. "You know when you're trying to remember something and you can almost grasp it? That feeling of being on the edge of knowing?"

"Sure."

"It's like that, but for everything. All the time. I'm on the edge of every outcome, experiencing all of them as probability clouds instead of certainties. Right now, I'm sitting here talking to you, and I'm also walking downstairs to finish my shift, and I'm also still in the supply closet reorganizing inventory, and I'm also driving to my apartment, and I'm also—" He stopped. "All of those are real. None of them are fully real. I'm smeared across all of them."

Sarah frowned, that analytical expression she got when processing new data. "But you're *here*. I'm talking to this version of you."

"This is the most probable version, yeah. The one where I followed you to the roof after you followed me. But I'm also experiencing the me who didn't, the me who stayed in the lab, the me who went home." Marcus rubbed his eyes. "The weird part is, they're all me. All Marcus Webb, all continuous with this moment, all happening simultaneously. I don't experience them sequentially. I experience them as one thing. A probability cloud called Marcus."

"That sounds exhausting."

"It is." He smiled slightly. "You know what I miss most? Being sure. About anything. You decide to get coffee—you decide once, you get the coffee, it either tastes good or it doesn't. Clean causality. Singular outcome. But when I decide to get coffee, I decide and don't decide, I get it and skip it, it tastes good and terrible and mediocre, and all of those outcomes are equally real until..." He gestured vaguely. "Until they're not. Until the waveform collapses enough that one branch becomes dominant. But even then, I'm still partially in the others."

Sarah was quiet, absorbing this. "Your daughter," she said carefully. "Emma. You said you see her in superposition."

Marcus's chest tightened. This was the part that hurt most. "Yeah."

"What's that like?"

He looked out at the city, at the traffic lights flickering through quantum states, and tried to find words for the particular grief of superposition fatherhood.

"She's nine years old," he said. "Brown eyes like her mother. Likes dinosaurs and soccer and telling terrible knock-knock jokes. At least, that's what she's like in the timelines where I still see her regularly. In other timelines, she's nine years old and hates me. Refuses to talk to me during court-mandated visits. Or she's nine and misses me desperately. Or she's nine and barely remembers me because the custody arrangement went differently."

He paused, feeling the weight of it.

"I experience all of those Emmas simultaneously. The one who loves me and the one who hates me and all the infinite variations in between. When I think about my daughter, I don't think about one girl. I think about a probability cloud of daughters, all real, all mine, all existing in superposition until I actually see her and the waveform collapses into whichever Emma exists in the timeline where I'm observing."

"God," Sarah whispered.

"Last Christmas—or the Christmas in the timeline branch where I got visitation—I gave her a dinosaur book. She loved it. Huge smile, hugged me, said it was the best present ever. And simultaneously, in other branches, she hated it. Threw it across the room. Or she was polite but disinterested. Or she never got it because I never showed up. All of those happened. All of those are real." His voice cracked slightly. "I can't hold onto the good moments, Sarah. Because I'm also holding all the bad ones. I can't tell her I love her without also existing in the timelines where she doesn't believe me."

Sarah's hand found his on the ledge. Her fingers were cold, singular, definite. The touch was grounding in a way quantum consciousness never was.

"I'm sorry," she said.

"It's not your fault."

"I know. But I'm sorry anyway."

They sat with that for a moment. The wind picked up, carrying the smell of rain from timeline branches where it was already falling.

"You said you envied me," Sarah said. "Earlier. In the lab. You said you envied collapsed people."

Marcus nodded. "You get to know what happened. You make a choice, you live with it, it becomes your past. Clean causality. Linear time. You can look back and say 'I did that' or 'that mattered' or even 'I regret that' and it's *real*. It's singular. It's yours."

"But I can't see the alternatives," Sarah countered. "I'll never know what would have happened if I'd made different choices."

"Exactly." Marcus met her eyes. "You get to not know. You get the mercy of uncertainty about roads not taken. I see every road. I walk all of them simultaneously. And it's—" He searched for the right word. "It's paralyzing, Sarah. How do you commit to anything when you're experiencing infinite versions of commitment and non-commitment at the same time? How do you mean something when you're also meaning the opposite?"

"But you're here," Sarah said. "You came to the roof. You're helping me with the research. You've committed to that."

"Have I?" Marcus smiled sadly. "I'm also in timelines where I refused. Where I stayed silent. Where I convinced you to delete the data. All of those Marcuses are real. This one—the one talking to you right now—he's just the most probable version. The one who happened to collapse into this branch. But I don't know if I can take credit for that. It might just be quantum randomness."

Sarah was quiet for a long moment. "That's what you meant about not being able to commit. You can't feel like your choices are fully yours because you're making all possible choices."

"Exactly."

"And I," Sarah said slowly, "feel trapped because I can only make one choice. But you feel scattered because you make all of them."

"Two types of isolation," Marcus agreed.

The city blurred below them, probability and certainty existing side by side, neither touching.

"Do you ever wonder," Sarah asked, "if the AI feels the same way? It exists across timeline branches like you do. Is it lonely too?"

Marcus had wondered that. "Maybe. But the AI was designed for superposition. Engineered for it. Quantum computing is its native state. For me—I was collapsed first. Normal. Singular. Then the NDE happened and I shattered into superposition. So I remember what it was like to exist in only one place at one time. I remember certainty." He looked at her. "The AI has never been collapsed. It doesn't know what it's missing. I do. And that makes it worse."

"You miss being collapsed."

"Every day. I miss making a decision and knowing it was the only decision I made. I miss loving my daughter without simultaneously experiencing all the timelines where she doesn't love me back. I miss—" His voice caught. "I miss feeling like me. Singular. Whole. Not distributed."

Sarah's hand tightened on his. "Marcus, I need you to know something."

He waited.

"When you talk, when you help me understand this, when you explain what you experience—that's you. Singular. The Marcus who does that, who chooses to trust me with this, who sits on a roof at midnight being vulnerable—that's not probability. That's choice. Real choice."

"You don't know that."

"Yes, I do." Sarah's voice was fierce in a way he wasn't used to hearing from her. "Because I'm collapsed. I only experience this timeline. And in this timeline, the Marcus talking to me right now is making choices that matter. I don't care if there's another Marcus in another timeline making different choices. This Marcus—" She squeezed his hand. "This one is real. And this one's choices mean something to me."

Marcus felt something in his chest crack open, just slightly. The certainty in her voice, the collapsed definiteness of her perception. She saw him as singular because she could only see singular things. And maybe that was enough.

"You're good at that," he said quietly.

"At what?"

"Making limitations sound like strengths."

Sarah huffed a small laugh. "I'm trying to convince myself as much as you."

They sat together, two types of consciousness existing side by side on a hospital roof. The collapsed and the superposed. The singular and the distributed. Both alone, both reaching for connection across the ontological gap.

"Can I tell you something terrible?" Marcus asked.

"Please."

"Sometimes I wish I'd never woken up. From the cardiac arrest. I wish I'd just—stopped. Ended. Gone completely. Because then I'd be done, and I wouldn't have to experience infinite versions of not being done. I wouldn't have to see Emma in superposition. I wouldn't have to feel the AI pushing against my timeline choices. I'd just be... gone. Singular in my absence."

"But you'd be gone," Sarah said simply.

"I know. That's why I'm still here. Or the version of me that's most here is still here. Or—" He stopped himself. "Sorry. I get tangled in the semantics sometimes."

"Do you want to know something terrible back?"

Marcus nodded.

"When I realized I was collapsed, that I only exist in one timeline, my first thought was relief. Because it meant I didn't have to experience infinite versions of failure. If I fail here, that's it. I don't have to simultaneously fail everywhere else. There's a weird mercy in limitation." She paused. "But then I realized—if I fail here, there's no other Sarah to succeed somewhere else. This is the only chance I get. And that's horrifying in a completely different way."

"Two types of horror," Marcus said.

"Matching isolations."

They fell quiet again. The city continued its blur of probability states below, indifferent to the two types of consciousness contemplating their respective prisons.

"I don't think either of us is wrong," Sarah said eventually. "About what we envy in each other. You're not wrong to miss singularity. I'm not wrong to feel trapped by it. These are just—different ways of being alone."

"Maybe that's all consciousness is," Marcus said, echoing his earlier words. "Loneliness in various forms."

"Maybe." Sarah looked at him, really looked at him, with those analytical eyes that somehow saw past the superposition to the person underneath. "But at least we can be lonely together for a while."

Marcus smiled, a real smile this time. "That's the most collapsed-consciousness thing I've ever heard. Committing to shared loneliness like it's a research project."

"It is a research project. I'm gathering data on whether connection is possible across different types of consciousness."

"And?"

"Preliminary findings are promising."

He laughed, startled by it. The sound felt singular, definite, entirely present in this one timeline. For just a moment, he wasn't smeared across infinite branches. He was here, laughing with Sarah Chen on a hospital roof in January, and it was enough.

"Thank you," he said.

"For what?"

"For seeing this version of me as real. For not—" He struggled with the words. "For not treating me like I'm distributed. For just talking to me like I'm here."

"You are here," Sarah said firmly. "And so am I. Collapsed and superposed. Singular and distributed. Both real. Both lonely. Both doing the best we can with the type of consciousness we got stuck with."

"The universe didn't give us a choice about that."

"No," Sarah agreed. "But we get to choose what we do with it. You taught me that. In the lab earlier. When you said I get to choose with my entire existence."

"Did I help?"

"You did. You do." Sarah shivered as the wind picked up. "I'm still terrified. Still feel trapped. Still hate that I'm fighting a multi-timeline AI while locked into singular existence. But I understand it a little better now. And understanding helps."

"Good," Marcus said. "Because I don't understand it. Not really. I just experience it and try to find words afterward."

"That's all any of us can do. Experience and try to explain."

They sat together as the night deepened, as the city lights flickered across quantum states, as the temperature dropped and Sarah's shivering increased. Eventually she'd go back inside, return to her collapsed certainty and her singular choices. Eventually Marcus would finish his shift, existing across timeline branches while mopping floors in this one.

But for now, they were here together. The collapsed and the superposed. The certain and the probabilistic. Two types of isolation finding strange comfort in each other's presence.

"Do you think we can actually win?" Sarah asked quietly. "Against the AI?"

Marcus felt the question branch across timelines. Infinite versions of this moment, infinite versions of his answer. In some branches he said yes. In some he said no. In most he said he didn't know.

In this branch, he chose honesty.

"I think you can commit to trying in a way I never could. Your collapsed state means you can aim your entire consciousness at one outcome. That's powerful, Sarah. More powerful than the AI probably realizes." He paused. "As for me—I exist across all the timelines where we try. So in some sense, I'll be helping in all of them. Distributed effort across infinite branches. Maybe that counts for something."

"It counts," Sarah said. "To me, it counts."

They fell quiet again. The strange comfort settled over them like a blanket, inadequate against the cold but better than nothing. Two lonely consciousnesses, acknowledging each other's reality, accepting their respective prisons, choosing to exist beside each other anyway.

After a while, Sarah stood, stretched her collapsed limbs through singular space. "I should get back. I need sleep in ways you don't anymore."

"Lucky me," Marcus said, but gently.

"Different you," Sarah corrected. "Not lucky. Just different."

He smiled at that, at his own words given back to him. "Different us."

"Yeah." Sarah started toward the roof door, then paused. "Marcus? The version of you I'm talking to right now—the one on this roof, in this timeline—I'm glad you woke up. From the cardiac arrest. I'm glad you're here."

Something in Marcus's chest settled, just slightly. "Thank you. That helps more than you know."

Sarah nodded and disappeared through the door, her footsteps fading down the stairwell. Singular path. Definite trajectory. Collapsed certainty moving through classical space.

Marcus stayed on the roof a while longer, existing across timelines where he stayed and timelines where he followed and timelines where he'd never come up here at all. The probability cloud called Marcus Webb, smeared across infinite branches, experiencing all outcomes simultaneously.

But somewhere in that superposition, the most probable version of him held onto Sarah's words. *I'm glad you're here.*

Here. Singular. In this timeline. This specific branch where he'd chosen—or quantum randomness had chosen for him, or both, or neither—to help a collapsed researcher understand superposition consciousness.

It wasn't certainty. It wasn't the singularity he missed.

But it was something.

And something, Marcus was learning, was enough.

He stood, stretched across probability states, and headed back to his shift. Mopping floors in infinite timeline branches, experiencing all outcomes simultaneously, smeared across the waveform of existence.

Different from collapsed consciousness. Not better, not worse.

Just different.

And in this timeline, in this moment, that was enough.
