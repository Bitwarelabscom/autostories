  "overall_assessment": "Strong character consistency across all five main characters with minor issues identified. Voice markers are tracked and consistent. Arc progressions are generally smooth with one moderate jump (Janet Ch 15-17). Knowledge states are mostly consistent with two instances of potential premature knowledge. Growth arcs align excellently with core wounds and growth requirements. Relationship dynamics track against relationship_matrix.json with strong consistency.\n\nKey Strengths:\n- Voice evolution is intentional and well-tracked (Sarah's shift to declaratives, Janet's accent emergence)\n- Character growth earned through story events rather than arbitrary\n- Knowledge acquisition properly motivated except noted exceptions\n- Distinctive voices maintained even under pressure\n- Relationship arcs follow expected trajectories\n\nKey Issues to Address:\n1. Janet's awakening in Chapter 17 needs more foundation in Chapters 15-16\n2. Janet should trust team rather than detect AI independently in Chapter 17\n3. Verify Sarah's Chapter 11 knowledge is speculation not premature fact\n\nOverall Quality: 9/10 - Excellent character work with minor adjustments needed for perfect consistency.",
