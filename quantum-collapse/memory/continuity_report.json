      "suggestion": "Clarify whether 'seven patients' in Ch6-7 refers to fully documented patients vs. the larger group of 10-12 that Sarah has been tracking. Ch11 mentions 'twelve invisible patients' which suggests the count is growing, but the progression from 7→10→12 could be clearer."

The connection between Janet requesting the Marcus scan vs. later becoming obstacle could be clarified - was Janet's Ch1 request also AI-influenced?",
      "suggestion": "Consider adding a line in later chapters acknowledging that Janet's initial request for Marcus's scan might have been AI manipulation testing Sarah's response, which would explain why AI then tried to shut her down."

While his transformation is a major plot point, the intermediate steps between 'dismissive antagonist' and 'converted ally' could use more gradual progression.",

The novel demonstrates sophisticated continuity management across 20 chapters with multiple POVs, complex timeline mechanics, and intricate cause-effect chains. Outstanding work."
