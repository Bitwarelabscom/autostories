# Chapter 8: Yuki's Decision

The third transfer landed at 00:01 on the first of the month, like clockwork. Like something Yuki could maybe, possibly, they didn't want to jinx it but—like something real.

They were awake when it happened. Of course they were awake. Yuki was always awake at 00:01 because the overnight shift at ProspectCafe started at 00:30 and the transit took twenty-two minutes if they ran and twenty-eight if they walked and they always built in a buffer, always, because being late meant demerit points and demerit points meant prosperity score drops and prosperity score drops meant—

The notification chimed. 2,000 SC deposited. Anonymous transfer.

Three months in a row.

Yuki sat on the edge of their sleeping pod—not even a bed, just a pod, coffin-sized, in a building full of pods stacked six high—and stared at their account balance. 4,847 credits. They'd spent conservatively, terrified the money would stop. Bought actual food instead of nutri-paste. Paid rent three months forward just in case. Fixed their shoes.

But the money kept coming.

Chen had quit his overnight cargo job. Marcus had bought his daughter shoes and was talking about—god, about maybe cutting back his hours. Sarah Kim had stopped taking Leveler entirely.

And Yuki worked three jobs that paid, combined, less than 2,000 credits a month.

The math was simple. The math had always been simple. Work sixty-eight hours a week to make 1,800 credits, or don't work and make 2,000.

The math had never been the problem.

Yuki's hands shook as they pulled up their work schedules. Three apps, three different corporate interfaces, three different "motivational messages" that played before you could access anything.

*ProspectCafe: "Your Smile Is Our Success!"*

*CleanSweep Maintenance: "Building Tomorrow's Prosperity, One Clean Surface at a Time!"*

*DataSort Inc: "Your Productivity Lifts All Ships!"*

They'd had these jobs for two years. Four years. Three years. In that order. They couldn't remember anymore which one they'd gotten first or why or if they'd ever chosen any of this or if it had just... happened. The way poverty happened. The way their prosperity score had dropped after they got sick and missed work and then dropped more when they couldn't afford the medical visit and then dropped more when they couldn't afford the medication and then suddenly they were in Sector 12 in a sleeping pod and that was just life now.

00:09. Twenty-one minutes until shift start.

Yuki opened ProspectCafe's app first. The resignation option was buried in settings under "Career Development Opportunities" under "Alternative Pathways" under "Workforce Optimization Options." Because even quitting had to sound like success.

Their finger hovered over "Request Voluntary Workforce Reallocation."

The cafe job was fine. Actually fine. Yuki liked making coffee. Liked the ritual of it, the precision. Liked that regular customer Mr. Okafor who always said thank you, actually looked at them like a person. The problem was the overnight shift. The problem was twenty-eight hours a week from 00:30 to 06:30 six nights a week on top of everything else. The problem was they'd worked overnights for so long they couldn't remember what morning looked like.

But if they quit this one and quit DataSort too—the mindless work of sorting corporate data streams for algorithm training, the job that made their eyes bleed and their back seize up—if they quit those two and just kept CleanSweep, the maintenance job they did 10:00 to 16:00 five days a week...

They could sleep.

The thought was so alien it felt dangerous.

Yuki's breath came too fast. Anxiety spiking. They recognized the feeling—they'd lived with generalized anxiety disorder since they were sixteen, untreated because treatment cost money and taking time off for appointments cost money and medication cost money and everything, always, cost more than they had.

"It's just work," they said aloud to the empty pod space. Their voice sounded wrong in the dark, too loud. "Sorry. Sorry, I'm just—I'm just thinking about quitting work, which is insane, right? That's insane. The money could stop any day and then I'd have no jobs and no income and—"

But it hadn't stopped. Three months. Three perfect, impossible months.

And they were so fucking tired.

00:13.

Yuki pulled up DataSort Inc first. That one was easy. They hated it. Hated the sterile white interface and the cheerful notifications about "productivity milestones" and the way the algorithm knew when you were getting distracted and played little motivational chimes that made you want to shove your tablet through a wall.

They navigated the resignation menus. Read the warning: *"Voluntary workforce reallocation may impact your prosperity score. Are you certain you want to proceed with this growth opportunity?"*

Growth opportunity. Corporate-speak for abandonment. For admitting you weren't productive enough. For failure.

"Sorry," Yuki whispered to no one. To the corporation. To themselves. "Sorry, I just—I need to not do this anymore. Is that okay? I'm sorry."

They hit confirm before they could stop themselves.

*Your voluntary workforce reallocation will be processed within 48 business hours. Thank you for your service to DataSort Inc. We wish you prosperity in your future endeavors!*

Their heart hammered. Okay. Okay. That was one. That was sixteen hours a week gone. Sixteen hours they could use to sleep or eat or just exist without a timer running.

00:17.

ProspectCafe next. The overnight shift. Yuki opened the app again, navigated back to the resignation menus, stopped.

This one felt different. They actually liked making coffee. What if they could just... switch shifts? Work mornings instead? See sunlight? Talk to customers when they weren't half-dead from exhaustion?

The app had a "Schedule Modification Request" option. Yuki filled it out with shaking fingers, checking their anxiety symptoms like a pilot running through a pre-flight list: Elevated heart rate. Check. Shallow breathing. Check. Intrusive thoughts about everything going wrong. Check and check and check.

They requested a transfer from overnight to the 08:00-14:00 morning shift. Twenty-four hours a week. Reasonable hours. Human hours.

*Your request has been submitted and will be reviewed within 5-7 business days.*

And then, because Yuki had worked in the corporate machine long enough to know hope was a liability, they also submitted a full resignation. Just in case. Just to have the option.

00:24.

They had six minutes to get to a job they might not have tomorrow.

Yuki grabbed their things—work shoes, ID badge, the protein bar they'd been saving because actual food still felt too expensive—and ran.

---

The overnight shift was exactly as soul-crushing as every overnight shift before it. The cafe was in Sector 11, the commercial zone, serving the few workers who had night shifts and the occasional executive who wanted coffee at 3 AM and treated service workers like automated furniture.

But Yuki's hands didn't shake as much when they made the drinks. Their customer service voice—bright, apologetic, always apologizing even when nothing was wrong—had a different quality to it. Like they were acting a part they knew they'd be leaving soon.

06:30. Shift end. Yuki usually went straight to their pod, slept for ninety minutes, then got up for the CleanSweep shift at 10:00. Sleeping in ninety-minute increments was the only way to fit three jobs into a day. They'd read somewhere that humans needed REM sleep, needed cycles, but cycles took time and time was money and money was survival.

But today they had eight hours before CleanSweep started.

Eight hours.

Yuki took the transit back to Sector 12, walked through the familiar corridors of Building 7, climbed to their pod unit on the third stack, and just... laid down.

They set an alarm for 09:00. Two and a half hours before work. Plenty of time.

And then they slept.

---

The sleep was different.

Yuki had spent four years sleeping in snatches, always with an alarm set, always with the anxiety of knowing they had to be somewhere soon. Always with the background hum of stress that said rest was borrowed time, that every minute not working was a minute they'd pay for later.

But this time, when they closed their eyes, something in their nervous system finally unclenched.

They dropped into sleep like falling. Dropped through the first stage into REM and then deeper, into the kind of sleep their body had been screaming for since they were twenty-three and took on the second job, the third job, the endless fucking hustle of just trying to exist.

The alarm went off at 09:00 and Yuki woke up gasping.

For a moment they didn't know where they were. Didn't know what day it was. Didn't know—

They'd slept. Eight and a half hours. Straight through. No interruptions. No panic wake-ups checking the time. No stress dreams about missing shifts.

Yuki laid in their pod and started crying.

Not sad crying. Not scared crying. Just... release. The kind of crying that happened when your body finally felt safe enough to let go of something it had been holding for years.

They cried for five minutes, wiping their face on their sleeve, laughing a little because this was insane, wasn't it? Crying because they slept? But their chest felt lighter. Their hands weren't shaking. The constant background static of anxiety had quieted to something manageable.

09:15. Forty-five minutes before CleanSweep.

Yuki got up, actually took a shower instead of just running wet hands through their hair, ate breakfast—actual breakfast, not a protein bar, but rice and eggs they'd bought with the mysterious money—and walked to work.

They arrived early. For the first time in recent memory, they weren't running on panic and caffeine. They were just... there. Present. Awake in a way that felt new.

The CleanSweep supervisor, a tired woman named Indira who'd always been decent to them, looked up from her tablet. "Tanaka. You're early."

"Sorry! I mean, yeah, I know, I'm usually right on time but I actually slept and—" Yuki stopped, took a breath. The words still came too fast when they were anxious, but the anxiety itself was muted. "I slept. For the first time in years, I actually slept."

Indira's expression softened. "The money came again?"

"Yeah. Three months now."

"And you're quitting the other jobs?"

Yuki nodded. "I think so. I'm sorry, I know that sounds like—like I'm being lazy or—"

"Tanaka." Indira set down her tablet. "You work harder than anyone I know. You've been running on empty for years. If you can finally get some rest, that's not lazy. That's just... human."

The word hung in the air. Human. When had that stopped being part of the equation?

"I like this job," Yuki said, and meant it. "I like cleaning. I like making things better than I found them. I like that I can see the results at the end of the day. I just... I can't do three jobs anymore. I can't do the overnight. I can't—"

"You don't have to explain." Indira picked up her tablet again. "You want to keep this one?"

"If that's okay? I'm sorry, I don't mean to—"

"Tanaka. Stop apologizing. You want the job, you've got the job. Twenty hours a week, 10:00 to 14:00, five days. Pays 800 credits a month." She paused. "Which I'm guessing isn't enough to live on."

"It is now," Yuki said quietly. "With the money. It is now."

---

The resignation confirmations came through that evening. DataSort Inc processed immediately with a cheerful message about "successful workforce reallocation." ProspectCafe took four days but eventually confirmed: overnight shift resignation accepted, no morning shift positions available.

Yuki didn't mind. One job was enough. One job they actually chose, actually wanted to do.

The first week of the new schedule felt like living in someone else's life. Yuki woke up at 08:00—not 23:00 for overnight shift, not 04:00 for a pre-dawn commute—but 08:00 like a normal person. They had breakfast. They went to work. They came home at 14:30 and had an entire afternoon and evening stretching ahead of them.

The first day they didn't know what to do with it. Just stood in the common area of Building 7 staring at the walls.

Marcus found them there. "You alright?"

"I have free time," Yuki said. "Like, hours of it. I don't know what people do with free time?"

Marcus laughed, the sound warm and surprised. "Whatever you want, kid. That's the whole point."

Whatever they wanted. The concept was foreign.

Yuki started small. Went to the library corner in the common area—someone had built it from donated books and old tablets—and just read. For pleasure. Not for work training or skills development or productivity improvement. Just because they wanted to.

They read for two hours and nobody stopped them. Nobody said it was a waste. Nobody monitored their productivity.

The anxiety kept expecting punishment that never came.

By the second week, Yuki's body started to remember what normal circadian rhythms felt like. They woke up naturally around 07:30. Fell asleep around 22:00. Eight, sometimes nine hours a night. The chronic exhaustion that had been their baseline for years started to lift like fog burning off in sunlight.

Their hands stopped shaking. Their stomach settled. The tension headaches that had been constant faded to occasional. They stopped taking the Leveler they'd been using to manage the anxiety because—and this felt like a miracle—they didn't need it anymore.

Three weeks in, Yuki noticed they were humming while they worked. Actually humming. They couldn't remember the last time they'd had enough energy for music.

Indira noticed too. "You look different."

"I feel different. I feel like—" Yuki searched for words. "I feel like I've been holding my breath for four years and I finally exhaled."

"The money's still coming?"

"Every month. I don't know why. I don't know how. But it keeps coming."

"You think it'll last?"

Yuki considered this. A month ago they would have spiraled into anxiety, catastrophizing every possible way it could end. But now, rested and fed and safe, they could think clearly enough to be honest.

"I don't know," they said. "Maybe not. But I have savings now. And I know I can live on less. And I know—" They paused, surprising themselves with the certainty. "I know I can't go back to how things were. Even if the money stops, I can't go back to three jobs and no sleep and just surviving. I'd rather... I don't know. I'd rather find another way."

"There's always another way," Indira said quietly. "We just never had the space to look for it."

---

Month four, the money came. Month five. Month six.

Yuki stopped waiting for it to disappear and started living like it might continue.

They got a haircut. A real one, not the hack job they did themselves with kitchen scissors. They bought clothes that fit instead of whatever was cheapest. They went to a community art class in the common area and discovered they liked drawing. Had a knack for it, even.

The instructor, a retired architect named Liu, looked at Yuki's sketches of the station corridors and said, "You have an eye for this. You should keep going."

"I've never had time for hobbies," Yuki admitted.

"Well," Liu said, "you have time now."

They did. They had time. Time to sleep and eat and shower and read and draw and think and just exist without constantly calculating whether each moment was productive enough to justify taking up space.

Sometimes Yuki would wake up in the middle of the night—old habits, old anxiety—and panic that they'd missed a shift. Then they'd remember: they only had one job. And it started at 10:00. And they could go back to sleep.

So they did.

The person they were becoming felt fragile and new. Like something that could shatter if the money stopped. But every morning when they woke up rested, every afternoon when they had energy to do something besides collapse, every evening when they could choose how to spend their time—that person became a little more real.

At the end of month three of the new schedule, Yuki ran into Chen in the common area. Chen looked different too—less gaunt, more present—and when they made eye contact, they both started laughing.

"We quit," Chen said.

"We quit," Yuki agreed.

"And we're still alive."

"We're still alive."

They sat together in silence, two people who'd been drowning and now could breathe, still amazed by the simple fact of air in their lungs.

"Do you know who's sending the money?" Yuki asked eventually.

Chen shrugged. "Does it matter?"

"I think about it sometimes. What kind of person just... gives people money. For nothing. No strings."

"Maybe someone who knows what it's like to have nothing," Chen said. "Or maybe someone who doesn't. Maybe that's not the point."

"What is the point?"

Chen considered this. "That we get to find out what we'd do if we weren't just surviving all the time. That's something, right? That's data or whatever. Someone wants to know what happens when people like us get to breathe."

"What happens," Yuki said slowly, "is we become people."

"Yeah," Chen said. "Yeah, exactly that."

Yuki went back to their pod that night and laid down in the dark, thinking about the person they'd been and the person they were becoming. Thinking about sleep and art and choice and all the small ways their life had transformed.

The money might stop. Probably would stop, eventually. Everything did.

But they couldn't unknow what they'd learned: that rest was possible. That work could be something you chose, not something that consumed you. That they were more than their productivity, more than their hustle, more than the sum of their labor hours.

They were a person who liked art and sleep and making things clean. A person who could be kind to themselves. A person who deserved to exist without constantly apologizing for taking up space.

The money had given them that. Or maybe it had just cleared away enough survival panic for them to remember they'd always been that person, just buried under years of exhaustion.

Either way, Yuki thought as they drifted toward sleep, that was worth something.

That was worth everything.
