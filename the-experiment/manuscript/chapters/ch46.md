# Chapter 46: Seeding Cooperatives

Reed had seventy-three thousand credits left—Amara's life savings, freely given—and six weeks to live if Dr. Chen's timeline was accurate.

He was going to spend every credit and every day building what came after him.

The meeting happened in Marcus Ibrahim's apartment because Reed's place was under corporate surveillance. Twenty-three people crowded into a space meant for eight: community organizers from Sector 12, labor coordinators from the cross-sector strikes, economic planners who'd been studying cooperative models for two years.

And Amara, documenting everything.

"The UBI is gone," Reed said without preamble. His voice was rougher these days, kidneys failing to process the toxins that Leveler couldn't quite suppress anymore. "But we have resources, knowledge, and time to seed something that doesn't need me."

He pulled up a financial model on a borrowed terminal. "Seventy-three thousand credits. Here's how we spend it."

The proposal was meticulous. Reed had spent three weeks calculating, modeling, consulting with economists Amara knew, studying historical cooperative movements. Not charity. Structure.

"Twenty thousand for worker cooperative seed funding," he explained. "Micro-loans for groups wanting to start collectively owned businesses. You repay into a community fund that finances the next cooperative. Self-sustaining."

Yuki raised a hand. "Like the art studio loan program, but systematic?"

"Exactly. You've proven it works. We scale it."

"Fifteen thousand for union coordination funds," Reed continued. "The cross-sector organizing needs communications infrastructure, meeting spaces, legal support for collective bargaining. This buys you six months of operating costs while you establish dues structures."

Marcus nodded slowly. "We've been trying to organize without funds. This would..."

"This would give you the runway to build something permanent."

"Twenty thousand for mutual aid networks," Reed said. "Emergency food distribution, childcare collectives, medical cost-sharing. Things that help people survive when corporate cuts services. The Sector 8 model you've been piloting."

Shen, who ran the childcare cooperative, leaned forward. "That would let us expand to three more sectors. Get enough families participating that we could pay facilitators fairly instead of relying on volunteers burning out."

"That's the idea. Sustainable. Not dependent on heroic effort."

Reed's hands shook as he pulled up the next section. "Ten thousand for educational cooperatives. You're already teaching repair work, organizing skills, cooperative economics. This funds materials, space rental, teacher stipends. Knowledge transfer to the next generation."

"And the remaining eight thousand?" someone asked.

"Documentation and legal defense. Making sure what we've built is recorded, protected, legally structured so corporate can't dismantle it easily. Amara's project gets funding. We hire movement lawyers. We preserve the truth."

The room was quiet. Reed looked at twenty-three faces—people who'd spent five years watching an anonymous benefactor give them security, then watched that same person spend his dying months giving them tools for autonomy.

"This isn't charity," Reed said. "This is infrastructure. You've proven you can organize, cooperate, build alternatives. I'm just... I'm putting resources where they'll multiply. Where they'll outlast me."

"How long do you have?" Marcus asked quietly.

"Six weeks. Maybe less. Kidneys are at eighteen percent now. Leveler isn't processing right anymore. I'm..." Reed trailed off. Started again. "I'm on borrowed time. So let's use it well."

Amara stood. "I want to add something. Reed's giving you his last resources. But the real wealth here is what you've already built. Five years of learning to cooperate. Of building trust across sector lines. Of remembering you're human beings who deserve dignity. That's worth more than seventy-three thousand credits."

"The cooperatives work because you worked them," she continued. "The strikes succeeded because you organized them. Sector 12 thrived because you built community. Reed gave you breathing room. You gave yourselves a future."

Yuki wiped their eyes. "So what do we do?"

"We accept the seed funding," Marcus said. "We build the structures. We make sure that when Reed's gone, the movement isn't." He looked at Reed. "And we make damn sure his name is remembered for starting something real, not just giving money."

"I don't need to be remembered," Reed said.

"Too bad." Yuki smiled through tears. "You're getting remembered anyway. Deal with it."

The working groups formed immediately. Twenty-three people breaking into teams: cooperative business planning, union infrastructure, mutual aid logistics, educational programming, legal documentation.

Reed watched them work. This was what it looked like when people had resources and agency. Not dependent. Not passive. Not waiting for a benefactor.

Building for themselves.

The first cooperative opened four days later. Sector 12 Repair Collective—six workers pooling skills and tools, operating as equal owners. Marcus was one of them, teaching two younger workers the old techniques while learning new ones from them.

"We're charging fair rates," Marcus explained to Reed and Amara. "Twenty percent below corporate repair services but paying ourselves actual living wages. And ten percent of profits go back to the seed fund for the next cooperative."

"How's demand?" Amara asked, recording.

"We're booked three weeks out. Turns out when you charge fairly and do good work, people want to hire you." Marcus smiled. "Corporate repair gouges people. We don't. Word spreads."

Reed watched Marcus work—hands steady despite decades of labor damage, teaching a twenty-three-year-old how to diagnose station infrastructure problems. The kid was sharp, asking good questions, learning fast.

This was the transfer that mattered. Knowledge. Skills. The understanding that workers could own their own labor.

"You're good at this," Reed said.

Marcus laughed. "I've been doing repairs for forty years. Just never got to keep the value I created before." He tightened a fitting, checked the pressure. "That's the difference, you know? UBI let us breathe. Cooperatives let us build. Both matter."

"But only one sustains after I'm gone."

"No," Marcus said firmly. "UBI showed us we deserved better. Cooperatives are us taking it. Both were necessary. Don't diminish what you did."

Reed's terminal chimed. Another cooperative registering—Sector 15 Food Distribution Collective. Then another—Sector 23 Childcare Cooperative. Then another.

The seventy-three thousand credits were multiplying in real-time. Cooperatives funded by the seed money were already generating surplus to fund the next ones. The model was working.

"It's happening faster than projected," Amara said, checking her data. "You funded twelve cooperatives. They've already spawned seventeen more through peer funding and community investment."

"People want alternatives," Reed said. "We just gave them the tools to build them."

His hands shook harder. He took Leveler, but the steadiness didn't come. His body was losing the ability to process it. Soon it wouldn't work at all.

Soon he wouldn't work at all.

But the cooperatives would.

---

Three weeks after the seed funding distribution, Sector 12 had thirty-eight active cooperatives. Across the station, worker-owned businesses numbered over a hundred. The union coordination fund had enabled the first successful collective bargaining agreement in station history—Sector 8 waste processing workers winning safer conditions and shared profit.

Reed watched it cascade from his apartment, too sick now to attend meetings in person. Amara brought him updates, documented his responses, kept building the record.

"You're dying," she said one evening, not a question.

"Yeah." Reed's voice was barely above a whisper. "Kidneys at eleven percent. Maybe a week. Maybe less."

"You did it."

"Did what?"

"Proved the system wrong. Showed people could thrive. Built infrastructure that survives you. Made your brother's death mean something." Amara's voice cracked. "Reed, you did it."

Reed looked out at Sector 12. At thirty-eight cooperatives operating. At kids playing in common areas their parents had time to supervise. At murals showing hands reaching upward, breaking through.

At a world that was microscopically better because he'd stolen corporate money and given it away on a whim.

"Marco should have lived to see this," he said.

"Marco's death made you desperate enough to try. His life mattered. His death mattered. And what you built from that grief—" Amara took his shaking hand. "It's everything."

Reed closed his eyes. The Leveler wasn't working anymore. His hands shook constantly. Pain was starting to break through.

A week left. Maybe less.

But the cooperatives didn't need another week.

They were already sustainable.

He'd done what he meant to do.
