# Chapter 13: The Sociologist Arrives

Dr. Amara Osei stood at the entrance to Sector 12 and felt the familiar weight of returning to a place that wasn't quite home but wasn't quite foreign either. The corridors looked like Sector 8—the mid-level worker residential where she'd grown up—but more worn down. More tired. The difference between barely making it and not making it at all, measured in the quality of lighting and the frequency of maintenance.

She'd spent six years escaping Sector 8. Four years of undergraduate on loans she was still paying off, three years of graduate school working three jobs, two years of her doctorate doing research that carefully avoided anything too critical of the system that funded her department. Every step calibrated to climb away from poverty without ever acknowledging she was climbing over the people she'd left behind.

And now she was back. Not to Sector 8, but close enough. Coming to study the people she used to be.

The guilt was familiar. Amara had been carrying it for a decade.

"Dr. Osei?"

A woman approached—mid-thirties, practical clothes, the ID badge of Sector 12's Community Relations office. A position that probably paid badly and existed mostly to interface with corporate when corporate remembered these sectors existed.

"Yes, hello." Amara extended her hand, already slipping into professional mode. "Thank you for facilitating this research opportunity. I recognize this is—the situation is sensitive, and I want to ensure that—" She stopped, hearing herself. Took a breath. "Sorry. I'm grateful you're letting me be here."

The woman smiled slightly. "I'm Keisha. I'll show you the community center where you can set up. Fair warning: people are suspicious of outsiders right now. Corporate media's been saying some things."

"I saw the broadcasts." Amara fell into step beside Keisha. "I should clarify—my research isn't funded by Corporate Media or the Board. I'm with Nova Station University, Department of Social Sciences. We study—" Academic jargon rising. She pushed it down. "We study what happens to communities under different economic conditions."

"And Sector 12 is a different economic condition."

"It appears to be." Amara pulled out her tablet, already noting observations. Corridor maintenance: adequate but minimal. Air quality: baseline regulation. People: present in common spaces at times they should be at work. "The corporate narrative is that labor participation has collapsed and crime has increased. But the preliminary data I've seen suggests—may I ask, has crime actually increased?"

"Down sixty-seven percent since the money started," Keisha said flatly. "But CMN didn't ask us. They interviewed managers from other sectors."

"Interesting."

The word came out automatically, the way it always did when Amara encountered data that disturbed her. Her dissertation advisor had pointed it out years ago: "You say 'interesting' like other people say 'fuck.'" An emotional buffer. Academic distance from things that hurt to see clearly.

Crime down sixty-seven percent was interesting. It was also damning evidence that the corporate narrative was constructed rather than reported.

They entered Building 7's community center. Amara had expected empty space, maybe a few scattered people watching screens. Instead, the room hummed with activity. Art class in one corner. Children doing homework at communal tables. Someone teaching what looked like basic coding. A community garden visible through the windows—actual plants, actual food, growing in a sector that wasn't supposed to have resources for that.

"This is..." Amara trailed off. Searched for the right word. "Vibrant. The media coverage suggested social collapse."

"The media lied," said a voice behind her.

Amara turned. A man in his mid-forties, Black, Middle Eastern features, moving carefully like someone managing chronic pain. His eyes were sharp despite the physical limitation. Assessing her.

"Marcus Ibrahim," he introduced himself. "I've lived here twenty years. Worked waste processing for thirty. I'm guessing you're the researcher."

"Dr. Amara Osei. Sociology. I'm here to—" She stopped herself from the academic explanation. "I want to understand what's actually happening here. Not the corporate version. The reality."

Marcus studied her. "You from around here? Originally?"

The question hit harder than it should. "Sector 8. Worked my way out through education."

"And now you're back to study the ones who didn't make it out."

It wasn't said cruelly, but it landed like a diagnosis. Amara felt the guilt rise sharp and familiar. "I know how that sounds. I know it's—there's a power dynamic here that's problematic. I'm benefiting from studying suffering. But I want to—" She forced honesty. "I want to document what's actually happening. If the data contradicts the corporate narrative, if I can publish research that shows—"

"That poor people aren't lazy when given money?" Marcus's expression was unreadable. "In my experience, the people who need that proven are the ones who'll never believe it anyway."

"Maybe," Amara said. "But data can change policy. Can create pressure. Can—" She stopped. Heard the desperation in her own voice to believe research mattered, that observation could lead to change. "I want to try."

Marcus nodded slowly. "Then I'll help. But you talk to real people, yeah? Not just statistics. Not just data points. People."

"Of course. That's—yes. Qualitative research is essential for—" Academic language again. "Yes. I want to hear people's stories."

"Good." Marcus gestured to the room. "Then start hearing."

Over the next three days, Amara set up her research station in the community center. Laptop, recording equipment, consent forms, interview schedules. The infrastructure of turning human experience into analyzable data.

She'd done this before—studied communities, documented poverty, written papers about systemic inequality. But always with the safety of academic distance. Always observing from outside the thing she was studying.

Sector 12 felt different. Or maybe Amara felt different. Closer to it. More aware that she'd been here once, could have stayed here, was only on the other side of the interview table because of luck and loans and a prosperity score that had let her climb out.

The first formal interview was with a person named Yuki Tanaka. Non-binary, late twenties, nervous energy but directed rather than frantic. They arrived ten minutes early with a sketchbook and apologies.

"Sorry, I know you said 14:00 but I finished at the—sorry, is early okay? I can come back. Sorry."

"Early is fine." Amara smiled, trying to project safety. "Thank you for agreeing to talk with me. I want to understand—can you tell me about your experience over the last seven months? Whatever feels relevant to you."

Yuki nodded. Took a breath. Started talking quickly. "So I had three jobs, okay? I worked sixty-eight hours a week for like four years and I made 1,800 credits a month and I had anxiety disorder but couldn't afford treatment and I slept ninety minutes at a time and then the money came and I—sorry, am I talking too fast?"

"You're fine. Take your time."

"Right. Sorry. So the money came and it was 2,000 credits for nothing and I thought it was a scam but it kept coming and I quit two jobs and kept the one I actually liked and I started sleeping and the anxiety got better and I found out I like art? Like I'm good at it? I never knew because I never had time to try anything."

Amara made notes, trying to capture both the content and the affect. Yuki's speech patterns, the apologizing, the transformation they were describing. "And what does your life look like now? Compared to seven months ago?"

"I work twenty hours a week doing cleaning because I actually like making things better. I paint. I teach kids art. I sleep eight hours a night. I have friends. I'm—" Yuki stopped. Laughed, a little disbelieving. "I'm happy? Is that allowed? Am I allowed to say I'm happy?"

"What makes you think you wouldn't be allowed?"

"Because the media says we're lazy and entitled and destroying the social contract. Because I'm not working sixty-eight hours anymore so obviously I'm a parasite?"

Amara noted the internalized messaging. The way corporate propaganda had worked its way into self-perception even as Yuki actively rejected it. "Do you feel like a parasite?"

"No. I feel human. I feel like I finally get to be a person instead of just labor hours."

The statement was delivered simply, without drama, but it hit Amara hard. *Labor hours instead of a person.* That would be the pull quote, the sound bite that captured everything.

"That's a powerful distinction," she said carefully. "Can you elaborate on—what does being a person mean, versus being labor hours?"

Yuki thought about this. "Labor hours means you exist to produce. Every moment is measured by productivity. Are you working? Are you improving your skills? Are you networking? Are you optimizing? And if you're not, you're wasting time. Wasting your life."

"And being a person?"

"Means you exist because you exist. You have value without productivity. You can make art nobody buys. You can help kids learn. You can just sit and watch people and think about stuff. And that's okay. That's allowed."

Amara wrote: *Value without productivity = core transformation. Permission to exist vs obligation to justify existence.*

They talked for another hour. Amara asked about health, relationships, future plans, fears. Yuki answered honestly, occasionally apologizing for rambling, occasionally stopping to sketch while thinking through a question.

When the interview ended, Amara sat with her notes and felt something crack open in her chest. This was good data. Career-making data. Evidence of a natural experiment in universal basic income that could reshape the entire field of economic sociology.

And it was also Yuki. A person who'd been ground down by poverty and was now blooming. A person who deserved more than to be data in Amara's research.

The contradiction sat heavy.

The second interview was with Marcus. He'd suggested it himself, arrived exactly on time, settled into the chair with the careful movement of managed pain.

"You're recording?" he asked.

"Yes. With your consent." Amara pushed the form across. "Everything is confidential. Your name will be anonymized in any publication. You can stop at any time."

Marcus signed without reading. "I've got nothing to hide. And I want this on record."

"Can you start by telling me about your life before the transfers began?"

"I worked thirty years in waste processing," Marcus said slowly, thoughtfully. "Station's dirty work. Hauling refuse, processing recycling, maintaining the systems that keep everything from drowning in trash. It destroyed my body. Back, shoulders, knees, lungs. By the time I was forty-five, I could barely move. And the station's healthcare system said I had 'pre-optimal wellness status.' Too broken to work well, not broken enough to qualify for treatment I could afford."

Amara nodded, taking notes. The clinical language of suffering. "And how did that impact your daily life?"

"I had two kids. Worked through the pain because that's what you do. Took Leveler to function. Watched my children inherit poverty because I couldn't afford to give them anything else. School materials, tutoring, activities—all of it locked behind paywalls I couldn't reach."

"And when the money started?"

Marcus's expression shifted. Something that might have been wonder. "I could afford real pain medication. First time in eight years I slept through the night. Could be present with my kids instead of just surviving near them. Bought them tutoring. They're thriving now. My daughter made honor roll. My son built a robot."

"That must feel significant."

"It feels like proof," Marcus said. "Proof that we're not broken. The system's broken. My kids aren't stupid—they just needed resources. I'm not lazy—I just needed to not be in constant pain. Remove the immediate survival crisis and people do fine. Better than fine."

Amara wrote: *System attribution vs personal attribution. Participants recognize structural causes, reject individual pathology frame.*

"The corporate media narrative," she said carefully, "suggests that receiving money without working leads to moral decline. What's your response to that?"

Marcus laughed, sharp and bitter. "In my experience, the people worried about moral decline are the ones who've never had to choose between food and medicine. Work doesn't build character—it builds desperation. The money didn't make us lazy. It made us able to choose. And when we can choose, we choose community. Choose creativity. Choose to be human."

The interview lasted two hours. Marcus talked about union organizing before corporations crushed collective bargaining. About watching the system grind down everyone he knew. About the community mutual aid networks forming now that people had capacity.

When it ended, Amara had pages of notes and the growing sense that she was documenting something important. Something that contradicted every corporate assumption about human nature and labor and worth.

Something that would make her career and also might get her defunded.

---

By the end of the first week, Amara had interviewed twelve residents. Each conversation reinforced the same patterns:

- Labor participation down, but satisfaction and health up
- Crime down, community cohesion up
- People working less but contributing more through volunteer work and mutual aid
- Unanimous rejection of "laziness" narrative
- Consistent framing of money as freedom from coercion, not incentive to do nothing

The data was remarkable. The data was also dangerous.

Amara sat in the community center after hours, laptop open, staring at her preliminary findings. This was thesis material. Book material. Research that could reshape how economists and policymakers thought about poverty and labor and human motivation.

It was also research that directly contradicted the corporate narrative. That proved the system wrong.

Her department was corporate-funded. Her position depended on not being too controversial. Her student loans required steady income. Her prosperity score would drop if she lost her job.

Amara thought about Sector 8. About her family still there, still struggling. About the guilt she carried for escaping while others couldn't. About whether research that didn't threaten the system could ever actually change anything.

She thought about Yuki saying: *I feel human.*

About Marcus saying: *Proof that we're not broken. The system's broken.*

About all the ways academic objectivity was sometimes just cowardice with credentials.

Her tablet buzzed. Email from her department head: *How's the Sector 12 research? Board is interested in preliminary findings. Can you send an early summary?*

The Board. Corporate. The people who'd commissioned the hit pieces and announced the "support measures" to make Sector 12 suffer.

Amara stared at the email. Then at her notes. Then at the community center around her, still warm with the presence of people who'd been here hours ago, making art and teaching kids and building something better in the wreckage of a broken system.

She typed: *Still in early data collection phase. Will send comprehensive findings when analysis is complete.*

Vague enough to buy time. Honest enough to not be lying.

She didn't know what she'd do when the analysis was complete. Whether she'd tell the truth or tell the version that kept her funded. Whether observation would lead to action or just to another academic paper that changed nothing.

But she knew she couldn't send preliminary data to the Board yet. Not when the data proved they were lying. Not when sending it might let them shut everything down before Amara fully understood what was happening.

She closed the laptop. Sat in the quiet community center. Thought about the difference between studying suffering and ending it.

Thought about whether she'd always be someone who watched from the outside, or if maybe—finally—she could be someone who used her position to fight.

The question sat heavy.

She didn't have an answer yet.

But for now, she'd keep documenting. Keep listening. Keep seeing these people as people, not just data points.

And maybe that was enough.

For now.
