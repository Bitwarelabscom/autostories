# Chapter 21: Two Years On

Reed's hands shook as he transferred the monthly payments. Not from the Leveler—he'd taken his dose three hours ago, right on schedule—but from the numbers staring back at him from the encrypted terminal.

Eighteen months of operating funds remaining. Maybe twenty if he cut back on the security measures that kept corporate forensics off his trail.

Thirty-five years old and counting down to zero.

He hit send. Three hundred and forty-seven accounts in Sector 12. Two thousand credits each. Six hundred ninety-four thousand credits gone in the time it took his worn keyboard to process the command. The remaining balance blinked at him: 12,450,000 SC.

Twenty-four months ago, that number had been 247,000,000.

"Optimization of resource allocation," as Executive Director Harris had called it in last week's station-wide address, "requires difficult choices about misallocated funds in certain sectors."

Translation: Corporate was bleeding Reed faster than he'd thought possible.

The terminal chimed. Reed's daily news aggregator had finished compiling. He pulled up the feed, already knowing what he'd find.

**SECTOR 15 PROTESTS ENTER THIRD WEEK**
*"We just want what Sector 12 has," says spokesperson*

**BOARD ANNOUNCES NEW "PROSPERITY ASSESSMENT" FEES FOR SECTORS 8, 15, 23**
*Director Harris: "Ensuring fair distribution of station resources"*

**THE MYSTERY OF SECTOR 12: TWO YEARS LATER, QUESTIONS REMAIN**
*Who is funding the anomaly? Why? And can it last?*

Reed closed the last article without reading it. He'd read seventeen variations this week alone. The trial—four months of legal theater that couldn't prove he was the source of the money—had made him temporarily famous. The acquittal on lack of evidence had made him permanently suspect.

Now everyone in Sector 12 knew his face. Half of them thought he was the benefactor. The other half thought he was the corporate plant sent to document their "laziness" for propaganda purposes.

He was too tired to care which anymore.

A message popped up on his encrypted channel. Dr. Amara Osei, right on schedule.

*A: Morning. How are you holding up?*

Reed laughed. The sound came out wrong, too sharp in his empty apartment. He typed: *Define "holding up."*

*A: That bad?*

*R: Eighteen months left. Maybe twenty. Corporate's getting creative with sector-wide fee structures. They're targeting 8, 15, and 23 now—the ones organizing protests.*

*A: I saw. They're calling it "fairness optimization."*

*R: Everything's optimization when you're grinding people into paste.*

A pause. Reed watched the cursor blink. He and Amara had been doing this dance for two years now—ever since the trial, when she'd testified about her research and corporate had tried to discredit her credentials on live broadcast. She'd published anyway. Her book, *Sector 12: A Study in Human Thriving*, was in its third printing.

Corporate had banned it from official station bookstores. The black market couldn't print copies fast enough.

*A: Have you seen the health data from this quarter?*

*R: Send it.*

The file appeared. Reed opened it, scanning Amara's meticulous documentation. Sector 12, Month 38 of the experiment:

- Crime down 71% from baseline
- Emergency medical calls down 79%
- Educational enrollment up 412%
- New business registrations up 203%
- Leveler addiction down 34%

That last one made Reed's chest tight. He'd been using more, not less. Stress had a way of justifying things.

*A: You should see what's happening with community formation. People are organizing. Mutual aid networks, cooperative childcare, skill-sharing groups. Marcus Ibrahim is teaching repair work to anyone who wants to learn.*

Reed remembered Marcus. Bought Leveler from him in the old days, back when Marcus could barely walk from the pain. Now, according to Amara's research, Marcus was running community workshops three times a week.

*R: And the other sectors?*

*A: That's where it gets interesting. Even without UBI, they're organizing. Sector 15 has started a food cooperative. Sector 23 is running collective childcare. They're copying Sector 12's community structures even without the money.*

Reed read the message twice. Three times.

*R: So the money was just the catalyst.*

*A: The money bought them TIME. Time to think, to organize, to remember they're human beings instead of productivity metrics. But what they're doing with that time? That's all them.*

The apartment felt smaller. Reed stood up, paced to the window, looked out at Sector 12's morning shift change. Fewer people rushing to catch transit. More people walking together, talking. A new mural had appeared on Building 4's west wall—something about solidarity, rendered in colors Reed hadn't seen in Sector 12 before. Someone had time to make art.

His brother Marco had liked art. Sketched things in the margins of his work schedules, back when he had twelve-hour shifts and dreams of saving enough to take a painting class someday.

Marco had died at twenty-five without ever taking that class.

Reed's terminal chimed. Another message, this one from his security monitoring system.

**ALERT: Corporate forensic audit detected on payment routing. Layer 7 encryption holding. Recommend additional obfuscation protocols.**

He should be scared. He should be planning his next move, shoring up his defenses, preparing for the inevitable.

Instead, he felt nothing. Just the familiar weight of exhaustion and the distant buzz of Leveler keeping his hands steady enough to type.

*R: I'm running out of time. The money, I mean. Not... the other thing.*

*A: What other thing?*

*R: Never mind.*

Another pause. Longer this time. Reed watched people moving in Sector 12's morning light. Yuki Tanaka walking to their art studio—opened six months ago, funded by a community micro-loan. Kids playing in the Section C common area, their parents taking turns on supervision rather than all scrambling to work.

Marcus Ibrahim on his morning walk, moving better since he could afford decent pain management.

All of it running on borrowed time and Reed's borrowed money.

*A: You still there?*

*R: Yeah. Just thinking.*

*A: Dangerous habit.*

*R: Says the woman who published a book calling corporate's economic system "deliberately malicious."*

*A: I said "systematically extractive." The media added "malicious."*

*R: The media loves adding things.*

His terminal chimed again. This time it was the station news feed, lighting up with breaking coverage:

**SECTOR 8 WORKERS ANNOUNCE STATION-WIDE LABOR COORDINATION MEETING**
*"Inspired by Sector 12's transformation, workers across five sectors demand basic economic security"*

Reed stared at the headline. Five sectors. Thousands of workers. All of them organizing around an idea that had started with his desperate, drugged-up impulse to give away stolen money.

*A: Are you seeing this?*

*R: Yeah.*

*A: This is bigger than the money now. You know that, right?*

Reed didn't know what he knew anymore. He knew he was tired. He knew his kidneys were processing too much Leveler and probably starting to fail. He knew corporate was closing in on his money trail with algorithms more sophisticated than his encryption.

He knew Sector 12 looked different than it had three years ago. Lighter, somehow. Like someone had turned up the air quality and people could finally breathe.

*R: Eighteen months. Then it's over.*

*A: Then we figure out what comes next.*

*R: We?*

*A: Did you think I was just documenting this for a book? Reed, I've been tracking you for two years. I know your routing patterns, your security protocols, probably your coffee order if you ever ordered coffee anymore.*

Reed laughed again. This time it sounded almost human.

*R: So you know I'm dying.*

The cursor blinked. Once. Twice. Twenty times.

*A: I know you're using more Leveler than your liver can process. I know you've lost sixteen pounds since the trial. I know you haven't left your apartment for anything except encrypted money transfers in four months.*

*R: Observant.*

*A: Professional.*

*R: So what's your professional opinion on my eighteen-month runway?*

*A: My professional opinion is that you need to start thinking about what happens when the money runs out. Because whatever you started, it's not stopping when the payments stop.*

Reed looked out at Sector 12 again. The mural on Building 4 caught the morning light. Something about hands reaching upward, breaking through something that might have been chains or might have been data streams. Hard to tell from this distance.

*R: Corporate's going to escalate. They're already targeting the organizing sectors with new fees.*

*A: Let them. The movement isn't about money anymore. It's about people remembering they deserve to be alive, not just productive.*

*R: Pretty words for someone with a tenure-track position.*

*A: Had. Past tense. They rescinded the offer after I published. Something about "ideological alignment with station values."*

Reed sat down hard. He'd been so focused on his own collapsing timeline, he hadn't asked what publishing the truth had cost Amara.

*R: Jesus. I'm sorry.*

*A: Don't be. Turns out I don't want to work for institutions that require me to lie about what makes people happy. I'm doing consulting work now. Helping the organizing sectors build economic models. Paying my rent with honesty instead of complicity.*

*A: Feels better.*

The terminal chimed with another security alert. Corporate's forensic audit was probing deeper, testing his encryption at multiple points. They were getting more aggressive.

Reed should upgrade his security. Should move his remaining funds to backup accounts. Should implement the contingency protocols he'd built for exactly this scenario.

Instead, he messaged Amara: *Want to meet?*

This time the pause was shorter.

*A: In person?*

*R: In person. I'm tired of hiding.*

*A: You sure? The moment you step outside, corporate surveillance will flag your movement patterns. They're watching Sector 12 like it's a containment site.*

*R: Let them watch. If I've only got eighteen months of money left, I'd like to spend some of it remembering what actual human contact feels like.*

*A: Rico's Café, Sector 15. One hour. Order the coffee—it's terrible but it's cheap.*

*R: I don't drink coffee.*

*A: You do now. Try living a little before the money runs out.*

The connection closed. Reed sat in his empty apartment, listening to the sounds of Sector 12 waking up outside. Somewhere a child laughed. Someone was playing music—actual music, not the mandatory corporate motivation broadcasts.

His terminal showed the remaining balance: 12,450,000 SC.

Eighteen months until zero.

Reed stood up. Found his jacket—the one that didn't have corporate surveillance tags sewn into the lining. Checked his pockets for credits he didn't need to spend. Looked at himself in the mirror.

Thirty-five years old. Latino kid from Sector 12 who'd watched his brother die, dealt drugs, stole corporate money, and accidentally started a revolution.

He looked like shit.

But he looked alive.

Reed left the apartment for the first time in four months. The corridor lights seemed brighter than he remembered. Or maybe he'd just been in the dark too long.

In Sector 15, Dr. Amara Osei ordered two terrible coffees and waited to meet the man who'd turned her research into a revolution.

Neither of them knew they had less than eighteen months before corporate made them an offer they'd almost be too desperate to refuse.
