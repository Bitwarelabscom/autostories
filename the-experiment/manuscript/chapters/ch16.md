# Chapter 16: Corporate Escalation

The board room was on Sector 1, Executive Level, where the air quality was perfect and the gravity felt slightly lighter and everything was designed to remind you that power had physical weight. Floor-to-ceiling windows showed the curve of Mars below, red and cold and beautiful in a way that felt proprietary—like even the planet existed to serve as backdrop for corporate success.

Executive Director Jonathan Harris sat at the head of the polished table and tried to project calm authority while his stomach knotted with something that might have been doubt.

Might have been. He wasn't quite ready to name it yet.

"Let's review the Sector 12 situation," he said, his voice carrying the warm concern of someone about to solve a problem. "Jennifer, can you walk us through the updated metrics?"

Jennifer Wu, Director of Resource Allocation, pulled up the data. Charts and graphs materialized in the air above the table, holographic and damning.

"Labor force participation continues to decline," Wu said crisply. "Down forty-seven percent since the irregular transfers began. Productivity metrics in affected sectors are down thirty-eight percent. Traditional prosperity advancement has stalled completely. We're looking at a catastrophic failure of work culture."

Harris nodded, but something about the phrasing caught him. *Traditional prosperity advancement.* He'd been using phrases like that for thirty years, but lately they'd started to sound hollow. Like euphemisms. Like...

He pushed the thought away.

"And the social indicators?" he asked.

Wu scrolled to the next chart. This one showed community cohesion metrics, health outcomes, crime statistics. Everything pointing in the wrong direction from what Harris had expected.

Crime down. Health up. Community formation accelerating. Life satisfaction through the roof.

"Interesting," Wu said, using the word like a curse. "Crime has decreased sixty-seven percent. Emergency healthcare utilization is down fifty-two percent. Mental health crisis incidents down seventy-one percent. However—" She emphasized this carefully. "—these metrics may be misleading. Reduced emergency healthcare could indicate people avoiding necessary treatment due to inflated sense of security. Crime reduction might reflect underreporting rather than actual safety improvement."

Harris listened to her reframe positive outcomes as potential problems and felt that doubt-thing twist tighter in his chest. "Or," he said slowly, "it could mean people are actually healthier and safer when they're not desperate."

The room went quiet.

Wu looked at him with polite confusion. "I'm sorry?"

"Nothing." Harris smiled, the friendly-grandfather smile that made people trust him. "Continue."

Wu pulled up financial projections. "We've implemented the Sector Optimization Initiative as approved. Prosperity recalibration fees for enhanced services. Labor participation requirements. Adjusted prosperity scores for voluntary workforce reduction. We anticipated these measures would encourage residents to re-engage with traditional prosperity pathways."

"And have they?" asked Marcus Venn, the CMN anchor who sat on the board. His presence always made Harris vaguely uncomfortable—like having propaganda personified at the table.

"No," Wu admitted. "The irregular transfers appear to have increased to compensate. Residents are now receiving approximately 2,800 credits monthly, up from 2,000. Whoever is funding this has significant resources and is actively countering our interventions."

Harris's jaw tightened. "So our 'support measures' are being nullified?"

"Not entirely. The increased fees are straining the funding source. At current burn rate, they're spending..." Wu calculated. "Approximately 560,000 credits monthly. 6.72 million annually. That's unsustainable long-term."

"How long can they maintain this?"

"Unknown. We don't know the total fund size. But based on financial forensics, we believe we're close to identifying the source."

This was the moment Harris had been waiting for. Find the benefactor, stop the experiment, return Sector 12 to normal. To order. To the way things were supposed to work.

"Close?" he asked.

"Very," Wu said. "Financial analysis indicates the original capital came from irregular corporate funds. The transaction patterns suggest someone with deep knowledge of our accounting systems. Someone who knew where to look for hidden money."

"An insider," said Victoria Chen, Chief of Station Security. She'd been quiet until now, taking notes. "Someone in finance or auditing. Probably mid-level, with access but not visibility. The kind of person who could disappear money without immediate flags."

Harris thought about this. An insider. Someone in his organization who'd stolen corporate funds and used them to... to what? To prove the system wrong? To make him look foolish? To actually help people?

The last thought came unbidden and he dismissed it immediately. Corporate funds weren't for charity. They were for operations, for growth, for maintaining station prosperity. Using them for unauthorized distributions was theft, regardless of outcome.

"Keep investigating," Harris ordered. "I want a name within two weeks."

"Yes, sir." Chen made a note.

"Now," Harris continued, "let's discuss next steps. The Optimization Initiative isn't working. The funding source is compensating. What's our escalation plan?"

The room exchanged glances. This was the moment where corporate power either backed down or doubled down. Harris knew which way they'd go. They always went the same way.

"I have a proposal," said Bradley Morrison, Economic Policy Director. He was younger than Harris, sharp-edged where Harris was grandfatherly. "We've been treating this as a social problem. What if we approach it as a communications problem?"

"Explain," Harris said.

"The public narrative is currently: Sector 12 gets free money, abandons work, descends into chaos. But the data—" Morrison hesitated. "The actual data shows crime down, health up, community formation. If that gets out, if it becomes the story, we have a problem."

"It won't get out," Venn said confidently. "CMN controls the narrative."

"CMN controls broadcast media," Morrison corrected. "But there's a sociologist from Nova Station University doing research in Sector 12. Dr. Amara Osei. She's been conducting extensive interviews, collecting health data, documenting outcomes. If she publishes research showing positive results—"

"Then we discredit it," Venn interrupted. "Academic research is easy to spin. Methodological flaws, researcher bias, insufficient sample size. We've done it before."

Harris nodded slowly, but that doubt-thing was expanding. Discredit research. Reframe positive outcomes. Make success look like failure.

When had he become someone who did this?

He'd started in corporate believing he was helping people. Building prosperity. Creating opportunities. The language had all been about uplifting, empowering, enabling. But somewhere along the way, the language had stayed the same while the actions became...

Different.

Harris forced himself to focus. "What do we know about Dr. Osei?"

Morrison pulled up a profile. "Thirty-two years old. Doctorate in economic sociology. Climbed out of Sector 8 on scholarships and loans. Still paying off significant debt. Her department is corporate-funded. Her prosperity score is mid-tier but fragile—one career setback and she drops."

In other words: vulnerable. Controllable. Someone who couldn't afford to lose their position.

"We own her department?" Harris asked.

"The Prosperity Collective donates forty percent of their operating budget," Morrison confirmed. "And we sit on the university's board of directors."

Harris understood immediately. They didn't need to discredit the research. They could just make it disappear. Pressure the department, threaten funding, tank Dr. Osei's career. Make publishing dangerous enough that she'd self-censor.

Simple. Clean. Effective.

And something about it made Harris feel sick.

"Sir?" Morrison prompted.

Harris pulled himself together. "Monitor her research. If it looks like she's preparing to publish something... problematic... we'll have a conversation with the university administration."

"Just a conversation?" Morrison asked.

"A very friendly conversation," Harris said, voice warm. "About continued partnership and mutual prosperity. They'll understand."

They always understood. That was the thing about power—you rarely had to use it explicitly. Just let people know it existed and they'd police themselves.

"Now," Harris continued, "back to Sector 12 itself. The Optimization Initiative isn't working. What else can we do?"

Wu pulled up a new proposal. "We can escalate service reductions. Currently we're charging recalibration fees for enhanced air quality and water. We could expand that. Make basic maintenance request-only instead of automatic. Reduce transit access. Implement stricter prosperity score requirements for medical care."

"Make life harder," Victoria Chen said bluntly.

"Make prosperity require effort," Wu corrected, using the corporate framing automatically. "Right now Sector 12 residents are receiving resources without corresponding contribution. That creates entitlement. We need to remind them that prosperity is earned."

Harris listened to her explain how they'd systematically make people's lives worse and call it education. Call it opportunity. Call it helping them understand the value of work.

The doubt-thing in his chest had grown teeth.

"Won't that just make them more dependent on the irregular transfers?" he asked.

"Possibly," Wu admitted. "But it will also increase the burn rate for whoever's funding this. Force them to either increase payments further—which accelerates depletion—or watch the experiment fail as residents can't maintain quality of life even with transfers."

It was strategic. Elegant, even. Create conditions where the UBI either bankrupted itself or proved insufficient. Either way, corporate could claim the experiment failed.

Never mind that the failure would be manufactured.

"There's another consideration," Morrison added. "If we make Sector 12 visibly struggle, it discourages other sectors from wanting similar arrangements. The hit pieces have been effective, but seeing actual decline would be more powerful. Make Sector 12 an example of what happens when you abandon traditional prosperity pathways."

Make them suffer to discourage others. Use human beings as cautionary tales.

Harris looked around the table at his colleagues. Smart people, all of them. Dedicated. Genuinely believing they were protecting station prosperity and social order. Genuinely unable to see that they were talking about deliberately hurting people to prove a point.

Or maybe they saw it and just didn't care.

Harris thought about Sector 12. About the statistics Wu kept trying to reframe. Crime down sixty-seven percent. Health up across all metrics. People happy. Actually, measurably happy.

And corporate was sitting here planning how to make them miserable again because happiness without exhaustion threatened the system.

"Jonathan?" Wu prompted. "Do we have approval for escalated interventions?"

Harris looked at the data one more time. At the positive outcomes they were about to destroy. At the people who'd found security and peace and community. At the experiment that was working exactly as economics said it shouldn't.

At the choice between what the data showed and what the system required him to believe.

"Yes," he heard himself say. Voice warm, certain, friendly. "Proceed with escalation. But carefully. We're not punishing anyone—we're helping them understand the value of contribution. Frame it that way. Always."

"Of course," Wu said.

"And keep the investigation into the funding source priority one. The sooner we identify them, the sooner we can end this properly."

"We're close," Chen assured him. "Very close."

The meeting continued. Details about implementation timelines and messaging strategies and coordination with CMN. Harris participated automatically, saying the right things, making the right decisions, being the executive director everyone expected.

But part of him had split off. Was watching from outside. Seeing himself coordinate the systematic punishment of people whose crime was being happy. Seeing himself rationalize cruelty as education. Seeing himself choose the system over the humans it was supposed to serve.

He thought: *When did I become this?*

Then: *Have I always been this?*

---

After the meeting, Harris stood alone in the board room, looking out at Mars. The planet turned slowly, indifferent to human cruelty and kindness alike. He'd always found that comforting—the cosmic scale made individual suffering seem less significant. Made hard decisions easier because they were just adjustments to systems, not violence against people.

But lately he'd been thinking about people more. About the faces behind the statistics. About whether "pre-prosperous citizens" actually meant anything except "people we're failing."

His tablet chimed. A message from his assistant: *Dinner with Senator Williams at 19:00. Transportation confirmed.*

Back to normal. Back to the comfortable routines of power and influence and believing he was one of the good ones.

Harris took one last look at the data, still hovering in the air. Crime down. Health up. Community thriving.

All of it about to be destroyed because it proved the wrong thing.

He closed the hologram.

Told himself this was necessary.

Told himself he was helping.

Told himself he believed it.

And somewhere in Sector 12, people who'd finally learned to breathe were about to discover that breathing without permission was a punishable offense.

The machine of suffering ground on.

And Executive Director Jonathan Harris, who thought of himself as a good man, went to dinner.
