# Chapter 36: The Confrontation

Amara found him at Marco's memorial plaque.

Reed should have expected it. He'd been standing there every Tuesday for five years—same time, same position, same exhausted ritual. A surveillance algorithm could have pinpointed him in three days. Amara had probably known for weeks.

He heard her footsteps but didn't turn around.

"Reed Salazar," she said. Not a question.

"Dr. Osei." He kept staring at the plaque. Marco Salazar, 2925-2950. Twenty-five years old. "Early Resource Reallocation," according to the corporate euphemism stamped beneath his name. Like dying of overwork at twenty-five was a scheduling optimization.

"I need you to look at me."

Reed turned. Amara stood three meters away, holding a tablet against her chest like a shield. She looked tired—really tired, the kind that came from not sleeping because you'd figured out something that changed everything and didn't know what to do about it.

He knew that tired. He'd been living it for five years.

"How long have you known?" he asked.

"Three weeks. Maybe four. The economic modeling kept pointing to someone in Sector 12 with pre-experiment financial expertise who'd never received payments. Cross-referenced with black market access, pharmaceutical use patterns, and proximity to the payment origin points." She looked at her tablet. "The probability that you're the source is 94.3%."

"That's pretty specific."

"I'm good at my job."

"You are." Reed laughed, the sound dry and wrong in the memorial corridor. "So why didn't you report me three weeks ago?"

Amara looked at him for a long time. "I don't know."

The silence stretched between them. Behind Reed, Marco's plaque reflected the corridor's dim lighting. Ahead, Amara stood with four years of research in her hands and the power to end everything with a single call to station authorities.

"You should sit down," Reed said finally. "This conversation's going to take a while."

They sat on the memorial corridor floor because Reed's legs wouldn't hold him anymore and Amara looked like she'd been standing for weeks.

"Tell me," she said.

"What do you want to know?"

"Everything. From the beginning. The real version, not the myth."

So Reed told her. The courier dying in his building. The data chip. Five hundred million credits in corporate black ops funds that no one was monitoring because they were meant for things corporations didn't want documented. Getting the chip cracked. Sitting in his apartment at three in the morning, high on Leveler, staring at all that money and thinking about Marco.

"I didn't have a plan," he said. "I just... I was so tired of watching people die for no reason. My brother worked himself to death at twenty-five. Paid off sixty percent of his medical debt before his body gave out. And corporate called it 'opportunity' like he should be grateful."

"So you gave the money away."

"I gave it away to people in my building. Then the whole sector when it didn't immediately crash and burn. I kept waiting for it to fail—for people to quit their jobs and waste the money and prove that corporate was right about us."

"But they didn't."

"They didn't. They just... they breathed. They slept. They helped each other. Yuki made art. Marcus taught repair work. People remembered how to be human instead of productivity metrics." Reed looked at his hands. They were shaking again. "And I couldn't stop. Even when corporate started hunting for the source, even when I knew it would run out, I couldn't stop."

Amara was quiet. Reed watched her process the information, saw her academic brain fitting pieces together, testing the story against her data.

"The trial," she said finally. "When they arrested you the first time—"

"They couldn't prove the money came from me. My encryption held just long enough. Corporate pushed for conviction anyway but the evidence was circumstantial. Judge acquitted on technicality." Reed smiled without humor. "They knew it was me. I knew they knew. But knowing and proving are different things."

"And you went right back to it."

"What else was I going to do? The experiment was working. Sector 12 was thriving. And then the other sectors started organizing and I realized—" Reed stopped. Started again. "I realized the money was just the spark. People were doing the real work themselves."

Amara set down her tablet. Looked at Reed directly. "You're dying."

Not a question. Reed should have known she'd seen that too.

"Leveler poisoning. My kidneys are processing more than they're built for. I've probably got..." He waved a hand. "Months. A year if I'm lucky and stop using. But I can't stop using because the shaking gets worse and I need steady hands to manage the encryption and—"

"Reed."

He stopped.

"Why didn't you ask for help?"

"Who was I going to ask? Corporate? The people receiving the UBI who'd lose it if I got caught?" Reed laughed, sharp and bitter. "This was always a one-person job. I accepted that when I started."

"Did you accept that it would kill you?"

"I accepted that it would mean something."

Silence again. Amara pulled her knees up, wrapped her arms around them. She looked younger like this—not the confident researcher presenting data at conferences, but the kid from Sector 8 who'd escaped through education and carried guilt about it like a weight.

"I could report you right now," she said quietly. "Call station security, hand over my research. They'd arrest you by nightfall."

"I know."

"Your encryption is good but it's not perfect. With my data and corporate's resources, they'd break it. Freeze your accounts. The payments would stop."

"I know."

"The experiment would end. Sector 12 would lose their UBI."

"The experiment already transcended the UBI. You documented it yourself. The strikes, the cooperatives, the cross-sector organizing—that's not my money. That's people remembering their own power." Reed met her eyes. "You could end the payments tomorrow and Sector 12 would sustain. Maybe not at the same level, but they've built something real. Something that doesn't need me."

Amara looked at him for a long time. "Do you want me to report you?"

The question hit Reed somewhere unexpected. He thought about it. Really thought about it.

"Part of me does," he said honestly. "The tired part. The part that wants to stop carrying this alone. But—"

"But?"

"But I have about two million credits left. Maybe four months of payments. And I'd like to see it through to the end. Let the money run out naturally instead of getting frozen mid-transfer. Give Sector 12 time to adjust."

"That's a practical reason. What's the real one?"

Reed smiled despite everything. "You really are good at your job."

"Reed."

"The real reason is I want to know if I'm right. If the experiment worked not because of money but because of people. If everything we built can survive without me." He looked at Marco's plaque again. "I want to prove my brother died for nothing. That the system killed him when there was another way all along."

Amara followed his gaze to the memorial. Read Marco's name, the dates, the cruel brevity of a life measured in corporate efficiency.

"He was your age when he died," she said.

"Twenty-five. Yeah."

"And you were—?"

"Twenty-five when he died. I'm thirty-six now. Eleven years of watching everyone around me get ground down the same way, wondering when it would be my turn." Reed's hands shook harder. He pressed them against his knees. "Then I found the money and thought, what if I just... didn't let it happen to someone else?"

"Eleven years. You've been watching this kill people for eleven years."

"I've been living in Sector 12 my whole life. Watching it kill people is just... existence here."

Amara closed her eyes. When she opened them, something had shifted. "I'm not reporting you."

Reed's chest went tight. "You should. I'm a thief and a fraud and—"

"You're a thief and a fraud who proved the system wrong. Who gave forty-three thousand workers the template for fighting back. Who showed people they deserve to be alive." Amara picked up her tablet, looked at her data. "I've spent four years documenting what happens when people have security. Crime down 73%. Health improved 84%. Community formation up 428%. Happiness, Reed. Measurable fucking happiness."

She set the tablet down hard.

"If I report you, corporate freezes the accounts and spends the next decade burying this data. They'll say the experiment failed, that UBI makes people lazy and violent and dependent. They'll use you as proof that charity doesn't work."

"It's not charity. It's just... giving people what they should have had all along."

"I know. But corporate will call it charity, and they'll win the narrative war, and everything you've built will get twisted into propaganda." Amara looked at him. "Unless we finish this right. Document everything, prove the experiment succeeded, make sure the data survives even if the money doesn't."

"We?"

"Did you think I was going to let you die alone in an apartment documenting your own failure? Reed, I'm an academic. I'm professionally obsessed with proving corporate wrong." She smiled, exhausted and determined. "You started something incredible. Let me help you end it properly."

Reed felt something crack in his chest. He'd been alone for so long—hiding, lying, carrying the weight of five hundred million stolen credits and five years of compounding secrets.

"Why?" he asked. "Why risk your career, your safety, everything, for a dying dealer who made one impulsive choice?"

Amara reached out, covered his shaking hands with hers. Steady. Warm.

"Because you proved people deserve better. Because your brother deserved better. Because everyone ground down by this system deserves better." She squeezed his hands. "And because someone needs to make sure that when you're gone, the story they tell is true."

Reed looked at their hands. His were thin and scarred and shaking from too much Leveler and too little hope. Hers were strong and certain and choosing to hold him anyway.

"Four months of funding," he said. "Then it's over."

"Then we have four months to make sure it matters."

"Corporate's going to come for us. They already sent messages about making an offer. When I refuse—"

"When you refuse, they'll escalate. Try to discredit us, freeze assets, maybe worse." Amara didn't let go of his hands. "But they're three years too late. The movement exists. The data exists. The proof exists. They can destroy us but they can't erase what we've documented."

"You sound very certain for someone who's about to commit career suicide."

"I am committing career suicide. I accepted that when I published my first book calling corporate's system extractive." She smiled. "Turns out there are worse things than losing tenure. Like complicity."

They sat together in the memorial corridor, beneath Marco's plaque, while the station's life support hummed around them. Four months until the money ran out. Maybe six until Reed's body followed.

Somewhere on the station, workers were striking for dignity. Sector 12 was building cooperatives that didn't need Reed's credits. Yuki was teaching art classes. Marcus was passing on old union knowledge to young organizers.

The experiment was already bigger than its catalyst.

"Okay," Reed said finally. "Partners?"

"Partners," Amara agreed. "But you have to promise me something."

"What?"

"When corporate makes their offer—and they will make an offer—you tell me before you do anything. We decide together."

Reed thought about the messages he'd been ignoring. The vague promises of immunity, medical care, wealth. Everything he'd need to survive past the four-month mark.

"I'll tell you," he said. "But you should know I'm planning to refuse."

"I know. But let me help you refuse properly." Amara finally released his hands, picked up her tablet. "Now. Show me your encryption architecture. If we only have four months, I want to make sure corporate can't break it even after you're gone."

Reed stood up, offered her a hand. She took it. They walked out of the memorial corridor together—the dying dealer and the academic who'd chosen truth over safety.

Behind them, Marco's plaque gleamed in the corridor light. Twenty-five years old. Gone too soon.

But maybe, finally, not gone for nothing.
