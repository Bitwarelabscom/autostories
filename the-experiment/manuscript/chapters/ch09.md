# Chapter 9: Marcus Breathes

The pain had been Marcus Ibrahim's constant companion for so long he'd stopped thinking of it as pain. It was just the price. The cost of thirty years in waste processing, hauling containers that weighed more than a person should lift, breathing recycled air thick with particulates no filter quite caught, working twelve-hour shifts in the station's lowest sectors where gravity felt heavier and everything smelled like copper and decay.

His body was the invoice. Chronic lower back pain that radiated down his left leg. Shoulders that seized up if he lifted his arms above chest height. Three fingers on his right hand that didn't bend properly anymore after the sorting machine incident the company called an "equipment interaction event." Knees that clicked and ground with every step. Lungs that wheezed in cold air.

He was forty-five and felt seventy. Felt used up. Felt like industrial equipment that had outlived its warranty.

The station's healthcare system had a word for bodies like his: "pre-optimal wellness status." Which meant: you're broken, but not broken enough to qualify for treatment your prosperity score can afford. Take Leveler for the pain. Keep working. Die quietly.

Marcus had been taking Leveler for eight years. Not to get high—though that happened too, and god knew the high was sometimes the only break from reality—but to function. To move. To be able to stand long enough to make his kids breakfast before school.

But Leveler was expensive. Even the cheap black market stuff Reed sold cost sixty credits for a week's supply. And that was just pain management, not healing. Just enough to keep the body moving while it continued to break down.

So when the first anonymous transfer landed in Marcus's account—2,000 credits for no reason, from no one—his first thought wasn't hope.

His first thought was: I can buy the real medication.

---

The prescription pain management compound was called Somatic-7. It was legal, safe, developed by actual medical professionals instead of in somebody's bathtub. It reduced inflammation, managed nerve pain, didn't make you high or foggy or dependent. It just... worked.

It also cost 340 credits for a month's supply.

For eight years, Marcus's prosperity score had kept him locked out of the pharmacy tier that stocked it. His score was too low. His insurance was "Basic Essentials Only"—which meant he could get treated if he was literally dying, but chronic pain didn't count as dying. Chronic pain was a "quality of life issue," and quality of life was something you earned through prosperity.

The second month's transfer came. Marcus stood in his pod—twelve square meters for him and his two kids, Aisha who was fourteen and David who was twelve—and did the math.

2,000 credits. Rent was 800. Food for three people was minimum 400 if they were careful. Utilities, school fees, transit, clothes the kids were constantly growing out of. Maybe 300 more. That left 500.

He could buy Somatic-7. Could afford it and still have money left over.

Marcus looked at his hands. The missing fingers. The scars. The way they shook slightly because pain was exhausting and exhaustion was constant.

"In my experience," he said aloud to no one, using the phrase that had become his verbal tic after decades of training younger workers, "when something seems too good to be true, it's because someone's selling you something."

But nobody was selling him anything. The money just arrived. No contract. No terms. No debt.

Third month, the money came again.

Marcus bought the Somatic-7.

---

The first dose was unremarkable. The pharmacist—a tired woman behind bulletproof glass in Sector 10's medical district—scanned his ID, processed the payment, slid the bottle through the drawer.

"Take one in the morning, one at night," she said without looking at him. "With food. Effects start in three to five days."

Marcus took the first pill that night with the synthetic rice and beans he'd made for dinner. Aisha and David did their homework at the fold-down table, fighting over the single tablet they shared for school. He watched them and felt the familiar ache: they deserved better. Deserved their own tablets, their own space, their own futures that weren't predetermined by a prosperity score inherited from their broken father.

Day three of the medication, Marcus woke up and realized he'd slept through the night.

Actually slept. Not the half-conscious pain management of sleeping in positions that minimized the hurt. Not waking up every two hours when he rolled wrong and his back spasmed. Just sleep.

He sat up—a movement that usually took planning and gritted teeth—and it didn't hurt.

Didn't hurt.

Marcus stood. Walked to the tiny bathroom. Bent to splash water on his face and his back didn't seize. His shoulders moved smoothly. His knees clicked but didn't grind.

The pain wasn't gone. Thirty years of damage didn't disappear in three days. But it was... managed. Muted. Turned down from a scream to a whisper.

He started crying before he realized it was happening. Just stood there at the rust-stained sink, water running, tears cutting tracks down his face.

"Dad?" Aisha's voice from behind him, worried. "Dad, you okay?"

Marcus turned. His daughter stood in the doorway in her school uniform—the mandatory outfit that cost 200 credits and had to be replaced every time she grew, which was constantly—looking at him with his eyes in her face.

"I'm okay, habibti," he said. The Arabic endearment his own father had used, passed down like the chronic pain and the poverty. "I'm okay. Better than okay."

"You're crying."

"Yeah." He wiped his face. "In my experience, sometimes you cry because something hurts. Sometimes you cry because it stops hurting."

Aisha didn't fully understand, but she hugged him anyway. And Marcus hugged her back and lifted her off her feet a little, something he hadn't been able to do in years, and she laughed in surprise.

"You're strong today," she said.

"I'm not hurting today," he corrected. "There's a difference."

---

By the end of the first week on Somatic-7, Marcus realized the pain had been using more of his energy than he'd understood. Without the constant background drain of managing hurt, he had capacity for other things. Could think more clearly. Could be present with his kids instead of counting down the hours until he could take the next dose of Leveler and get a break.

Could remember what hope felt like.

The fourth month's money came. Marcus had been careful with the third month's excess—saved most of it, terrified the transfers would stop. But they didn't stop. 2,000 credits arrived like clockwork.

He called Aisha and David to the table. They sat, his kids, looking at him with cautious confusion. Money conversations in their house had only ever meant bad news.

"The money's still coming," Marcus said. "The anonymous money. Fourth month now."

"Is that good?" David asked. He was twelve and practical and had never known a time when they weren't poor.

"It's very good. It means we have options." Marcus pulled up his tablet, showed them the account balance. "I want to talk about school."

Both kids went still. School was a loaded topic. Mandatory education was free—technically—but everything else cost money. Materials, tablets, extracurriculars, the "optional" tutoring that wasn't optional if you wanted to pass the exams that determined your prosperity score trajectory.

Marcus and his kids had accepted years ago that they couldn't afford any of it. The kids would go to mandatory classes, do the best they could with shared resources, and probably end up in the same sectors as their father. Prosperity scores were inheritable in all but name.

"I want you both to sign up for the tutoring programs," Marcus said. "The real ones. And David, you wanted to join the robotics club. And Aisha, the debate team."

Aisha's eyes went wide. "Dad, that's 200 credits a month. Each."

"We have 2,000 credits a month. We can afford it."

"But what if the money stops?"

Marcus looked at his daughter—fourteen years old and already trained to expect nothing, to want nothing, to accept that good things weren't for people like them.

"In my experience," he said slowly, "the worst thing poverty does isn't the hunger or the pain. It's making you believe you don't deserve anything better. Making you police your own hope."

"But practically—" Aisha started.

"Practically, I've saved 1,100 credits over three months. If the money stops tomorrow, we'd still have enough for six months of tutoring. And if you can get your scores up, if you can test into better tier schools, that changes everything. Your whole trajectory."

"What about you?" David asked. "Don't you need stuff?"

Marcus thought about this. Thought about all the things his body needed. Physical therapy. Dental work. New shoes without holes. A bed instead of a sleeping mat.

"I'm getting treatment," he said. "The pain medication. That's something. That's a lot." He paused. "But you two are the investment that matters. In my experience, the way out of poverty is education and organization. I can teach you organizing—I was in the union back when stations had unions. But education, that's something I can buy you. If we're careful."

Aisha and David exchanged glances. Having a private sibling conversation in the way of kids who'd shared twelve square meters their whole lives.

"Okay," Aisha said finally. "But if the money stops, we quit the programs. Immediately."

"Deal."

David grinned. "I get to build robots?"

"You get to build robots."

His son's joy was so pure and unguarded that Marcus had to look away. When had his kids learned to expect nothing? When had he taught them that wanting things was dangerous?

---

The tutoring started the following week. Marcus walked both kids to the education center in Sector 11—a real walk, not the pained shuffle he'd been doing for years—and watched them go into their sessions.

He had two hours to kill. Normally he would have gone home, laid down, tried to manage the pain. But he didn't hurt. Not really. The background scream had faded to something manageable.

So Marcus walked.

He walked through Sector 12 like he hadn't in years. Noticed things. The common area in Building 7 was different—more people, more life. Someone had set up a library corner. Someone else was teaching an art class. People were talking, laughing, existing outside the crushing weight of survival mode.

Other people had gotten the money too. It wasn't just him.

Marcus found Reed in the corner of the common area, watching everything with that thousand-yard stare he got. Reed who sold Leveler but barely seemed present in his own life. Reed who'd sold to Marcus for three years and never once asked questions or judged.

"I'm not buying today," Marcus said, sitting down carefully. The pain medication worked but he was still learning to trust it.

"Okay," Reed said.

"I wanted to say thanks, though. For keeping the prices fair all these years. A lot of dealers, they see desperation and they charge accordingly."

Reed shrugged. "Seemed like everyone was desperate enough already."

They sat in silence. Around them, the common area hummed with activity. Yuki was in the art class, bent over a sketchpad with total focus. Chen was reading to a group of kids. Sarah Kim was actually smiling.

"You notice anything different about the sector?" Marcus asked.

"People are quitting their jobs," Reed said flatly. "Less Leveler sales. More time in common spaces. Someone started a food sharing program."

"The money. The anonymous transfers."

"Yeah."

"You know anything about it?"

Reed's expression didn't change. "Why would I know anything?"

"Because you notice things. Because you're smart, even if you pretend not to be. Because something this organized, this careful, someone local has to be running it."

"Could be anyone," Reed said.

Marcus studied him. Reed who looked exhausted and alive at the same time. Reed who watched everything and pretended to care about nothing.

"In my experience," Marcus said carefully, "the people who see the most clearly are the ones in the most pain. They can't afford illusions."

Reed laughed, sharp and bitter. "That's a hell of a theory."

"Just an observation." Marcus stood, his knees protesting but not screaming. "I bought my kids tutoring. First time in their lives they'll have the same resources as rich kids. Because of whoever's sending the money."

"That's good," Reed said. And for just a moment, something in his expression cracked open. Something that might have been hope or satisfaction or grief. Then it closed again, and he was back to the flat exhaustion.

"So whoever they are," Marcus continued, "they should know it's working. People aren't wasting it. They're transforming."

Reed nodded slowly. "They should know that. Yeah."

---

Months five and six, the money kept coming. Aisha's test scores started climbing. David built a robot that could navigate obstacles and came home glowing. Marcus kept taking the Somatic-7 and discovered that without constant pain he could think about the future instead of just surviving the present.

He started attending the community meetings that were spontaneously organizing in Building 7. Started talking about the old union days, about collective bargaining and worker power. People listened—the younger ones who'd never heard these concepts, and the older ones who remembered when labor meant something besides survival.

"This money," Marcus said at one meeting, "it's showing us something. It's proving we're not lazy, we're not worthless without work. We're just exhausted."

"But what happens when it stops?" someone asked.

"Then we organize," Marcus said. "In my experience, the system wants us too tired to fight back. Too desperate to think beyond the next shift. But if we've had rest, if we've remembered we're human—we don't forget that just because the money stops."

Yuki raised their hand, nervous. "How do we organize? I don't know how."

"I do," Marcus said. "I can teach you. Anyone who wants to learn."

Twenty people showed up to the first organizing workshop. Marcus taught them about collective action, about solidarity, about how workers only had power if they acted together. Taught them the things he'd learned in the waste processing union before the company crushed it, before collective bargaining became "workforce disruption" and got you fired.

He taught them how to breathe together.

Because that's what organizing was, in the end. Breathing together. Taking up space together. Refusing to disappear.

Marcus's body was still broken. The Somatic-7 managed the pain but couldn't undo the damage. He would never be whole the way he'd been at twenty, before the station ground him down.

But he could breathe. Could move. Could be present for his kids and his community. Could use the years of knowledge in his scarred hands and damaged back to teach the next generation how to fight.

The money had given him that. Or maybe it had just cleared away enough pain for him to remember he'd always had something to offer beyond his labor.

Seven months in, Marcus stood in the common area and watched Aisha debate corporate policy in a practice session, watched David code instructions for his robot, watched Yuki draw and Chen organize a community meal and Sarah teach meditation.

Watched people transform when given the simple gift of security.

He thought about whoever was sending the money. Thought about what kind of person saw this broken system and decided to just... act. To prove something. To show that people could thrive if given the chance.

"I don't know who you are," Marcus said quietly to no one, to the anonymous benefactor, to the universe. "But in my experience, the measure of a person is what they do when no one's watching. When there's no credit, no recognition, no reward."

Around him, his community breathed. Together. Alive in ways they hadn't been allowed to be.

"So thank you," Marcus said. "For letting us breathe."

And then he went to pick up his kids from tutoring, walking steady on legs that didn't hurt, full of something he'd almost forgotten the shape of.

Hope.
