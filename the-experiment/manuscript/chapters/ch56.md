# Chapter 56: Final Project

Reed had maybe twelve hours of lucidity left. Amara had the camera ready.

"You don't have to do this now," she said gently. "We could wait until—"

"Until what? Until I'm dead?" Reed smiled. It hurt. Everything hurt. "No. Now. While I can still think clearly enough to explain."

The camera was professional-grade, borrowed from an independent journalist who'd been covering the labor movement. High resolution. Good audio. This would be the record—Reed's own words explaining the experiment, the data, the meaning.

His final project.

Amara positioned the camera. Reed sat in his apartment, Sector 12 visible through the window behind him. He looked exactly like what he was: a thirty-seven-year-old man dying of kidney failure, too broke to afford treatment, spending his last conscious hours explaining why it mattered.

"Ready?" Amara asked.

"No. Start anyway."

The red light appeared. Recording.

Reed looked at the camera and began.

---

"My name is Reed Salazar. I'm thirty-seven years old. I'm dying of kidney failure caused by Leveler poisoning, which I needed because I couldn't afford to process anxiety and poverty any other way. In about twelve hours, I'll lose lucidity completely. In two or three days, I'll be dead. This is my accounting."

He paused. Breathed. Continued.

"Five years ago, I found five hundred million credits in corporate black operations funding. I stole it. That's not metaphor or gray area—I stole corporate money that was meant for things corporations don't want documented. And then I gave it away to people in Sector 12 as Universal Basic Income. Two thousand credits per month, no strings attached, to see what would happen when people didn't have to work to survive."

Reed's hands shook. He pressed them against his knees.

"Corporate-speak would call this an 'unfortunate resource misappropriation' or an 'unlawful economic intervention.' I call it the best decision of my life." He looked directly at the camera. "And here's what happened."

He pulled up the data on a screen visible in frame. Five years of meticulous documentation.

"Crime in Sector 12 dropped seventy-one percent. Not because we hired more security. Because people weren't desperate anymore. Emergency medical calls dropped seventy-six percent. Because people could afford preventive care and rest before their bodies failed. Educational enrollment increased four hundred twelve percent. Because when you're not working three jobs, you can learn."

Reed cycled through graphs, charts, testimonials.

"Community organization increased four hundred thirty-two percent. Because when you have time to think, you remember you're human and so are your neighbors. Cooperative businesses went from zero to one hundred seventy-three station-wide. Because people wanted to work—they just wanted to own their labor instead of being owned by it."

He let the data stand. Then continued.

"Executive Director Jonathan Harris told me this experiment would make people lazy. That without the coercion of poverty, humans become dependent and unproductive. He was wrong. He was catastrophically, measurably, completely wrong. And I have five years of data proving it."

Reed's voice was getting weaker. He pushed through.

"But here's what the data doesn't show. What you can't measure in crime statistics or health metrics." He looked at the window, at Sector 12. "People smiled. Real smiles, not the mandatory corporate optimism. Kids played instead of working to help family income. A woman named Yuki Tanaka discovered they're a brilliant artist because they finally had time to try. Marcus Ibrahim, who corporate ground down for forty years, taught a new generation how to organize and fight back."

"Those aren't statistics. Those are lives. Real human lives that corporate metrics call 'pre-prosperous' and 'opportunities for growth' and 'early resource reallocation.' Translation: poor. Exploited. Dead before their time."

Reed's hands shook harder. He didn't try to hide it.

"My brother Marco died at twenty-five. Three jobs, medical debt, body failed from overwork. Corporate called it 'early resource reallocation.' I call it murder by poverty. And for five years, I've been trying to prove that Marco didn't have to die. That the system isn't inevitable. That people deserve better just because they're people."

He paused. Breathed.

"I proved it. Sector 12 thrived. Workers across seventeen sectors organized for dignity. Cooperative businesses replaced extractive employment. And when my money ran out—when the UBI ended after sixty-three months—nothing collapsed. Because the experiment was never about the money. It was about buying people time to remember they're human beings, not productivity metrics."

Reed looked directly at the camera.

"Corporate will try to bury this. They'll say I was a thief and a fraud who enabled dependency. They'll use my death as proof that UBI doesn't work. They'll twist every stat and manipulate every outcome to protect their power." He smiled. "Let them try. The data exists. The cooperatives exist. The one hundred seventy-three worker-owned businesses exist. The seventeen sectors of organized labor exist. You can't bury reality forever."

His voice was fading. Minutes of lucidity left. He needed to finish.

"If you're watching this, you're probably from a lower sector. You probably work multiple jobs. You probably can't afford to be sick. You probably buy corporate propaganda that you're poor because you're lazy or unlucky or didn't try hard enough."

"Listen to me: It's a lie. The system is designed to grind you into paste and call it opportunity. You're not failing capitalism. Capitalism is failing you. And what happened in Sector 12 proves there's another way."

Reed leaned forward, using his last energy.

"I'm dying because I refused corporate's offer to buy my silence with new kidneys and forty years of comfortable complicity. I chose to die proving people deserve better. And I'd make that choice again. Every time. Because some things matter more than survival."

"Marco mattered. Yuki matters. Marcus matters. Every single person ground down by this system matters. And you matter. Remember that. You deserve to breathe. To rest. To play. To make art. To organize. To demand better. Not because you're productive, but because you're human."

He was fading. Needed to finish.

"The experiment is over. The UBI ended. I'm dying. But what we proved lives on in every cooperative business, every labor union, every person who remembers they deserve dignity." Reed smiled one last time. "Corporate thought they could destroy us. They failed. Because you can't kill an idea whose time has come."

"My name was Reed Salazar. I stole five hundred million credits and gave them away. I proved the system wrong. I died at thirty-seven having chosen truth over survival. And I'd do it all again."

"Remember Sector 12. Remember what's possible. And when corporate tells you there's no alternative, remember this: for sixty-three months, three hundred forty-seven people lived proof that they're lying."

"Now go build your own alternative. Together."

Reed looked at Amara. "Stop recording."

The red light disappeared.

---

Amara was crying. Reed could barely focus anymore—his body was shutting down, lucidity fragmenting.

"That was perfect," she said. "Reed, that was everything we needed."

"Good. Back it up. Multiple locations. Corporate can't suppress it all."

"Already done. Encrypted networks, independent journalists, worker organizations, academic archives. When you..." She stopped. "When the time comes, this releases automatically."

"Thank you." Reed's eyes were closing. "For everything. For documenting. For believing. For making sure the truth survives."

"Reed—"

"Tell Marcus to keep teaching. Tell Yuki to keep making art. Tell Harris he was wrong and I proved it." Reed smiled. "And tell my brother I made his death mean something."

"I will. I promise."

Reed's consciousness was slipping. Hours left. Maybe less.

But the video existed. Encrypted, backed up, ready to release.

His final project was complete.

The truth would outlive him.

That was enough.
