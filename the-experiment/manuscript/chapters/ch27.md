# Chapter 27: False Flag

The fire started at 2:47 AM in Yuki's art studio.

Reed was awake—he was always awake at 2:47 AM these days—when the emergency alerts lit up his terminal. Building 4, Section C, Sector 12. Structural fire. Multiple casualties reported.

He had the security footage pulled up in seventeen seconds.

Three figures in Sector 12 resident clothing. Faces obscured by maintenance hoods that nobody in Sector 12 had worn in two years because nobody worked maintenance shifts at 2 AM anymore. Moving with precision that spoke of training, not poverty. Molotov cocktails through the studio windows—professional grade accelerant, not the amateur hour stuff Reed remembered from his dealer days.

And cameras. The agitators had cameras.

Reed's hands were shaking again. He reached for the Leveler, took his dose, waited for the chemical steadiness to kick in. Watched the studio burn on three different angles of surveillance.

By 3:15 AM, the fire was contained. By 3:30 AM, station emergency services had pulled two people out with smoke inhalation—neither of them Yuki, thank Christ, because Yuki hadn't been sleeping in the studio since their partner moved in six months ago.

By 4:00 AM, the corporate news feeds went live.

**SECTOR 12 "PARADISE" DESCENDS INTO CHAOS**
*Violence erupts as UBI recipients turn on each other*

**"THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN PEOPLE DON'T WORK": Director Harris responds to overnight destruction**

**EXCLUSIVE FOOTAGE: Inside Sector 12's night of rage**

Reed watched the coverage with something beyond anger. The footage was professional. Edited. The arsonists were cropped out of every frame, replaced with shaky cam shots of panicked residents fleeing the fire. The narrative was already written: lazy UBI recipients, bored without work, turning to violence and destruction.

Not a word about the three professionals with corporate-grade accelerant.

His encrypted terminal chimed. Amara, awake like everyone else in Sector 12.

*A: Please tell me you're seeing this.*

*R: Every goddamn second of it.*

*A: They're not even hiding it. Those weren't residents. I've been documenting this community for three years—nobody moves like that, nobody has access to that kind of accelerant.*

*R: Corporate doesn't care. They have their narrative.*

*A: We have to counter it. The truth—*

*R: The truth costs money.*

Reed pulled up his financial projections. Station media buys. Counter-narrative campaigns. Security upgrades for every community space in Sector 12 before corporate sent more agitators. Legal defense funds for when corporate inevitably blamed actual residents for the fire.

Conservative estimate: 2.4 million credits.

Twelve months of operating funds gone in one night.

He was going to do it anyway.

*R: I'm buying counter-media time. Can you compile the real footage?*

*A: Already done. But Reed, if you do this, they'll know someone's funding resistance. They'll intensify tracking.*

*R: They already know. This is just making it official.*

By 8:00 AM, Sector 12's community council had assembled in Marcus Ibrahim's apartment—the studio was ash, and nobody was pretending it was an accident.

Reed attended via encrypted audio only. Amara was there in person, her recorder running, documenting everything.

"Three trained operatives," Marcus was saying, his voice rough with smoke he'd inhaled helping with evacuation. "Corporate tactical gear under resident clothes. I worked station security for five years before they automated my job—I know what corp-trained movement looks like."

"The media's already calling it our fault," Yuki said. Reed could hear the shake in their voice, the old anxiety creeping back. "They're saying we burned my studio because I had success and we can't handle other people achieving things."

"That's absurd," Amara said. "Your studio was community-funded. Your success is everyone's success. That's the whole point."

"Corporate doesn't care about points," Reed said through the encrypted speaker. Everyone in the room went quiet when the benefactor's distorted voice came through. "They care about narrative. And right now they're winning."

"So what do we do?" someone asked—Shen, who ran the community childcare cooperative.

Reed took a breath. "We buy truth. I've allocated funds for station-wide media buys. Dr. Osei has footage showing what really happened. We flood every channel with reality until corporate can't spin it anymore."

"How much will that cost?" Marcus asked.

"More than we can afford. Less than the cost of letting them win."

Silence. Reed listened to seventeen people breathing in a room that used to be impossible—workers with time to assemble at 8 AM on a Wednesday because they didn't have to work three jobs to survive.

"There's something else," Amara said quietly. "The accelerant they used? I sent a sample to a contact in station forensics. It's corporate security-grade. Not available on any market, black or otherwise. Whoever did this had authorization from the Board."

More silence. Heavier this time.

"They tried to kill us," Yuki said.

"They tried to kill the idea of us," Reed corrected. "They failed."

---

By noon, Reed had purchased media time on every independent station channel and half the corporate ones. You could buy anything on Nova Prosperity if you had enough credits. Even truth.

The counter-narrative went live at 1:00 PM:

**SECTOR 12 FIRE: Corporate Agitators Caught on Camera**
*Independent analysis shows professional operatives, not residents, behind destruction*

**FORENSIC EVIDENCE: Arson accelerant traced to corporate security suppliers**
*"This was a targeted attack," says community spokesperson*

**DR. AMARA OSEI: "They're trying to destroy what they can't control"**
*Researcher's analysis of false flag operation*

The response was immediate.

By 2:00 PM, corporate had pulled their earlier stories and replaced them with new ones:

**SECTOR 12 SPREADS "CONSPIRACY THEORIES" ABOUT TRAGIC ACCIDENT**
*"Desperate attempt to avoid accountability," says Director Harris*

**EXPERT ANALYSIS: Why UBI recipients turn to paranoid thinking**

**THE PSYCHOLOGY OF VICTIMHOOD: When handouts replace personal responsibility**

Reed watched the narrative war unfold across seventeen screens. Corporate had unlimited resources. He had twelve months of funding left. Maybe ten now.

They could outspend him until he ran dry.

But they couldn't outrun the truth.

His terminal chimed with incoming messages from across the station. Other sectors. Workers who'd been watching Sector 12 for three years, waiting to see if the transformation was real or corporate theater.

*From Sector 8: We see what they did. We believe you.*

*From Sector 15: Our organizers are compiling similar incidents. Corporate's been doing this everywhere there's resistance.*

*From Sector 23: Tell us how to fight back. We're ready.*

Reed read the messages three times. Other sectors were organizing not because they had UBI, but because they'd watched corporate try to burn down the alternative.

Amara messaged privately: *You're going broke buying truth.*

*R: Worth it.*

*A: Is it? If you run out of money in ten months instead of twelve, what changes?*

*R: Everything. Nothing. I don't know anymore.*

*A: Reed. I need you to see something.*

A file appeared. Video footage, timestamped 3:17 AM. Sector 12, Building 4. The studio still burning. And there, in the foreground: residents forming a water brigade with building supplies, fighting the fire before emergency services arrived. Marcus organizing triage. Yuki, ash-covered and terrified, checking on neighbors instead of mourning the studio.

Community happening in real-time.

*A: This is what corporate tried to burn. Not Yuki's art. Not a building. This. People remembering how to care for each other.*

*A: You can't buy this. You could never buy this. The money was just the spark.*

Reed watched the footage. Sector 12 residents risking themselves for each other. No profit motive. No corporate optimization. Just humans being human.

His brother Marco had died alone in a corporate medical facility, unable to afford the company of anyone who gave a shit.

This was different.

*R: We're rebuilding the studio. Community fund matching, whatever people can contribute. If I have to spend another million credits on security to keep it safe, I will.*

*A: You're going to run out of money.*

*R: Probably.*

*A: And then what?*

*R: Then we figure out if what we built can survive without me.*

By evening, the narrative had fractured across the station. Corporate channels insisted the fire was an accident or internal Sector 12 violence. Independent channels showed the footage of corporate agitators. Worker forums debated the implications.

And in Sector 12, the community council approved plans to rebuild Yuki's studio using collective funds and volunteer labor.

Reed transferred 1.2 million credits to Sector 12's community account for security upgrades. His remaining balance dropped to 7.8 million.

Ten months of funding. Maybe eight if corporate escalated again.

He should be terrified. Should be planning exit strategies, preparing for inevitable failure.

Instead, he felt something like peace.

The money would run out. Corporate would win the war of resources. But Sector 12 had learned something more valuable than credits: they'd learned to build things together.

You couldn't burn that down with corporate-grade accelerant.

You couldn't spin it away with media narratives.

You could only watch it spread.

His terminal showed new messages from Sectors 8, 15, 23, 30, 42. Workers organizing, inspired not by UBI but by watching a community refuse to be destroyed.

Reed laughed. The sound was dark and tired and maybe a little bit hopeful.

Corporate had just spent enormous resources trying to prove UBI made people violent and lazy.

Instead, they'd proven that when you attacked a community, it came together stronger.

Director Harris was going to hate the next quarter's data.

At midnight, Reed received an encrypted message from an unknown source. His security protocols flagged it as high risk—sophisticated routing that suggested corporate black ops.

He opened it anyway. He was too tired to be careful anymore.

**MESSAGE: We know who you are, Mr. Salazar. We know what you've done. And we're prepared to make you an offer you'll want to hear. Soon.**

**Director Harris sends his regards.**

Reed stared at the message. They had him. Not just suspicion anymore—they had evidence, proof, his actual name in their systems.

He should run. Should implement emergency protocols. Should disappear before they came for him.

Instead, he forwarded the message to Amara with a single line:

*The clock just got faster.*

Then he transferred next month's UBI payments early—just in case he wasn't around to send them on schedule.

In Sector 12, the community worked through the night rebuilding what corporate had tried to destroy.

Ten months of funding left. Maybe less.

Reed watched them build and wondered if ten months was enough time to teach a revolution to survive without him.
