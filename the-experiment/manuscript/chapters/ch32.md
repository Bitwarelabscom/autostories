# Chapter 32: Strikes Begin

The station-wide labor coordination happened on a Tuesday, which Reed found darkly appropriate. Revolutions should happen on the most boring day of the week.

He watched it unfold across every feed at once: seventeen sectors, forty-three thousand workers, all of them walking off their shifts at exactly 0900 hours.

Not asking for UBI.

Asking for everything else.

Reed's terminal displayed the joint statement from the Nova Prosperity Workers' Coordinating Council—an organization that hadn't existed six months ago and now represented a third of the station's labor force:

**WE DEMAND:**
- Living wages without requiring multiple jobs
- Healthcare not contingent on employment status
- Elimination of sector-based service discrimination
- Worker representation on the Station Board
- End to prosperity score employment discrimination
- Safe working conditions with real enforcement
- Abolition of mandatory debt for basic services

**WE WILL STRIKE UNTIL THESE DEMANDS ARE MET.**

Not a word about UBI. Not a mention of anonymous benefactors or Sector 12's experiment.

They'd moved beyond him.

Reed should have been relieved. Instead, he felt something uncomfortably close to grief.

"You're watching," Amara said through their encrypted channel. She was embedded with the Sector 15 strike coordination, documenting everything. "What do you think?"

*R: I think I'm obsolete.*

*A: You're not obsolete. You're just not the story anymore.*

*R: Same thing.*

*A: Reed. Look at what's happening. This isn't about you. It never was.*

Reed looked. Sector 8's waste processing workers had formed a picket line at the main facility, using the old union songs Marcus had taught them. Sector 15's food service workers had walked out simultaneously, leaving executive dining halls empty for the first time in station history. Sector 23's maintenance crews had cordoned off the corporate transit hubs.

Forty-three thousand workers who'd never received a credit of UBI, organizing on principles they'd learned from watching Sector 12.

His terminal chimed with financial updates. The strike was already costing corporate millions in lost productivity. Emergency Board meetings. Threat matrices. Security assessments.

And Reed's remaining balance: 4.2 million credits. Five months of Sector 12 payments left, maybe six if he stopped spending on security and counter-propaganda.

The revolution was happening without his money.

Part of him wanted to laugh. Part of him wanted to cry. He settled for taking another dose of Leveler and watching history happen in real-time.

By noon, the corporate response came through every official channel:

**BOARD STATEMENT: Coordinated work abandonment will result in immediate termination and credit freeze for all participants. This illegal action threatens station safety and prosperity. Return to work within 24 hours or face permanent employment blacklisting.**

**Director Harris: "We're disappointed by this small group of agitators who fail to understand that their actions hurt everyone, including themselves."**

Forty-three thousand workers was not a small group.

Reed pulled up the station infrastructure monitors—illegal access, but corporate had bigger problems than his hacking right now. Life support systems were holding steady. Food production was down 40% but reserves would last weeks. Waste processing had slowed but wasn't critical yet.

The station could survive this.

Corporate's power couldn't.

His encrypted channel lit up. Amara again, but this time with video. She'd embedded herself in the Sector 15 strike headquarters—a converted warehouse where hundreds of workers were coordinating in real-time.

"I'm sending you something," she said. "You need to see this."

The video showed a planning session. Workers from different sectors sharing strategies, organizing childcare coverage so strikers with kids could participate, setting up mutual aid networks for food and medical care during the strike.

And then Reed saw him: Marcus Ibrahim, standing at the front of the room, teaching collective bargaining strategies he remembered from the old union days before corporate crushed organized labor.

"The key is solidarity," Marcus was saying. "They want us to compete with each other—Sector 8 against 15 against 23. They want us to think the problem is each other, not them. But what did Sector 12 prove?"

Someone in the crowd shouted: "That we deserve to live!"

"Damn right," Marcus said. "And we don't need a mysterious benefactor to prove that. We just need each other."

The crowd erupted in agreement. Reed watched Marcus—the man who'd been so broken by labor that walking hurt—leading a room of workers who'd never received UBI but had learned what solidarity looked like from watching Sector 12 thrive.

Amara's voice came through: "You see it now?"

*R: See what?*

*A: You didn't give them UBI. You gave them a mirror. You showed them what they could be if they weren't ground down to nothing. The money was just the space to breathe.*

*R: And now they're creating that space themselves.*

*A: Exactly.*

Reed closed his eyes. His hands were shaking—not from Leveler, for once, but from something that felt dangerously like hope.

The money would run out in five months. Sector 12's UBI would end. And it wouldn't matter, because the idea had already spread beyond what credits could buy.

By evening, the Board issued a revised statement:

**EMERGENCY NEGOTIATION: The Board invites worker representatives to discuss concerns in good faith. While we cannot accept illegal demands made under duress, we recognize the importance of dialogue in maintaining station prosperity.**

Translation: they were scared.

Reed had spent three years and 496 million credits trying to prove the system was broken. Forty-three thousand workers with no UBI had done it in one day by refusing to participate.

His terminal showed messages flooding in from across the strike:

*Sector 8: Holding strong. No one's breaking.*

*Sector 15: Corporate tried to bring in replacement workers. Sector 23 maintenance blocked their transit. Solidarity.*

*Sector 30: We're not even officially striking but we're organizing support. Food deliveries to picket lines.*

*Sector 42: Our prosperity scores are tanking but we don't care anymore. They can't fire all of us.*

Reed read them all. Workers discovering their own power, not because someone gave them money but because they'd seen an alternative and decided to fight for it.

Amara messaged privately: *Your funds?*

*R: Five months.*

*A: And after that?*

*R: After that, Sector 12 figures out how to sustain without me. Just like everyone else.*

*A: You sound okay with that.*

*R: I'm terrified and exhausted and probably dying from Leveler poisoning. But yeah. I'm okay with it.*

*A: Good. Because I need you to come to Sector 15 tomorrow.*

*R: Why?*

*A: The coordinating council wants to meet the person who started this.*

*R: I didn't start this. They did.*

*A: Tell them that yourself. In person. Reed, you've been hiding for four years. It's time to let them see you.*

Reed looked at his reflection in the dark terminal screen. Thirty-five years old—no, wait, he'd had a birthday last month, he was thirty-six now. Latino kid from Sector 12 who'd dealt drugs and stolen corporate money and accidentally proved the system could be different.

He looked sick. Thin. Tired.

But he looked like someone who'd done something that mattered.

*R: Okay.*

*A: Okay?*

*R: I'll come. Tomorrow. Let them see the disappointing reality behind the myth.*

*A: Reed. You're not disappointing. You're human. That's better.*

The connection closed. Reed sat in his apartment, listening to the sounds of Sector 12 outside. Quieter than usual—a lot of residents had gone to support the strikes in other sectors. Community organizing across sector lines, something that would have been impossible four years ago.

His terminal showed the remaining balance: 4,200,000 credits.

Five months until zero.

Forty-three thousand workers proving that zero didn't matter anymore.

Reed stood up. Looked out his window at Sector 12. The mural on Building 4 had been repainted after the fire—bigger now, showing hands from different sectors reaching toward each other. Someone had added new text: "We Are All Sector 12."

Tomorrow he'd go to Sector 15. Let the coordinating council see that their benefactor was just a burned-out dealer with shaky hands and a Leveler habit who'd made one impulsive choice that cascaded beyond anything he'd imagined.

Tonight, he'd watch the station learn what Sector 12 had known for three years:

People didn't need to be ground into paste to be productive.

They just needed to remember they were human.

---

At midnight, Reed sent the monthly payments to Sector 12's accounts. Maybe forty more transfers left. Maybe thirty if corporate escalated.

Didn't matter.

The revolution had learned to finance itself.

His terminal chimed with a priority message. Corporate signature. Not Harris—someone higher.

**SUBJECT: Final Offer Forthcoming**
**You've made your point, Mr. Salazar. Now let's discuss terms before this gets worse for everyone. We can give you what you need. Think about it.**

Reed laughed. The sound echoed in his empty apartment.

Corporate thought this was still about him. Thought they could buy him off or threaten him into compliance.

They had no idea they were already too late.

The strikes would continue with or without Reed Salazar.

Sector 12 would sustain itself beyond his money.

The movement had transcended its catalyst.

He typed back a single word: **No.**

Then he went to bed for the first time in three days, and dreamed of his brother Marco watching forty-three thousand workers demand the dignity Marco had never lived to see.
