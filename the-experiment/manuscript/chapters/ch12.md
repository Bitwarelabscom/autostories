# Chapter 12: Reed Watches

Reed Salazar had been watching people for thirty years, but it was only in the last seven months that he'd started seeing them.

There was a difference. Watching was what you did to survive—tracking who was desperate, who might cause problems, who could afford product. Watching was transactional. Clinical. The emotional distance of someone who'd accepted that people were just variables in the equation of getting through another day.

Seeing was different. Seeing was dangerous.

Reed sat in his usual corner of Building 7's common area—the spot with sightlines to all entrances and exits, old dealer habits—with his battered tablet and three months of detailed notes. He was supposed to be here to sell Leveler. That was his cover. That was his life.

But sales were down forty-three percent and falling, and Reed was spending more time documenting than dealing.

He watched Chen teach a group of kids how to play an ancient card game. Chen who'd worked three jobs and laughed like a man who'd seen too much, now patient and present with children who actually looked at him like he mattered. Making up rules when he forgot them, the kids laughing, nobody in any hurry to be anywhere else.

Reed made a note: *Month 7, Day 12: Chen engaging in voluntary mentorship activity. Visible reduction in stress markers—posture relaxed, affect appropriate. Kids responding positively to adult attention. Query: when did we stop having time for children?*

His tablet was full of queries like that. Questions he'd never thought to ask when he was just watching. Questions that only emerged when you started seeing.

Yuki arrived, paint-stained and energized in a way that Reed still found startling. Seven months ago Yuki had been vibrating panic, three jobs and pharmaceutical management and constant apologies. Now they moved through the common area with purpose, setting up an easel near the window where the light was best.

"Sorry, is this okay?" Yuki asked reflexively, then caught themselves. "I mean—actually, you know what, I'm not sorry. This is good light. I'm painting here."

Reed smiled despite himself. Watched Yuki not-apologize, claim space, exist without justification.

He made a note: *Yuki self-advocacy improvement. Reduction in performative apology. Confidence in artistic identity. Seven months from worker-unit to artist. Subject demonstrates clear correlation between economic security and self-actualization.*

The academic language felt wrong in his head, but Reed had been reading sociology papers at 3 AM, trying to understand what he was seeing. Trying to put frameworks to the transformation. Trying to prove—to who? to Marco's memory?—that this meant something.

Marcus came in with his kids. Both of them in school uniforms, the boy chattering excitedly about robotics club, the girl quieter but confident in the way teenagers got when they'd figured something out. Marcus looked tired but present. Pain managed. Able to be a father instead of just a survival machine.

Reed tracked the interaction. The way Marcus listened instead of just waiting for them to stop talking. The way the kids treated education like opportunity instead of obligation. The way the daughter mentioned her debate team ranking without apology, without the self-deprecation poverty taught you.

Note: *Generational impact visible. Marcus's children demonstrating different relationship to achievement and future. Prosperity score inheritance pattern potentially disrupted. If sustained...*

He trailed off. If sustained. Everything was if sustained. If corporate didn't crush it. If the money didn't run out. If Reed didn't get caught.

If, if, if.

Reed pulled out his Leveler kit from habit, then looked at it. The little white pills that had been his constant for eight years. His pain management and emotional buffer and chemical distance from caring about anything.

He still used. Still needed it to get through days that felt too real, too full of possibility and danger. But the quality was different now. Before, Leveler had been escape—the only way to endure the grinding pointlessness of existing in a system designed to extract everything and give nothing back.

Now it was... what? Maintenance? A familiar ritual? The last thread connecting him to the person he'd been before he decided to burn half a billion credits proving a point?

Reed took one. Dry-swallowed it. Watched it not really change anything except the edges of his anxiety.

"You doing okay?"

Marcus, suddenly there. Reed's awareness must be slipping if Marcus could sneak up on him. Or maybe Reed was just tired. He was always tired, but lately it was a different tired. Not the exhausted despair of pointlessness but the exhaustion of carrying something heavy that mattered.

"Fine," Reed said. Then, because lying to Marcus felt stupid: "Watching. Documenting."

Marcus sat down uninvited. Looked at Reed's tablet, the dense notes, the careful observations. "You're running the experiment."

It wasn't a question.

Reed should deny it. Should deflect. Should protect his anonymity because that was the only thing keeping him safe from corporate investigation and board retaliation and—

"Yeah," he said. Laughed inappropriately, sharp and bitter. "Yeah, I'm running it. Found money that wasn't mine, couldn't spend it on myself without getting tracked, thought... I don't know. Thought I'd see what happened if people just. Didn't have to."

"Didn't have to what?"

"Anything. Everything. Starve or work terrible jobs. Choose between food and medicine. Grind themselves down for prosperity scores that never actually improve anything."

Marcus nodded slowly. "In my experience, the people who see the system clearest are the ones it's hurt the worst."

"It killed my brother," Reed said flatly. "Marco. He was twenty-five. Worked three jobs trying to pay off medical debt from when he got sick. Couldn't afford treatment until it was too late, then couldn't afford the treatment they gave him. Died owing the hospital 47,000 credits. They called it 'early resource reallocation' in the report. Like he'd just been inefficiently distributed."

The words came out toneless, deadpan. Reed had told this story in his head a thousand times but never out loud. Hearing it spoken made it real in a way that hurt differently than the constant background ache.

"I'm sorry," Marcus said.

"Everyone was sorry. Didn't change anything. Corporate sent a grief counselor—twenty-minute session, billed to his account, added to his debt. The debt I inherited because we were listed as family. So I got his death and his bills and a pamphlet about 'transforming tragedy into prosperity motivation.'"

Reed laughed again. The inappropriate kind, the kind that was grief pretending to be humor. "I paid it off over six years. Every credit. And the whole time I thought, this is what his life was worth. 47,000 credits and a twenty-minute counseling session."

Marcus was quiet. Then: "Is that what this is? Paying back his death?"

"I don't know what this is." Reed gestured at the common area, at Yuki painting and Chen teaching and all the small transformations happening. "I found the money and I was high and I thought... what if people just didn't have to? What if the system is wrong and I could prove it?"

"You're proving it," Marcus said.

"Or I'm buying people happiness that'll disappear when the money runs out. Or corporate crushes the experiment. Or they find me and..." Reed trailed off. Didn't finish the thought.

"You know they're looking."

"Harris basically addressed me personally on CMN. 'Stop, you're hurting people.' Yeah. I'm hurting people by letting them sleep and eat and discover they're more than productivity metrics."

"He believes it," Marcus said. "That's the thing about people like Harris. They genuinely think work-or-starve is dignity. They can't imagine another way because they've never had to."

Reed pulled up his documentation. Showed Marcus the notes. The statistical tracking. The individual observations and the aggregate patterns and the careful, academic analysis of what happened when you removed the gun of starvation from people's heads.

"I'm writing it all down," Reed said. "Everything. If they shut this down, if they bury it, I want there to be a record. Want someone to be able to say: we tried this. It worked. They lied about it working, but here's the data."

Marcus scrolled through the notes. Weeks of observation. Hundreds of data points. The transformation documented with scientific precision and occasional bursts of emotion that Reed had tried to delete but couldn't quite.

*Why do we accept that existence has to be earned? That baseline survival requires justification?*

*Chen slept through the night. Cried when he told me. Thirty-eight years old and sleeping through the night made him cry.*

*Yuki's painting of Building 7 is beautiful. They've lived here six years and never saw it as beautiful until they had time to look.*

*If Marco had just had money. Just had time. Just had security. Would he still—*

The last entry cut off. Reed had written it at 4 AM two weeks ago, high and grieving and unable to finish the thought because finishing it meant acknowledging that his brother died for nothing. Died because the system needed his labor and his debt more than it needed him alive.

"This is good work," Marcus said quietly. "Real documentation. The kind that matters."

"It won't matter if corporate buries it."

"So we make sure they can't." Marcus looked at Reed directly. "You're not alone in this. You know that, right? You started it, but the community—we're living it. We can testify. We can fight back when they try to erase us."

Reed wanted to believe that. Wanted to think that collective action could stand against corporate power and algorithmic narrative control and the entire weight of a system designed to crush anything that threatened profit.

But he'd watched that system kill Marco. Watched it grind down everyone he'd ever known. Watched it present exploitation as opportunity for thirty years.

"I don't know if it's enough," he said.

"It never feels like enough when you're the one doing it," Marcus said. "But you've given eighty-three people a chance to breathe. To become themselves. That's not nothing."

Eighty-three people in Building 7. Reed's entire world reduced to one building, one sector, one small experiment in a station of five million souls. It was absurd. Insignificant. A rounding error in the grand machinery of exploitation.

And it was also everything.

Reed watched Yuki paint. Watched Chen teach. Watched Marcus's kids do homework with a focus that came from believing it might actually matter. Watched the community that had formed in seven months—book clubs and art classes and child care cooperatives and the spontaneous mutual aid that emerged when people had capacity for something beyond survival.

He made another note: *Month 7, Day 12: Community formation accelerating. Mutual aid structures emerging organically. No top-down organization required—people naturally cooperate when not forced to compete for survival resources. Query: what if competition isn't human nature, just scarcity behavior? Query: what if most of what we think is human nature is just trauma response to systems designed to hurt us?*

Academic language failing to contain the weight of what he was seeing.

Reed closed the tablet. Looked at Marcus. "If they find me—"

"They won't."

"But if they do. The data needs to survive. The real story. Not their propaganda about laziness and entitlement, but what actually happened."

"I'll make sure," Marcus said. "We'll make sure. The whole community."

Reed nodded. Felt something unfamiliar in his chest. Not hope exactly—he was too damaged for hope—but maybe purpose. Maybe the sense that his life was adding up to something other than just time served between birth and death.

He thought about Marco. Twenty-five years old, dead from a system that valued his debt more than his life. Thought about all the ways he'd tried to make that death mean something. Paying off the bills. Surviving out of spite. Selling Leveler to people as desperate as he was.

And now this. This weird, impossible experiment that was maybe, possibly, proving that Marco didn't have to die. That none of them had to live like this. That the system was a choice, not a law of nature, and choices could be changed.

"You should rest," Marcus said. "You look exhausted."

Reed laughed. "I've looked exhausted for ten years."

"Yeah, but now you're exhausted for a reason."

That was true. Reed was exhausted from documenting transformations and managing transfers and staying ahead of corporate investigations and existing in a state of constant low-level terror that they'd find him and it would all collapse.

But he was also alive in a way he hadn't been since Marco died. Since before that, maybe. Since he'd first accepted that survival was the only victory worth pursuing and everything else was dangerous fantasy.

He was alive and he was watching people bloom and he was maybe, possibly doing something that mattered.

Even if it all ended tomorrow. Even if Harris found him and corporate crushed Sector 12 and the experiment became nothing but a cautionary tale in business school ethics classes.

Reed had seen it work.

Had documented people thriving when given the simple gift of security. Had recorded proof that the corporate narrative—people are lazy, work creates meaning, prosperity must be earned—was a lie designed to justify exploitation.

And that was something.

That was enough.

For now.

---

That night, Reed sat in his pod apartment—barely bigger than a closet, everything he owned fitting in two bags—and continued his documentation.

He wrote about Yuki's transformation from three-job anxiety to confident artist. About Marcus's pain management and parenting. About Chen sleeping through the night. About Sarah Kim teaching meditation. About Liu running art classes. About the community garden and the book club and the child care cooperative and all the small, beautiful ways humans took care of each other when they had the capacity.

He wrote about the corporate hit pieces and the propaganda and the weaponized language. About Harris speaking directly to him through the camera, asking him to stop, genuinely believing that forcing people into terrible jobs was dignity.

He wrote about his brother Marco, who died at twenty-five, and how this whole thing was maybe just Reed trying to prove that death wasn't inevitable. Wasn't necessary. Was just one possible outcome of a system that could have been different.

The Leveler was wearing off. Reed's hands shook slightly as he typed. His head hurt. The depression that was his baseline started creeping back in at the edges.

He took another pill. Watched the shaking stop. Kept writing.

*Month 7, Day 12, 23:47: Personal observation. I'm still using. Still dependent. Still probably dying slowly from years of poverty and self-medication and accumulated damage. The experiment hasn't saved me. But watching it save other people is... something. A reason. First one I've had since Marco.*

*Corporate will probably find me. Probably soon. Harris said they have theories. Financial forensics. I'm running out of time.*

*But if I can get another few months. If I can document enough data. If I can prove it worked long enough that the lie can't completely bury the truth...*

*That might be enough.*

*That might be what living for something looks like.*

Reed saved the file. Encrypted it. Backed it up to three separate hidden servers. Set it to auto-release to specific addresses if he went offline for more than thirty days.

Insurance. Legacy. Evidence.

Then he laid down in his sleeping pod and stared at the ceiling and thought about his brother, dead at twenty-five, and himself at thirty, running an experiment that might get him killed but at least meant something.

At least proved the system was wrong.

At least showed, for seven months in one building in one sector, that people could be happy.

Could be human.

Could bloom.

And Reed, who hadn't believed in anything for a decade, found himself believing in that.

Found himself willing to die for it, if it came to that.

Because some data was worth the cost.

Some truths needed to be documented, no matter what.

Reed closed his eyes. Thought: *Marco. I'm trying. I'm trying to prove it didn't have to be that way.*

And then, finally, slept.
