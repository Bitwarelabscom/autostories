# Chapter 19: Preliminary Findings

The Interstation Economics Conference was held on Sector 3, in the gleaming academic district where universities had satellite campuses and corporate funding bought buildings with names like "Prosperity Collective Center for Economic Research." Everything was polished glass and efficient design. Everything spoke of legitimacy and authority and the weight of serious scholarship.

Dr. Amara Osei stood backstage, watching the previous presenter through a monitor, and tried to keep her hands from shaking.

In twenty minutes, she would walk onto that stage and present research that contradicted every economic assumption the people in that auditorium believed. Would show data proving that universal basic income didn't create laziness or dependency or moral decay.

Would end her career.

Her tablet buzzed. Message from Reed: *You don't have to do this. The data can leak other ways. You can protect yourself.*

Amara typed back: *I'm doing it. Someone has to say it out loud.*

*You're braver than I am,* Reed wrote.

*You started all of this,* Amara responded. *With everything to lose. I'm just finishing it.*

The previous presenter wrapped up. Polite applause. An academic discussion of labor market optimization that assumed work-or-starve was natural law.

The conference moderator stepped to the microphone. "Our next presentation is from Dr. Amara Osei of Nova Station University. Dr. Osei has been conducting field research in Sector 12 examining an unusual economic phenomenon. Please welcome her."

Amara walked onto the stage. The lights were bright enough that she couldn't see most of the audience, just silhouettes and the occasional reflection off tablets. She knew they were there—two hundred economists, policy makers, corporate representatives. People with power to change systems or bury research.

People about to hear things they didn't want to believe.

She pulled up her presentation. The title slide appeared on the massive screen behind her:

**"Liberation or Collapse? A Natural Experiment in Universal Basic Income"**
*Dr. Amara Osei, Department of Economic Sociology*

"Good afternoon," she began, forcing her voice steady. "For the past three months, I've been conducting field research in Nova Station's Sector 12, where an unusual economic intervention has created conditions for observing the effects of unconditional cash transfers on a population of approximately 200 individuals."

She clicked to the next slide. Methodology. Sample demographics. Research design.

"The intervention consists of monthly payments of 4,000 station credits—approximately twice the average monthly income for this population—with no strings attached. No work requirements. No means testing. No conditions."

A murmur ran through the audience. Amara pressed on.

"The corporate narrative, as reported by Corporate Media Network and echoed in economic policy discussions, suggests this intervention has led to labor force abandonment, social decay, and increased crime. My research examines whether this narrative aligns with empirical evidence."

Next slide. The data.

"After eleven months of observation, the evidence tells a different story."

She pulled up the comparison chart she'd been refining for weeks. Sector 12 versus Sector 14, the control population with similar demographics.

**Crime: -67% (S12) vs. +3% (S14)**

The murmuring grew louder.

**Emergency Healthcare: -52% vs. +8%**

**Mental Health Crises: -71% vs. +12%**

**Life Satisfaction: +156% vs. -8%**

"Interesting," Amara said, using her fuck-word deliberately. "Sectors receiving unconditional income show massive improvements in public health and safety. This contradicts assumptions about moral hazard and welfare dependency."

A hand raised in the audience. Amara ignored it. Kept presenting.

"Labor force participation did decline by forty-seven percent," she acknowledged. "However, this requires context."

Next slide. Breakdown of job types quit versus retained.

"Eighty-three percent of residents quit at least one job. But analysis shows they specifically quit jobs characterized by: below-subsistence wages, unsafe conditions, impossible hours, and no pathway to advancement. Jobs that economists might describe as 'economically coercive rather than voluntary.'"

She clicked again. "Meanwhile, thirty-one percent continued working in jobs they described as meaningful or enjoyable. And—this is crucial—volunteer labor increased three hundred and twelve percent."

Slide showing the community organizing. Photos of the garden, the repair collective, the childcare cooperative.

"When work is no longer coerced by threat of starvation, people don't stop contributing. They contribute differently. More of what matters. Less of what damages them."

Another hand raised. Amara still ignored it.

"The most significant finding relates to community formation." Next slide. "Mutual aid networks emerged spontaneously. Food cooperatives. Healthcare education. Childcare collectives. Systems for sharing skills and resources without monetary transaction. Gift economy principles operating at scale."

She pulled up quotes from her interviews, projected large on the screen:

*"I finally get to be a person instead of just labor hours." —Yuki T., age 28*

*"We're not lazy—we're just not desperate anymore." —Chen R., age 32*

*"The worst thing poverty does is make you police your own hope." —Marcus I., age 45*

Amara let those quotes sit. Watched the audience process them. Some people were leaning forward, engaged. Others were already typing on tablets—probably alerting someone that this presentation was problematic.

"Standard economic theory predicts that removing work incentives leads to social collapse," Amara continued. "My research suggests standard economic theory is measuring the wrong things."

She pulled up her final data slide. "If we measure human flourishing—health, happiness, community cohesion, mutual care—the intervention is an overwhelming success. If we measure corporate profitability and labor force compliance, it's a failure."

She paused. Let that land.

"The question is: which measurements should matter?"

Silence in the auditorium. The dangerous kind. The kind that meant people were rethinking foundations.

Or planning how to discredit her.

"In conclusion," Amara said, "the Sector 12 data demonstrates that universal basic income not only works but catalyzes positive social transformation. People given security without strings don't become lazy or dependent. They become generous. Creative. Community-oriented. They reclaim their humanity."

Final slide. Her conclusions:

**1. Economic coercion is not necessary for social contribution**
**2. Scarcity enforcement creates pathology, not character**
**3. Human nature trends toward cooperation when competition is removed**
**4. Current economic models prioritize control over wellbeing**

"Thank you. I'm happy to take questions."

The hands shot up immediately. Dozens of them.

The moderator pointed to someone in the front row. A man in an expensive suit. Amara's stomach sank—she recognized the corporate insignia.

"Dr. Osei," the man said, voice professionally friendly. "Fascinating presentation. I'm curious about your funding sources and whether they might introduce bias to your interpretations."

Translation: Who paid you to reach these conclusions?

"My research was self-funded and supported by my university position," Amara said calmly. "No external grants. No corporate sponsors. No conflicts of interest."

Another hand. A woman this time, academic robes. "You mention labor force participation declined forty-seven percent. How is that not concerning? How does a society function if half the workers quit?"

"The question assumes all current labor is necessary," Amara responded. "My research suggests much of it exists solely to justify subsistence wages, not to serve actual human need. When people quit these jobs, essential services continued through volunteer cooperation and skill-sharing."

She could see people calculating. Questioning. The academic in front row was typing furiously—probably already drafting a critical response paper.

More questions. Harder questions. Someone asked about sample size. Someone else questioned her methodology. A corporate economist asked if she'd considered the long-term sustainability of the funding source.

Amara answered each one. Stayed calm. Cited her data. Acknowledged limitations while standing by her conclusions.

Then a voice from the back. Older. Male. Authority in every syllable.

"Dr. Osei, I'm troubled by your framing."

Amara looked up. Couldn't see the speaker through the lights but recognized the voice.

Executive Director Jonathan Harris.

"Your research conflates receiving resources with flourishing," Harris continued. "But flourishing requires purpose. Contribution. The dignity that comes from earning one's place. What you're describing sounds less like liberation and more like learned helplessness masked as contentment."

The room went quiet. This was the moment. Corporate power speaking directly to academic research.

Amara took a breath. "Director Harris, with respect, my data doesn't support that interpretation. Residents didn't become helpless—they became empowered. They organized. Created systems. Took care of each other. That's not dependency. That's autonomy."

"But temporary autonomy," Harris countered. "Funded by irregular transfers that will eventually cease. What happens then? Don't you worry you've studied an artificial system disconnected from economic reality?"

"What I worry about," Amara said carefully, "is that we call the current system 'economic reality' when it's actually a choice. A choice to enforce scarcity. To make survival conditional on submission to exploitative labor. My research shows that's not necessary. Not for human flourishing. Only for maintaining existing power structures."

She hadn't meant to say it that directly. But it was out now. The truth. The thing her data proved but she wasn't supposed to say.

Harris was silent for a moment. Then: "Thank you for that perspective, Dr. Osei. I look forward to reading your full paper. If it's published."

The threat was gentle. Polite. Delivered with grandfatherly concern.

And absolutely explicit.

Amara met his eyes across the auditorium. "It will be published, Director. The data is already submitted to three journals. The truth doesn't require permission."

More silence. Tense silence. The whole room feeling the power dynamics suddenly visible.

Then applause. Not everyone. Maybe a third of the room. But real applause. From academics who'd been waiting for someone to say it. From younger researchers tired of self-censoring. From people who saw the data and couldn't unsee it.

The moderator stepped in. "Thank you, Dr. Osei, for a thought-provoking presentation. We'll take a fifteen-minute break before the next session."

Amara walked off stage on shaking legs. Her tablet immediately flooded with messages:

*Brilliant presentation.* *Your career is over.* *Can I cite your data?* *Corporate will destroy you.* *Finally someone said it.* *Methodologically flawed.* *Can we collaborate?* *You're insane.*

And one from Reed: *You did it. The data is out. Thank you.*

Amara found a quiet corner backstage and sat down heavily. Adrenaline fading into exhaustion and the dawning realization of what she'd just done.

She'd told the truth.

In public.

On the record.

To two hundred economists and corporate executives and policy makers.

She'd proven that universal basic income worked. That people thrived without coercion. That the entire economic system was built on unnecessary cruelty.

And she'd done it knowing it would cost her everything.

Her tablet buzzed again. Her department head: *We need to talk. Immediately.*

Then another message. Her advisor: *What were you thinking?*

Then university administration: *Emergency meeting requested by Board of Directors. Your presence required tomorrow, 09:00.*

Amara looked at the messages. At the beginning of the end of her career.

And felt something unexpected.

Peace.

She'd spent twelve years climbing out of poverty. Building credibility. Playing it safe. Being the success story that proved the system worked if you just tried hard enough.

And now she'd used all that credibility to prove the system was a lie.

It felt right.

Felt like finally choosing the truth over safety. Choosing the people of Sector 12 over her own prosperity score. Choosing to be someone who fought instead of someone who observed from a safe distance.

Her tablet buzzed one more time. Marcus Ibrahim: *Watched the livestream with the whole building. You were amazing. Thank you for seeing us as people.*

Amara smiled. Typed back: *Thank you for showing me what people can become. For proving the data right.*

She stood up. Straightened her professional clothes. Prepared to walk back into an auditorium full of people who would either embrace her research or destroy her credibility.

And she walked back in.

Head high.

Data solid.

Truth told.

Whatever came next, she'd done the right thing.

Even if it cost everything.
