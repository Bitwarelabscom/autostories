# Chapter 40: Forty-Eight Hours

Executive Director Jonathan Harris arrived at Reed's apartment at exactly 2:00 PM on a Thursday, accompanied by two medical professionals and zero security personnel.

That was the first surprise.

Reed had been expecting corporate security, threats, maybe an arrest warrant. Instead, Harris stood in his doorway wearing an expensive suit that probably cost more than Reed's entire annual drug revenue, looking like someone's friendly grandfather coming to deliver good news.

"Mr. Salazar," Harris said with a warm smile. "May I come in? I think we should talk."

Reed's hands were shaking. He'd taken Leveler two hours ago but his body was processing it wrong these days, the chemical steadiness coming slower and wearing off faster. He stepped aside.

"By all means. Director Harris in a Sector 12 apartment. Historic moment."

"Please, call me Jonathan." Harris entered, followed by the medical professionals who were carrying high-end diagnostic equipment. "I hope you don't mind—I brought Dr. Chen and Dr. Okafor. Specialists in renal failure treatment. I thought you might want to hear what they have to say."

That was the second surprise.

Reed sat down hard on his worn couch. "You know I'm dying."

"We've known for quite some time." Harris settled into the chair across from him, perfectly comfortable in a room that reeked of poverty and Leveler. "Your medical data has been... concerning. Dr. Chen, would you mind?"

Dr. Chen stepped forward with a portable scanner. "Mr. Salazar, with your permission, I'd like to run a quick assessment. Non-invasive, just to confirm our remote readings."

Reed laughed. The sound came out bitter. "Why not? Not like I can afford real medical care anyway."

The scan took three minutes. Dr. Chen's expression went carefully neutral as she reviewed the results.

"Your kidneys are operating at approximately 23% function," she said quietly. "You have significant toxin buildup from prolonged Leveler use. Without dialysis or transplant, you have perhaps three months. With treatment..." She looked at Harris.

"With treatment," Harris said gently, "you could live another forty years. Corporate medical technology has advanced considerably. We can grow you new kidneys from your own cells. Complete replacement, no rejection issues. Six-week procedure, three months recovery. You'd be healthier than you've been in a decade."

Reed stared at him. "In exchange for what?"

"Direct as always. I appreciate that." Harris leaned forward, his expression kind. "Reed—may I call you Reed?—I'm not here to threaten you. I'm here to make you an offer that benefits everyone involved."

"Everyone being corporate."

"Everyone being the station. Including you. Including Sector 12. Including the forty-seven thousand workers currently organizing strikes that are costing us millions in lost productivity." Harris gestured to the medical equipment. "You've made your point. Brilliantly, I might add. You've proven that unconditional income can transform a community. You've inspired labor organization across seventeen sectors. You've generated years of economic data that will be studied for decades."

"But?"

"But the experiment is unsustainable. Your funds are nearly depleted. You're dying. And when both run out, what happens to Sector 12?" Harris's voice was measured, reasonable. "We run models, Reed. Sophisticated projections. When the UBI payments stop abruptly, without transition support, without structural changes to replace that income—the crash will be devastating. Crime will spike. Health will decline. People will blame each other instead of understanding the systemic causes."

"That's speculation."

"That's data." Dr. Okafor handed Harris a tablet. He passed it to Reed. "Based on historical patterns of sudden aid withdrawal, economic shock models, and psychological studies of expectation disruption. The model shows an 83% probability of significant social disruption in Sector 12 within six months of payment cessation."

Reed looked at the projections. They were thorough, professionally done, and genuinely terrifying. Graphs showing crime rates spiking, health outcomes declining, community cohesion fragmenting.

"So what's your offer?" he asked.

Harris smiled. "I'm offering you a way to end this properly. With dignity. With legacy."

"Explain."

"You reveal yourself publicly. Hold a press conference. Explain that you conducted a well-intentioned experiment to test Universal Basic Income, but that the data shows it's unsustainable long-term. That people need purpose through work, not just money. That the real solution is corporate partnership and gradual reform."

Reed's hands shook harder. "You want me to lie."

"I want you to help transition Sector 12 to a sustainable model. We're prepared to offer jobs programs, educational opportunities, gradual economic integration. Real support, Reed, not just cash transfers. And in exchange—" Harris gestured to the doctors. "Complete medical care. New kidneys. Immunity from prosecution for theft of corporate assets. A substantial settlement—let's say twenty million credits—for your cooperation."

"Twenty million credits."

"Enough to live comfortably for the rest of your considerably extended life. Sector 8, if you prefer—better than Sector 12, but still connected to your roots. Healthcare for life. Prosperity score reset to mid-tier. You'd be respected, Reed. The man who tried an experiment and helped craft real solutions when it didn't work as hoped."

Dr. Chen added quietly, "The kidney replacement procedure is booked for next week if you accept. We can have you in surgery within seventy-two hours."

Reed looked at the medical equipment, the doctors, Harris's kind face. Everything he needed to survive was being offered on a silver platter.

All he had to do was betray everything he'd built.

"You have forty-eight hours to decide," Harris said. "I know this is a lot to process. But Reed, please—look at the data. Look at your body. You've proven your point. You've changed the conversation. Now let's work together to create something that actually lasts."

"And if I refuse?"

Harris's expression remained kind. "If you refuse, your money runs out in approximately four weeks. Your body follows in approximately eight. Corporate forensics will break your encryption within the month—we're close, Reed, closer than you think. Your accounts will be frozen, Sector 12's payments will stop abruptly with no transition, and everything you've built will collapse into chaos." He paused. "And you'll die in a Sector 12 community clinic, alone, knowing you could have prevented it all."

"Forty-eight hours," Reed said numbly.

"Forty-eight hours." Harris stood, straightened his suit. "I'll leave Dr. Chen's contact information. If you decide to accept, just call. We'll handle everything else." He moved toward the door, then turned back. "Reed, I'm not your enemy. I'm trying to help you. Help Sector 12. Help everyone. Think about it."

The door closed.

Reed sat alone in his apartment with forty-eight hours to decide between living and meaning.

Amara arrived seventeen minutes later, out of breath from running.

"Harris was here," Reed said before she could speak. "You probably saw him leave."

"I saw the medical equipment. Reed, what—"

"They offered me everything." Reed's hands wouldn't stop shaking. "New kidneys. Immunity. Twenty million credits. Life. All I have to do is publicly say the experiment failed and UBI doesn't work."

Amara sat down next to him. "Show me."

He handed her the tablet with Harris's projections. She read silently, her expression darkening.

"This is sophisticated manipulation," she said finally. "The data's not wrong, but the interpretation is. Yes, abrupt withdrawal would cause disruption. But that's not an argument against UBI—that's an argument for making it permanent."

"Tell that to Harris."

"Reed, you can't be considering this."

"I'm dying, Amara." Reed looked at his hands. At thirty-six years old, he looked fifty. Thin, sick, shaking. "Three months without treatment. Forty years with it. That's not a small difference."

"With the requirement that you destroy everything we've built."

"Is it destroying it? Or is it..." Reed struggled for words. "Harris is right about one thing. When the money runs out, there will be disruption. People will struggle. Some of what we built might not survive. If corporate's offering transition support, real programs—"

"Reed, stop."

"I'm just—"

"Stop." Amara grabbed his shaking hands, forced him to look at her. "Listen to me. Corporate is not offering transition support. They're offering propaganda. 'Jobs programs' means forcing people back into exploitative work. 'Educational opportunities' means training for corporate benefit. 'Gradual integration' means destroying everything Sector 12 has built and replacing it with the same system that killed your brother."

"You don't know that."

"Yes, I do. Because I've documented what happens when people have real security versus when they're dependent on corporate generosity. Reed, Sector 12 doesn't need corporate's 'help.' It needs time to build sustainable alternatives. Which is what we've been doing for four months."

"Four months isn't enough."

"Then we make it enough. We use every day, every credit, every connection to build infrastructure that survives. Cooperatives. Mutual aid. Democratic governance. Real alternatives." Amara's voice was fierce. "You don't save Sector 12 by telling people UBI failed. You save it by proving community can sustain itself."

Reed pulled his hands away. Stood up. Paced to the window.

"I'm tired," he said quietly. "I've been doing this for five years and I'm so fucking tired. And Harris is offering me a way out that doesn't end with me dead at thirty-six."

"Thirty-seven," Amara said. "You'll be thirty-seven in two months."

"Does that matter?"

"Yes. Because two months is enough time to transfer the last funds, document everything, set up succession structures, and record the truth. Two months is enough time to prove the experiment worked by letting it transition properly instead of being dismantled by corporate spin."

Reed laughed bitterly. "And then I die."

"And then you die having proven your brother didn't have to. Having shown forty-seven thousand workers there's another way. Having built something real that corporate can't erase no matter how hard they try." Amara stood, walked to him. "Reed, I won't tell you to die for this. That's your choice. But I will tell you what accepting means: you spend forty years living in Sector 8 knowing you sold out everyone who believed in you. Everyone who organized because they thought change was possible. Everyone who looked at Sector 12 and dared to hope."

"That's not fair."

"None of this is fair. Your brother working himself to death at twenty-five wasn't fair. Forty-three thousand people needing to strike for basic dignity isn't fair. You dying at thirty-six because Leveler is the only way to cope with poverty isn't fair." Amara's voice broke. "But you have a choice about what you do with the time you have left. And I need you to choose truth."

Reed leaned his forehead against the window. Outside, Sector 12 lived. People walking to community meetings. Kids in the common area. Yuki's rebuilt studio with art classes in session. All of it built on his money and their labor and five years of proving corporate wrong.

"Forty-eight hours," he whispered.

"Forty-eight hours," Amara agreed. "But Reed, please. Don't let them buy your death just because they're offering to delay it."

She left. Reed stood at the window, watching Sector 12, thinking about Marco.

His brother had never had a choice. Had worked until his body failed because the system didn't offer alternatives.

Reed had a choice.

Live forty years in comfortable complicity.

Or die in months having proven complicity wasn't inevitable.

He had forty-eight hours to decide.

---

At midnight, Reed pulled up his financial records. 847,000 credits remaining. Maybe three more payments if he was lucky. Four weeks until zero.

Then he pulled up Amara's data. Not Harris's projections—her raw research. Five years of documentation showing what Sector 12 had become. Crime down 74%. Health improved 85%. Community formation up 447%.

People thriving when given the chance.

He thought about Harris's offer. New kidneys. Immunity. Wealth. Life.

He thought about Marco, dead at twenty-five, who would have given anything for the chance Reed was being offered.

He thought about Yuki teaching art to kids who three years ago couldn't imagine having time for play.

He thought about Marcus, teaching organizing to workers who'd forgotten they had power.

He thought about forty-seven thousand people striking not because they had UBI, but because they'd seen what was possible and decided to fight for it.

Reed opened a new document.

Started typing.

**If I accept Harris's offer...**

But his hands were shaking too hard. He took more Leveler. Waited for it to kick in.

Tried again.

The cursor blinked. Forty-seven hours left to decide.

He needed to choose between living as a sellout or dying as proof that the system could be different.

Reed laughed darkly.

Five years ago, he'd been a burned-out dealer with nothing to lose.

Now he was a burned-out dealer with everything to lose.

Funny how that worked.

He saved the blank document. Closed the terminal.

Tomorrow he'd decide.

Tonight, he'd just try to breathe through the next forty-seven hours.
