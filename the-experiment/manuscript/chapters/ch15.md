# Chapter 15: Anonymous Contact

Dr. Amara Osei was different from what Reed had expected.

He'd been watching her for two weeks now, ever since she'd arrived in Sector 12 with her university credentials and her careful questions and her tablet that she took notes on constantly. Reed had expected another corporate researcher, another person who'd spend three days collecting data and then write a paper about how lower sector residents needed "better life skills training" or "financial literacy education."

But Amara actually listened.

Reed sat in his corner of the common area—his usual spot, invisible as always—and watched her interview Sarah Kim. Watched Amara lean forward, maintain eye contact, ask follow-up questions that showed she'd actually processed the previous answers. Watched her face when Sarah described working three jobs while raising two kids alone, and the expression there wasn't pity or judgment. It was recognition. Like she understood.

"The money changed everything," Sarah was saying. "Not just financially, though yes, that. But... I can help my kids with homework now. I can cook dinner instead of buying meal paste. I can sleep." Sarah's voice cracked slightly. "Do you know what it's like to sleep through the night without setting three alarms for three different shifts?"

"I do, actually," Amara said quietly. "I grew up in Sector 8. My mother worked the same way you did."

Sarah blinked. "You're from Sector 8?"

"Left for university. Scholarships, debt, the whole climb." Amara smiled, but it looked painful. "I don't tell people that usually. Academics from lower sectors are supposed to pretend we sprang fully formed from the middle class."

Sarah laughed, surprised. "So you get it."

"I'm trying to," Amara said. "That's why I'm here. The data I'm seeing contradicts every economic model I was taught. People are supposed to need work to have purpose, structure, meaning. But you're all..." She gestured around the common area—at the plants, the fixed furniture, the group of residents planning next week's community meal. "You're thriving. And the corporate narrative says that's impossible."

"The corporate narrative is horseshit," Sarah said flatly.

"Yeah," Amara agreed. "It really is."

Reed watched this exchange and made a decision he'd been circling for two weeks.

He was going to contact her.

---

The message took Reed six hours to compose.

He routed it through seven different anonymous relays, used encryption that would take corporate forensics weeks to crack, and sent it from a disposable account that would self-destruct after she replied.

Paranoid? Yes. But alive.

The message was simple:

*Dr. Osei,*

*I've been following your research in Sector 12. You're asking the right questions. I can provide data that will help you answer them.*

*I have detailed financial records of the UBI transfers—amounts, duration, recipient demographics, spending patterns. I also have documentation of social outcomes: employment changes, health metrics, community formation, crime statistics.*

*This data doesn't exist anywhere else. I've been collecting it from the beginning.*

*I need to remain anonymous. If you're interested in collaboration, reply to this message. It will self-destruct in 48 hours.*

*You should know: corporate is about to escalate their response to Sector 12. They see what's happening here as a threat. Your research is about to become very dangerous.*

*—A Friend of the Experiment*

Reed hovered over the send button for five full minutes.

This was the point of no return. Once Amara knew someone was actively documenting the experiment, actively providing data, she'd start looking for patterns. She was smart—that was obvious from watching her work. Eventually she might figure out who he was.

But she was also the only person who could take his data and turn it into something that mattered. Something beyond Building 7. Something that could prove Marco's death meant something.

He hit send.

Amara's reply came eighteen hours later.

Reed was dealing to Chen—who was down to buying Leveler once a week instead of daily, another data point—when his encrypted tablet pinged.

"You good?" Chen asked, noticing Reed's distraction.

"Yeah. Just... yeah." Reed completed the transaction mechanically, waited for Chen to leave, then opened the message.

*Friend,*

*I'm interested. Very interested.*

*I need to know: are you the source of the funds? Or are you observing same as me?*

*Either way, I want the data. My research is showing outcomes that contradict every economic assumption about UBI and work motivation. Concrete numbers would be invaluable.*

*You're right that this is dangerous. I've already had two calls from corporate liaisons 'checking in' on my research direction. Academic freedom is great until your findings threaten power structures.*

*I'm willing to protect your anonymity. I'm not willing to falsify data or soften conclusions to appease corporate interests.*

*If we're doing this, we're doing it right.*

*—Dr. Amara Osei*

Reed read it three times. She was careful. Didn't assume he was the source. Didn't promise things she couldn't deliver. But also—"we're doing it right."

She got it. She understood what was at stake.

He composed his reply:

*Dr. Osei,*

*I am the source. I found corporate money that wasn't supposed to exist and decided to run an experiment. I'm not an economist or a sociologist. I'm just someone who was tired of watching people die from the system.*

*I'm attaching the full dataset. Use it however helps your research. The only thing I ask: tell the truth. The data shows people aren't lazy when given security. They're human. Make sure that story gets told.*

*Re: corporate escalation—they're announcing new policies tomorrow. 'Sector optimization measures.' Watch for service cuts and 'prosperity recalibration fees.' They're going to make Sector 12 suffer to prove UBI doesn't work.*

*We need to document everything that happens next. This is where it gets ugly.*

*—Friend*

He attached his files: 400 pages of documentation, spreadsheets, interview notes, financial records. Ten months of careful observation. The evidence that the experiment was working.

Hit send.

Sat back.

Wondered if he'd just made the smartest decision of his life or signed his own death warrant.

Probably both.

The corporate announcement came the next morning, broadcast across every screen in Sector 12.

**PROSPERITY COLLECTIVE ANNOUNCES SECTOR OPTIMIZATION INITIATIVE**

Reed watched it in the common area, surrounded by dozens of other residents who'd been pulled from morning routines by the mandatory viewing notice.

Executive Director Jonathan Harris appeared on screen, perfect suit, grandfatherly smile, every inch the benevolent leader.

"Good morning, Nova Prosperity family," Harris said, voice warm. "As part of our ongoing commitment to sector wellness and economic sustainability, we're implementing several optimization measures in Sector 12."

Reed's stomach tightened.

"First, we'll be instituting prosperity recalibration fees to ensure fair resource distribution. Air quality enhancement, water purification, and common area maintenance will now include usage-based charges. These modest fees will help residents take ownership of their environmental impact."

Translation: charging people for services that were supposed to be basic rights.

"Second, we're adjusting the employment incentive structure. Residents will now be required to maintain minimum labor participation to qualify for sector services. We believe in the dignity of work and want to ensure everyone has opportunity to contribute."

Translation: work or lose access to basic services.

"Third, we're updating prosperity score calculations to better reflect community engagement. Residents who maintain active employment will see score improvements, while those who've voluntarily reduced labor participation may see adjustments."

Translation: they were going to tank the prosperity scores of anyone who'd quit their jobs, making it harder to access everything from healthcare to housing.

Harris's smile never wavered. "These changes reflect our commitment to helping Sector 12 residents achieve their full prosperity potential. Together, we rise!"

The screen went dark.

The common area was silent.

Then someone started laughing. Bitter, angry laughter that spread through the crowd like contagion.

"They're punishing us," Yuki said, voice shaking. "They're punishing us for being happy."

"Not punishment," Marcus corrected grimly. "They're trying to prove a point. Make us suffer enough that we go back to taking shit jobs, then they can say UBI failed. Say we only functioned when we were desperate."

"That's..." Sarah couldn't finish the sentence.

"Evil?" Chen supplied. "Yeah."

Reed watched the crowd, watched the anger and fear and dawning realization. Corporate wasn't going to let Sector 12 be a successful counterexample. Wasn't going to let people prove you could thrive without exploitation.

They were going to squeeze until Building 7 broke, until residents were desperate enough to go back to the old system, and then they'd write papers about how UBI created dependency and laziness.

His tablet pinged. A message from Amara.

*This is what you meant by escalation.*

*Yes,* Reed replied.

*How much can you increase funding to compensate?*

Reed did quick math. The new fees would cost residents roughly 800 credits per month in services they used to get free. 200 units times 800 credits was 160,000 additional per month.

*I can cover it,* he sent back. *Still have years of runway. But this won't be their only move.*

*No,* Amara agreed. *This is the opening salvo. They're going to keep escalating until something breaks.*

*Then we document everything,* Reed wrote. *Every punitive measure. Every fee increase. Every service cut. We prove they're the ones making people suffer, not UBI.*

*Agreed. Reed—can I call you Reed?*

He paused. She'd done the analysis. Looked at the data patterns, the language in his messages, the details only someone inside Building 7 would know. She'd figured it out.

*Yes,* he sent finally. *How long have you known?*

*Since the third data file you sent. You documented things only a dealer making rounds would see. And Building 7's dealer is Reed Salazar, former financial analyst, who'd have the skills to set up anonymous transfers.*

*Are you going to report me?*

There was a long pause.

*No,* Amara sent finally. *I'm going to help you prove this works. But Reed—they're going to find you eventually. Corporate has forensic accountants and surveillance that makes my research tools look like toys. You need an exit strategy.*

*I know.*

*Do you? Because from my data, you're still living in Building 7, still making your dealing rounds, still documenting in the same patterns. You're not acting like someone trying to hide.*

Reed looked around the common area. At Yuki talking to a group of residents about organizing a response to the new fees. At Marcus already calculating costs and discussing collective solutions. At Chen pulling up the community support network they'd built.

*I'm not hiding,* he sent back. *I'm watching what I started. These are my people.*

*They're not your responsibility,* Amara wrote.

*Yes they are,* Reed replied. *My brother died for this system. Died believing it was right, that he just needed to work harder. I'm not walking away while corporate tries to prove that people like Marco deserved what happened to them.*

Another pause.

*Okay,* Amara sent. *Then we fight. But carefully. I'll publish preliminary findings next month—data showing Sector 12's improvements are real and measurable. You keep the UBI running and document corporate's punitive response. We build a case that's too solid to ignore.*

*And when they find me?*

*Then we already have the evidence published. Your experiment will be on record. Whatever happens to you, the data survives.*

Reed stared at that message.

Whatever happens to you.

Yeah. That was the calculation, wasn't it? His life against the proof that the system was wrong. His safety against evidence that might change things for people like his brother.

Not even a hard choice, really.

*Deal,* he sent.

*Reed,* Amara wrote. *I need to meet you. Face to face. If we're collaborating this closely, I need to know who you really are.*

*Not yet,* Reed replied. *Too dangerous for both of us. Let's wait until your findings are published. Until there's official record that the experiment worked. Then if corporate finds me, they find me, but the truth is already out there.*

*You're really willing to die for this.*

Reed looked at his brother's name saved in his contacts, still there even though the number was disconnected. Looked at the memorial photo he kept on his tablet. Marco at twenty-five, already looking exhausted.

*I've been dead for five years,* Reed wrote back. *At least this way it means something.*

He closed the encrypted app before Amara could respond.

Around him, Building 7 was organizing. Residents were already planning how to share costs, how to pool resources, how to fight back against corporate's squeeze.

They weren't breaking. They were adapting.

Maybe that was the real experiment. Not whether people would work without desperation, but whether they'd fight for each other when the system tried to destroy them.

Reed opened his funding app and adjusted the next month's transfers. 2800 credits per unit instead of 2000. Enough to cover the new fees and then some.

Corporate wanted to prove UBI failed?

Let them try.

---

That night, Reed's tablet pinged with a final message from Amara.

*Just finished analyzing your full dataset. Reed, this is incredible. The crime reduction, health improvements, community formation—it's not just good, it's statistically revolutionary. This could change policy across all stations.*

*Will it though?* Reed wrote back. *Change policy? Or will corporate bury it?*

*That depends on how loud we make it,* Amara replied. *I'm presenting preliminary findings at the Interstation Economics Conference in six weeks. This data goes public then. With your permission.*

Reed thought about it. Public meant visible. Visible meant vulnerable. But also meant the experiment would be documented, analyzed, peer-reviewed. Would become part of the academic record.

Would mean Marco's death, and the death of everyone like Marco, would be proven unnecessary. Would prove the system killed people by choice, not necessity.

*You have my permission,* Reed sent. *Burn it all down, Dr. Osei.*

*Call me Amara. And Reed? Thank you. For the data, the trust, the experiment. For having the courage to ask 'what if.'*

*Thank Yuki. Thank Marcus. Thank everyone in Building 7 who was brave enough to believe the money might be real. I just moved numbers around. They're the ones who proved what people can become.*

*You're wrong,* Amara wrote. *But I'll argue with you about it when we finally meet.*

Reed smiled despite himself. *Looking forward to it.*

He closed the tablet and looked out his narrow window at Sector 12. At the lights of thousands of units, thousands of people, all of them trapped in the same grinding system that had killed his brother.

But in one building, 200 families were free.

And in six weeks, the whole station would know why.

Corporate could escalate all they wanted.

Reed had already won.

He just had to survive long enough to see it matter.
