# Chapter 6: Suspicion

The common area at 7 AM was more crowded than Reed had seen in years.

Usually people left for their shifts alone, staggered, avoiding eye contact and conversation. But today at least forty residents were clustered in small groups, talking in low voices, tablets out, comparing screens.

Reed sat in his corner with his own tablet, pretending to scroll through news while actually recording everything. His documentation project had officially begun.

"—checked three times, it's still there—"

"—has to be an error, they'll take it back—"

"—Future Forward Solutions, anyone heard of them?—"

"—probably corporate testing who has savings—"

"—my cousin in Sector 8 never got anything like this—"

The prevailing theory, Reed noted, was trap. Some kind of corporate test or scam or prosperity score manipulation. Nobody seemed to consider that it might just be... real. That someone might actually be giving them money.

Sarah Kim stood near the water dispenser, arms crossed, explaining her theory to a small audience. "It's debt forgiveness that they'll call a loan later. They give you 2000 now, charge you 4000 next month with interest. Classic predatory lending."

Several people nodded. That made sense. That was how the system worked.

"Or it's a tax thing," another resident suggested. "Give you money now, claim you owe taxes on it later. Ding your prosperity score for non-payment."

More nods. Also plausible. Also how the system worked.

Nobody suggested: maybe someone is just helping you.

Because that's not how anything worked.

Reed made his rounds that afternoon, watching reactions, asking careful questions.

"You see the money?" he asked Marcus during a pickup.

"Yeah." Marcus didn't look happy about it. "2000 credits. Just appeared. No explanation except some corporate message about a prosperity initiative."

"You going to spend it?"

"Hell no. It's sitting in my account until I know what the catch is." Marcus paused. "My daughter needs new shoes though. Her school ones are falling apart. And 2000 credits would cover it, plus groceries for a month, plus..." He stopped himself. "No. I'm not touching it. It's a trap."

"What if it's not?" Reed asked carefully.

Marcus looked at him strangely. "Why wouldn't it be? When has anyone ever just given us money?"

"Never," Reed admitted. "But what if this time is different?"

"Nothing's different, Reed. It's always the same." Marcus took his Leveler, paid his credits, looked tired in a way that went beyond physical. "The moment you start hoping is the moment they crush you. I learned that a long time ago."

Reed nodded like he understood. Like he agreed.

But he made a note: *Marcus scared to hope. Will wait for second month to believe.*

---

Yuki was more direct.

"It's fake, right?" they said when Reed found them in the common area that evening. "The money? It has to be fake."

"Did you check your account?"

"Seven times. It's there. 2000 credits. But it's not real." Yuki was talking fast, hands fidgeting, anxiety written across their whole body. "It's going to disappear. Or they'll say it was an error. Or they'll charge me for it later. Or—"

"What if it's real?" Reed interrupted.

Yuki stopped. Stared at him. "What?"

"What if someone actually just gave you money? What would you do with it?"

"I..." Yuki looked lost. "I don't know. I've never thought about that because it's never happened and never will happen and—" They laughed, slightly unhinged. "Why are you asking me this?"

"Curious," Reed said. "If you had 2000 credits you knew were really yours, no catch, what would you do?"

Yuki thought about it. Really thought about it. The anxiety on their face shifted to something else. Something Reed couldn't quite read.

"I'd quit my third job," Yuki said quietly. "The overnight cleaning one in Sector 8. I hate it. It pays almost nothing and I have to take two transits to get there and I never sleep and I..." They stopped. "But I can't quit because I need every credit to survive. So."

"So."

"But if the money was real. If it kept coming. If I could actually..." Yuki trailed off. "It's not real, Reed. It can't be real."

Reed made another note: *Yuki would quit worst job. Testing to see if money continues. Dreams of sleep.*

---

By evening, Reed had talked to twenty residents. Documented twenty reactions. Twenty variations on the same theme: suspicion, fear, waiting for the trap.

Only three people had spent any of the money.

Chen Rodriguez had bought protein (real protein, not paste) and eaten a meal that didn't come from a vending machine. "If it's fake, at least I ate well once," he'd said.

A woman Reed didn't know well had paid down 500 credits of debt, figuring if it was a trap, she'd at least reduced her interest burden temporarily.

And young David, Marcus's son, had bought art supplies for a school project. His mother had been furious—"We can't afford that!"—but David had argued the money was there, it was showing as real, and his project was due.

Everyone else was waiting. Saving. Holding the credits in their accounts like they might evaporate at any moment.

Which, Reed admitted, was smart. Nobody in Sector 12 survived this long without learning that hope was expensive.

---

That night, Reed lay in his bed and added to his documentation:

*Day 1 Post-Transfer: Widespread suspicion. Primary theories: corporate trap, prosperity score test, hidden debt, future taxation. Nobody believes in altruism. Why would they? System has trained them otherwise.*

*Three people spent money: Chen (food), Unknown Woman (debt), David Ibrahim (school supplies). Everyone else waiting.*

*Marcus: Scared to hope. Won't spend until sees second month.*

*Yuki: Would quit worst job if money is real. Currently paralyzed by disbelief.*

*Community gathering in common area—unusual. Crisis creates connection? Or just shared confusion?*

*Key observation: System has destroyed ability to receive help. Even when people desperately need support, they can't accept it because acceptance feels dangerous.*

*Question: How long until they believe it's real? What has to happen for hope to override survival instincts?*

Reed saved the file, encrypted it, and stared at his ceiling.

His experiment was running, but the variable he hadn't fully accounted for was fear. Not fear of corporate, but fear of hope itself. Fear that believing in something good would make the inevitable disappointment worse.

He understood that. Had felt it himself for five years.

But understanding didn't help him figure out how to overcome it.

The money was there. The system was working. But if people were too scared to use it, too trained by the system to accept help...

Then what?

Reed fell asleep without an answer.

Outside, Building 7 held its collective breath, waiting for the other shoe to drop.

Waiting for the trap.

Waiting to be proven right that nothing good ever came for free.

And in his corner, Reed Salazar waited to see if 2000 credits could overcome five years of trauma.

Or if hope, even when offered, was just too dangerous to accept.
