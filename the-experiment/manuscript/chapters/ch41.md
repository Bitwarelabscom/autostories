# Chapter 41: The Refusal

Reed called Director Harris at exactly 2:00 PM on Saturday, forty-eight hours after the offer.

He'd spent two days watching the clock, running numbers, imagining forty years of comfortable life in Sector 8. Reading Amara's data. Looking at Marco's memorial plaque. Calculating exactly how many more months he could buy with corporate kidneys and twenty million credits.

In the end, the math was simple.

Harris answered on the second ring. "Reed. I'm glad you called. Dr. Chen is standing by—we can have you in pre-op by this evening."

"I'm calling to say no."

Silence on the line. Reed could hear Harris breathing, recalculating, adjusting his strategy in real-time.

"Reed, I don't think you understand the timeline here. Without treatment—"

"I understand. Three months, give or take. Kidneys at twenty-three percent and failing. Body shutting down from Leveler poisoning. I've done the math, Jonathan. I'm good at math."

"Then why—"

"Because forty years living with what I'd done to get them isn't worth three months dying with my conscience intact." Reed laughed, the sound dry. "Turns out I'm not as nihilistic as I thought."

Another pause. When Harris spoke again, his voice had lost its friendly warmth. "Your accounts will be frozen within the hour. Corporate forensics has been waiting for this decision. Every credit you have access to will be locked."

"I know."

"Sector 12's UBI ends today. Not in four weeks. Today."

"I know that too."

"You're condemning people to poverty because of pride."

"I'm refusing to condemn people to corporate propaganda because of cowardice." Reed's hands were shaking. He didn't take more Leveler. Wanted to feel this clearly. "The experiment worked, Harris. You know it. I know it. The data proves it. And you want me to spend my last breath lying about that because it threatens your power."

"This isn't about power. It's about stability. Order. The functioning of the station."

"It's about control. And I'm done being controlled." Reed looked out his window at Sector 12. "Do what you're going to do. Freeze the accounts. End the payments. Send forensics. I've got maybe three months left and I'm spending them telling the truth."

"You're making a mistake."

"Probably. But it's my mistake to make."

Reed ended the call.

For exactly seventeen seconds, nothing happened.

Then every terminal in his apartment went red. Account access denied. Encryption protocols overridden. Corporate forensics flooding his systems like water through a broken dam.

They'd been ready. Waiting for his refusal. Probably had the override codes prepared for weeks.

Reed watched his remaining 847,000 credits turn to zero on the screen. Watched five years of careful routing and encryption collapse in real-time. Watched the UBI experiment end not with careful transition but with corporate-forced cessation.

His encrypted channel chimed. Amara.

*A: They froze it all.*

*R: I know. I can see the forensics.*

*A: Sector 12's payment system just went offline. People are already getting error messages.*

*R: I know that too.*

*A: Reed. What did you do?*

*R: I chose.*

A pause. Then: *Good.*

The community meeting happened that evening in Sector 12's main common area. Three hundred people showed up—more than the space could hold, bodies pressed together, spilling into corridors.

Reed attended in person. No more hiding. No more encryption. Corporate knew who he was, where he was, what he'd done. The only power he had left was visibility.

Marcus Ibrahim stood at the front, his voice carrying over the crowd. "For those who haven't checked their accounts: the UBI payments have stopped. Corporate frozen the source. We don't know if they'll restart."

Murmurs through the crowd. Fear. Anger. Confusion.

"But," Marcus continued, "we need to talk about what we do have. Because five years of breathing room gave us something corporate can't freeze."

Yuki stepped forward. "We have the cooperatives. Childcare collective, food distribution, skill-sharing networks. We've been building infrastructure alongside the UBI for two years. It's not the same as two thousand credits a month, but it's real."

"We have negotiating power," someone else called out. Shen, from the childcare coop. "Corporate can't run the station without workers. The cross-sector organizing didn't need UBI money—it needed us to remember we're human beings who deserve better."

"We have each other," Marcus said quietly. "That's not nothing."

Reed stood in the back, watching. No one had called him out yet. Half the room probably knew he was the source. The other half suspected. But no one demanded explanation. No one blamed him for the money running out.

They were too busy planning what came next.

Amara found him in the crowd. Stood next to him without speaking.

"They're doing it," Reed said quietly. "Building what comes after."

"Did you think they wouldn't?"

"I hoped. Didn't know." Reed's chest felt tight. "Harris was wrong. He said ending the payments would cause chaos. But look at them."

The meeting had broken into working groups. People organizing emergency mutual aid, planning resource sharing, drafting demands to present to corporate. Sector 12 had three hundred people actively building alternatives to both UBI and corporate exploitation.

"How long do you have?" Amara asked.

"Medically? Dr. Chen said three months. But that was with baseline Leveler use. I'm using more now—stress, you know. So maybe two. Maybe less."

"And the accounts?"

"Frozen completely. Corporate forensics broke everything. I've got about two thousand personal credits left from old dealing days. Enough to eat for a month if I'm careful."

Amara pulled out her tablet. "I have seventy-three thousand credits saved. Consulting work, book royalties. It's yours."

"Amara, no—"

"It's not for you. It's for the documentation project." She showed him a proposal. "We have two months, maybe less. I want to record everything. Interviews with everyone whose life changed. Your full accounting of the experiment. Economist analysis. Sociological data. Proof that UBI worked. And then we publish it everywhere corporate can't suppress it."

"You're asking me to spend my last two months as a research subject."

"I'm asking you to spend your last two months proving your brother didn't die for nothing." Amara's voice was fierce. "Corporate wants to bury this. Wants to say the experiment failed. We make sure that's impossible."

Reed looked at the meeting. At Yuki organizing art classes that would continue without payment. At Marcus teaching organizing skills to twenty-year-olds who'd never lived through the old union days. At three hundred people refusing to believe poverty was inevitable.

"Okay," he said. "Let's document it all."

That night, Reed's terminal chimed with an official corporate message:

**NOTICE OF CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION**
**Reed Salazar: You are hereby notified that Prosperity Collective Inc. has opened a formal investigation into theft of corporate assets (500M credits), fraud, and unauthorized distribution of restricted funds. You are required to appear for questioning within 72 hours. Failure to appear will result in immediate arrest warrant.**

Reed read it twice. Laughed.

They were threatening to investigate him for three months. By the time they scheduled an arraignment, he'd be dead.

He sent the notice to Amara with a note: *They're going to investigate me for longer than I have left to live. Corporate efficiency at its finest.*

Her response came immediately: *Can they arrest a corpse for contempt of court?*

*Let's find out.*

Reed stood up. Looked around his apartment—the same space he'd lived in for fifteen years. Dealt drugs from this room. Found the data chip that changed everything. Managed five years of UBI transfers. Watched Sector 12 transform through that window.

He had two months. Maybe less.

Time to make them count.

He opened a new document on his terminal—one of the few corporate hadn't locked when they froze his accounts. Started typing.

**THE SALAZAR EXPERIMENT: A Complete Accounting**

**Day 1: I found 500 million credits and had a stupid idea...**

The words came slowly at first. Then faster. Reed typed through the night, documenting everything. The courier's death. The data chip. The first transfer. Watching Sector 12 transform. The trial. The strikes. Meeting Amara. Harris's offer.

All of it. Truth without filter or corporate euphemism.

At dawn, he'd written seventeen thousand words. His hands were shaking worse than ever—Leveler wearing off, kidneys processing slower. But the document was there. Real. Permanent.

Amara messaged: *You haven't slept.*

*R: Can't afford to. Limited time.*

*A: You need to rest or you'll burn out faster.*

*R: I'm going to burn out anyway. Might as well use the flame while it lasts.*

*A: Reed.*

*R: I'm okay. Really. For the first time in five years, I know exactly what I'm doing and why. That's worth more than sleep.*

He saved the document. Backed it up to three different locations Amara had set up. Sent copies to encrypted networks corporate couldn't touch.

Then he took his Leveler dose and started typing again.

Two months to document five years.

Two months to prove Marco's death meant something.

Two months to make sure that when Reed Salazar died, the truth died with him.

Outside his window, Sector 12 woke up to its first day without UBI payments.

And immediately started organizing to prove they didn't need them anymore.
