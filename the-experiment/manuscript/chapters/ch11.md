# Chapter 11: The Hit Pieces

The first piece aired on Corporate Media Network at prime time: 18:00, when people were either getting home from work or heading to their second shift. The algorithm knew exactly when to deliver maximum impact.

Reed watched it on the communal screen in Building 7's common area, surrounded by the same people the broadcast was about. Yuki sat to his left, sketching in their pad. Marcus stood in the back, arms crossed. Chen, Sarah, Liu, Indira—all of them there, watching themselves be translated into corporate narrative.

The CMN logo filled the screen. Gleaming. Professional. The voice-over was warm, concerned, the audio equivalent of a sympathetic smile.

*"Tonight on Prosperity Focus: The troubling trend emerging from Sector 12, where a culture of entitlement is threatening station-wide economic stability."*

"Oh good," Reed said flatly. "We're entitled now."

The screen cut to the anchor, a perfectly groomed man in an expensive suit. He had that particular smile executives learned—friendly but not warm, concerned but not distressed, the smile of someone explaining why your suffering was actually an opportunity.

"I'm your host, Marcus Venn," the anchor said, and Reed heard Marcus Ibrahim snort at the name. "And tonight we're investigating a disturbing phenomenon that threatens the very foundation of our shared prosperity."

Cut to b-roll footage of Sector 12. Except it wasn't real footage—it was stock shots from the industrial sectors mixed with carefully selected clips that made everything look decrepit and abandoned. Empty corridors. Closed shop fronts. The one image of people was a group standing around in the common area, framed to look like loitering rather than community.

"For six months," Venn continued, "Sector 12 has experienced what economists are calling a 'labor defection event.' Across multiple industries, workers are simply... disappearing."

The screen showed a corporate manager. The name tag read: *Gerald Houston, Operations Director, ProspectCafe*. He looked exhausted and genuinely frustrated.

"We've lost thirty percent of our overnight workforce," Houston said. "People just stop showing up. No notice. No explanation. They just vanish from the labor pool."

"And what impact has this had on your business?" Venn's voice, off-camera, dripping with sympathy.

"Catastrophic. We're a 24-hour operation. We serve the workers who keep this station running. When our team members choose to prioritize personal comfort over their commitment to prosperity, everyone suffers."

Reed's jaw tightened. Personal comfort. Yuki had worked overnight shifts for four years, sleeping ninety minutes at a time, anxiety disorder untreated because they couldn't afford care. But sure. Personal comfort.

Cut back to Venn in the studio. "Personal comfort over commitment. It's a phrase we're hearing a lot from the sectors affected by what some are calling the 'Sector 12 crisis.'"

"Crisis," Yuki muttered. "We're happy. That's a crisis."

The broadcast continued. Another manager, this one from CleanSweep Maintenance. A woman named Rodriguez who Reed vaguely recognized—she'd always seemed decent, actually.

"I understand people need work-life balance," Rodriguez said carefully, and Reed could hear the corporate media training in her phrasing. "But when half your team decides they'd rather pursue hobbies than contribute to essential services, it impacts everyone. Cleanliness isn't optional. Maintenance isn't optional. These are the foundations of shared prosperity."

The framing was perfect. Not "workers are escaping exploitative conditions" but "workers are abandoning essential services." Not "people can finally afford to live on less work" but "people are choosing hobbies over contribution."

Cut to new footage. A corporate economist, identified as Dr. Evan Harris, Economic Policy Advisor for the Prosperity Collective. He was older, grandfatherly, had the kind of face that made you want to trust him. When he spoke, his tone was gentle. Understanding. Disappointed but not angry.

"What we're seeing in Sector 12 is a natural experiment in what happens when the social contract is broken," Harris said. "Now, we don't know the source of these... let's call them 'irregular transfers'... but we do know the result. When people receive resources without corresponding productivity, it creates what we call 'prosperity erosion.' Not just for them, but for everyone."

Reed leaned forward. This was new. Harris was acknowledging the money existed, which meant corporate knew. Of course they knew. They'd probably been investigating for months.

"The data is concerning," Harris continued, and a graph appeared on screen. It showed Sector 12's "productivity metrics" plummeting over six months. "Labor participation down forty-seven percent. Consumption patterns disrupted. Traditional prosperity indicators in decline."

The graph was technically accurate but utterly dishonest. Labor participation was down because people quit terrible jobs. Consumption was "disrupted" because people were buying different things—fresh food instead of Leveler, education instead of medical debt. Prosperity indicators looked bad because corporate's indicators measured exploitation.

"And here's what worries me most," Harris said, leaning into the camera with grandfatherly concern. "These irregular transfers won't last forever. Nothing does. And when they stop—and they will stop—these folks in Sector 12 will find themselves without work history, without skills development, without the prosperity foundation that comes from dedicated contribution. They're not being helped. They're being harmed."

"Fuck you," Chen said from across the room. "I can sleep now. That's harm?"

But the broadcast wasn't done. Cut back to Venn in the studio, his expression grave.

"We reached out to several Sector 12 residents for comment," he said, "but most declined to speak with us."

Because you didn't ask, Reed thought. Or you asked and then cut anyone who contradicted your narrative.

"However," Venn continued, "we did speak with some community members who are concerned about what they're seeing."

The screen cut to an interview. A man Reed didn't recognize—maybe late fifties, wearing a Sector 12 worker uniform but looking too clean, too polished.

"I've lived in Sector 12 for twenty years," the man said. "And I've never seen morale this low. People used to take pride in their work. Now everyone just wants handouts. It's created division. Those of us still working, still contributing—we're looked down on. Like we're fools for maintaining our prosperity scores."

"Plant," Marcus said immediately. "Corporate plant. Nobody in this building talks like that."

Reed agreed. The man's phrasing was too perfect, too aligned with corporate messaging. "Maintaining our prosperity scores" instead of "trying to survive." "Handouts" instead of "mysterious money." This was scripted.

The interview continued. "And the crime," the plant said, shaking his head. "With so many people idle, just hanging around all day, the crime has skyrocketed. I don't feel safe in my own building anymore."

"Crime is down sixty-seven percent," Marcus said loudly. "We have the data."

But CMN didn't have that data. Or if they did, they weren't sharing it.

Cut back to Venn. "Crime up. Morale down. Productivity collapsed. These are the real-world consequences when the social contract is abandoned. When contribution becomes optional."

The broadcast shifted to a new segment. "So what's being done? We spoke with Director of Resource Allocation Jennifer Wu about the board's response."

Wu appeared on screen. Mid-forties, sharp suit, the kind of executive who'd optimized her entire appearance for maximum authority. Her smile was professionally sympathetic.

"First, let me be clear," Wu said. "We care deeply about our pre-prosperous citizens in Sector 12. Their wellbeing is our highest priority."

"Pre-prosperous," Reed muttered. The corporate euphemism for poor. Never say poor. Never admit the system created poverty. Just "not prosperous yet."

"That's why," Wu continued, "we're implementing targeted support measures to help these community members return to productive, fulfilling lives."

The phrasing made Reed's skin crawl. "Support measures" meant punishment. "Help them return" meant force them back to work.

"We're introducing prosperity incentive adjustments," Wu said, and a helpful graphic appeared listing the measures:

- Service tier recalibrations for areas with low labor participation
- Prosperity score optimization requirements
- Enhanced monitoring for irregular financial activity
- Targeted resource allocation to encourage workforce re-engagement

Reed translated mentally:
- Cut services to Sector 12
- Make it harder to maintain prosperity scores
- Investigate everyone's finances
- Make life worse until people are desperate enough to take shit jobs again

"The goal," Wu said with that same sympathetic smile, "is to empower our Sector 12 neighbors to rediscover the dignity of contribution. Because ultimately, prosperity isn't about credits in an account. It's about purpose. Community. The pride that comes from knowing your work matters."

"The pride," Yuki said, voice shaking, "of making coffee at 3 AM for assholes who don't look at you."

Marcus put a hand on their shoulder.

The broadcast wrapped up with Venn back in the studio. "Sector 12's crisis is a warning for all of us. A reminder that true prosperity comes not from what we receive, but from what we contribute. Coming up after the break: how you can protect yourself from prosperity erosion in your own sector."

The CMN logo. A motivational jingle. Cut to commercial—an ad for productivity enhancement medication.

Reed sat in silence. Around him, the common area was quiet. Everyone processing what they'd just seen. Their lives, their transformation, their happiness—translated into crisis. Reframed as social pathology. Weaponized into a cautionary tale.

"They didn't talk to any of us," Yuki said finally. "Not really. They interviewed managers and that fake guy and economists, but not one person who actually got the money."

"That's the point," Marcus said. "Can't have the narrative contradicted by reality."

Sarah Kim stood up, angry. "Crime is down. We have the data. Health is better. People are happier. How do they just lie?"

"It's not lying if you believe it," Reed said quietly. "Harris probably really thinks we're being harmed. Can't imagine a world where people are worth more than their labor, so anything else must be pathology."

Chen was pacing. "So what do we do? Just let them tell these stories?"

"We could make our own media," Liu suggested. "Document the reality. Put it online."

"They'll bury it," Marcus said. "Corporate controls the algorithms. Controls what people see. Our truth doesn't fit the narrative, so it won't spread."

Reed stood up. His hands were shaking—not from the Leveler, but from rage. From watching these people he'd come to know translated into a threat. Into a problem to be solved.

"They're going to make things worse," he said. "All those 'support measures.' They're going to cut services, increase costs, make Sector 12 suffer. Try to prove that UBI doesn't work by sabotaging it."

"Can you increase the transfers?" Yuki asked. "If they raise costs, can you compensate?"

Reed considered this. He had the money. Could absolutely increase payments to offset corporate interference. But that wasn't sustainable. The fund was large but not infinite.

"Short term, yes," he said. "But if they're actively trying to make the experiment fail..."

"Then we organize," Marcus said. His voice had the weight of experience. "We can't win a media war against corporate. But we can take care of each other. Share resources. Build mutual aid networks. Make it harder for them to divide us."

"Will that work?" Sarah asked.

"It did once," Marcus said. "Back when we had unions. Before they crushed them. Collective power is the only power workers have."

---

Over the next week, three more hit pieces aired. Each one variations on the same theme: Sector 12 in crisis. Workers abandoning responsibility. Mysterious money corrupting work ethic. The need for intervention.

The pieces never interviewed anyone who'd actually received the transfers. Never showed Yuki's art or Marcus's kids' test scores or Chen finally sleeping through the night. Never mentioned that crime was down, health was up, community was forming.

Just managers complaining about labor shortages. Economists warning about "prosperity erosion." Corporate spokespeople promising "support measures."

And between the broadcasts, the online discourse exploded. Other sectors saw the coverage and debated:

*SectorChat Forum - Sector 8*
> ProudWorker-447: "Sector 12 is getting exactly what they deserve. Nobody owes you prosperity."
>
> Reality-Check-089: "But the reporting seems weird? They didn't interview any actual residents."
>
> ProudWorker-447: "Because the residents are too ashamed to admit they're lazy."

*SectorChat Forum - Sector 23*
> Exhausted-in-23: "Okay but what if Sector 12 has it right? What if we're all just... too tired to think clearly?"
>
> SystemOptimized: "That's exactly the entitlement mindset that destroys stations. Work creates meaning."
>
> Exhausted-in-23: "Does it though? Or have we just been told that until we believed it?"

Reed watched the discourse from his tablet, documenting everything. The corporate narrative was winning in the broader station consciousness. But cracks were appearing. People questioning. Wondering.

The fourth broadcast was different. This one featured Executive Director Harris himself, in a one-on-one interview with Marcus Venn.

"Director Harris," Venn said with deep respect, "thank you for joining us."

"Of course, Marcus." Harris smiled warmly. He was good at this—the friendly authority figure. "This issue is too important not to discuss directly."

"Let's address the question everyone's asking: who is behind these transfers? Who's funding the Sector 12 situation?"

Harris leaned back, thoughtful. "You know, we have some theories. Financial forensics can tell us quite a lot. But I think the 'who' is less important than the 'why.'"

Reed went very still.

"Someone," Harris continued, "with access to significant capital, has decided to run an experiment. To see what happens when people receive resources without earning them. And I understand the impulse. I really do. We all want to help our pre-prosperous neighbors. But here's what this experiment is proving: people need purpose. Need contribution. Need to feel they're part of something larger than themselves."

"And work provides that," Venn prompted.

"Exactly. Work isn't just about credits. It's about dignity. Community. Belonging. When you remove that—even with good intentions—you don't liberate people. You hollow them out."

Reed's hands clenched. Harris genuinely believed it. Believed that forcing people into terrible jobs at poverty wages was dignity. That exploitation was belonging. That exhaustion was purpose.

"So your message to whoever is funding this experiment?" Venn asked.

Harris looked directly at the camera. Directly at Reed.

"Stop," he said gently. "You're hurting these people. You think you're helping, but you're not. Let them return to normal lives. Let them rebuild their prosperity through contribution. Let us help them the right way—through opportunity, not handouts."

The broadcast ended.

Reed sat in his apartment alone, staring at the blank screen.

They knew. Maybe not his identity, but they knew someone was doing this deliberately. Knew it was an experiment. Were probably close to finding him.

He could stop. Shut it all down. Disappear into the background static of poverty.

Or he could keep going. Increase the transfers to compensate for corporate interference. Prove that people thrived not because they were getting handouts, but because they were finally free from coercion.

Reed pulled up his financial dashboard. The fund that had started at 500 million. The transfers that had been going out for six months.

He increased the monthly payment from 2,000 to 2,500 credits.

Sent out a message to all recipients: *Cost of living adjustments incoming. Don't let them grind you back down.*

Then he opened a new file and started documenting the hit pieces. Every lie. Every omission. Every piece of propaganda.

Someday, someone would want the real data. The real story.

And Reed would make sure it existed.
