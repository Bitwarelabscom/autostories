# Chapter 7: The First Changes

The second transfer hit at 6 AM on the first day of month two.

Reed was awake to see it, because he'd barely slept, because this was the moment that would determine if his experiment had a chance. If the money came again, people might start to believe. If it didn't...

Well. If it didn't, then he'd just been a one-time philanthropist with stolen money, and nothing would change.

**FUTURE FORWARD SOLUTIONS - MONTHLY DISTRIBUTION COMPLETE**

**200 ACCOUNTS CREDITED**

Reed exhaled. Okay. Second month done. Now to see if anyone believed it.

---

The common area at 7 AM was packed.

Every chair filled, people standing, the crowd spilling into the corridors. Reed had never seen this many residents in one place. Never seen this much... energy. Not quite excitement, not yet, but something close. Something Reed couldn't quite name.

"It came again," someone said, voice loud in the previously quiet space.

"Same amount. 2000 credits."

"Same source. Future Forward Solutions."

"So it's not an error."

That realization rippled through the crowd. Not an error. Possibly not a trap. Definitely happening twice now.

Sarah Kim was recalculating her theories. "Could still be a loan scheme. Two months to get us dependent, then they spring the repayment terms."

But she sounded less certain than last month.

Marcus was standing near the back, tablet in hand, staring at his account balance like it might bite him. Reed watched him from his corner. Watched the older man's face cycle through emotions: disbelief, hope, fear, calculation.

"My daughter needs shoes," Marcus said, not to anyone in particular. Just... out loud. To the room. To himself.

No one responded. But several people nodded.

"I'm buying the shoes," Marcus continued, voice getting stronger. "If it's a trap, I'm already fucked. Might as well let my daughter have decent shoes while we wait."

Someone laughed. Not mocking—something else. Relief, maybe. Permission.

"I'm paying down debt," another voice called out.

"I'm buying real food. Fuck meal paste."

"I'm getting my medication refilled. The real stuff, not the generic that doesn't work."

The room erupted in a dozen conversations. People planning. People calculating. People allowing themselves to think about what they'd do with security they'd never had before.

Reed documented it all, fingers flying across his tablet:

*Day 1, Month 2: Second transfer successful. Community belief shifting from 'is it real?' to 'what do we do with it?' Permission structure emerging—Marcus buying shoes gave others permission to spend.*

*Collective decision-making happening. People aren't hoarding anymore. They're planning.*

*First hint of possibility thinking.*

By week two of month two, Reed's Leveler sales had dropped 20 percent.

Marcus was his first loss—not as a customer completely, but reduced frequency. "Don't need it every day anymore," Marcus explained during a pickup. "Can sleep better. Less stressed about money. Still need it for pain, but not for... everything else."

Yuki was next. They still bought, but once a week instead of daily. "I'm not as anxious," they said, sounding almost confused by this. "Like, I'm still anxious—that's just who I am—but it's not the constant terror anxiety. It's just... normal anxiety?"

Chen had stopped entirely. "Don't need it," he said simply. "Sleeping enough now. Eating real food. Body doesn't hurt as much."

Reed documented the trend: *Leveler use correlating directly with desperation. When basic needs secure, people need less chemical support to function. Obvious in retrospect. System creates addiction by creating desperation.*

He should be concerned about his income. Wasn't. Had 500 million credits. Watching people need his product less was better data than any amount of money.

Week three, the first resignation happened.

Chen Rodriguez quit his overnight cargo processing job.

Reed heard about it through the building network before Chen confirmed it himself. They met in the common area—Chen looking shell-shocked and terrified and exhilarated all at once.

"I did it," Chen said. "Just... walked into the supervisor's office and quit. And he was so confused because nobody quits. People get fired or die, but they don't quit."

"How do you feel?" Reed asked.

"Fucking terrified," Chen laughed. "The money's going to disappear. It's going to turn out to be fake. I just destroyed my employment history and my prosperity score for 2000 credits a month that probably aren't real."

"But if they are real?"

"Then I just got my life back." Chen's eyes were bright. "Reed, I slept eight hours last night. Eight. Straight. Hours. Do you know when I last did that?"

"No."

"Neither do I. Literally cannot remember." Chen sat down, still laughing that unhinged laugh. "I'm either the smartest person in Sector 12 or the dumbest. And I won't know which until the third month's money comes or doesn't."

Reed made a note: *First full job resignation. Chen quit worst job (overnight shift). Terrified but exhilarated. Sleeping 8 hours. Employment history damaged but quality of life improved immediately. Waiting for month 3 to validate decision.*

"You're documenting this, aren't you?" Chen asked, noticing Reed's tablet.

"Yeah."

"Why?"

"Someone should," Reed said simply. "Someone should record what happens when people in Sector 12 get a choice."

Chen looked at him for a long moment. "You're weird, Reed. But okay. Document me. Document that I chose sleep over labor. Document that I'd rather risk everything than keep working overnight shifts in a freezer."

"Documented," Reed said.

End of month two, Reed compiled his observations:

**MONTH 2 SUMMARY:**

- Second transfer successful, community belief increased significantly
- Spending patterns: 78% of residents spent at least part of money
- Primary purchases: food (42%), medical (31%), debt reduction (23%), other (4%)
- Leveler sales down 20% - correlation with reduced desperation
- First full job resignation: Chen Rodriguez (overnight cargo processing)
- Common area usage up 300% - community forming
- Visible health improvements: better sleep, better nutrition, less stress
- Prosperity scores: 43% of residents saw increases (more able to maintain employment well), 57% saw decreases (corporate penalizing reduced labor participation)

**KEY OBSERVATION:** People are not becoming lazy. They're becoming strategic. Quitting worst jobs, keeping better ones. Not stopping work, stopping exploitation.

**CONCERNS:** Corporate will notice the labor shortage. Sector 12 cargo processing already posting about staffing problems on internal networks.

**PREDICTION:** Month 3 will see accelerated job departures. People are waiting to see if money comes a third time. Once it does, floodgates open.

Reed saved the file and leaned back.

It was working.

People weren't becoming degenerates. Weren't laying around doing nothing. They were sleeping and eating and healing and starting to make choices about their labor instead of just accepting whatever exploitation was offered.

His brother had died thinking he had to work three jobs. Thinking that was normal, necessary, the only way.

But it wasn't.

Reed was proving it wasn't.

The question now was: how long before corporate noticed? How long before they started pushing back?

His tablet chimed—a news alert.

**SECTOR 12 BUSINESSES REPORT STAFFING CHALLENGES**

*Multiple Sector 12 employers are reporting difficulty maintaining staffing levels as workers unexpectedly leave positions. "We've had five resignations this month," reports cargo supervisor Danielle Chen. "That's unprecedented. We've never seen this kind of voluntary attrition before."*

So. Corporate had noticed.

Reed read the article, made notes, and prepared for whatever came next.

The experiment was working.

Which meant corporate would try to stop it.

The question was: how hard would they push? And would the people of Building 7 push back?

Reed looked out his window at Sector 12, at the thousands of apartments and millions of exhausted people, and wondered if 200 families with hope could change anything.

Or if the machine would just grind them back down.

Month three would tell him.

He just had to survive long enough to document it.
