# Chapter 14: Data Collection

Week three of fieldwork, and Amara Osei's preliminary dataset was becoming undeniable.

She sat in the community center at 22:30, long after most residents had gone home, staring at the statistical analysis on her laptop. Twenty-six interviews completed. Forty-seven surveys. Health records from the free clinic. Crime reports from sector security. Employment data from corporate databases. Economic indicators. Social network analysis.

All of it pointing the same direction.

All of it proving corporate was lying.

Amara pulled up the comparison chart she'd been building:

**Sector 12 (with UBI) vs. Sector 14 (control, similar demographics):**
- Crime: -67% vs. +3%
- Emergency healthcare: -52% vs. +8%
- Preventive healthcare: +89% vs. -2%
- Mental health crisis incidents: -71% vs. +12%
- Reported life satisfaction: +156% vs. -8%
- Labor force participation: -47% vs. +2%
- Volunteer hours: +312% vs. +5%
- Community organization participation: +423% vs. -1%

The pattern was overwhelming. Remove the threat of starvation and people didn't collapse into laziness. They thrived. Became healthier, happier, more engaged with their communities. Worked less in exploitative jobs but contributed more through mutual aid and volunteer work.

The data was beautiful.

The data was also dangerous.

Amara saved the file. Encrypted it. Backed it up to three separate servers, the paranoia of someone who'd grown up watching corporate make inconvenient things disappear.

Her tablet buzzed. Another email from her department head: *Board is asking for status update on Sector 12 research. They're particularly interested in findings related to labor participation and social stability. Can you prioritize those metrics?*

Translation: Tell us the experiment is failing. Tell us people are lazy and communities collapse without work discipline. Tell us the story we need to justify the "support measures" we're implementing.

Amara didn't respond. Opened her interview notes instead.

Interview #27 was Sarah Kim, mid-forties, former pharmaceutical assembly worker. She arrived exactly on time, calm in a way Amara was learning to recognize—the specific calmness of people who'd been anxious for years and only recently found peace.

"Thank you for meeting with me," Amara said, going through the consent protocol. "I want to understand your experience before and after the transfers began. Can you start by telling me about your life eight months ago?"

Sarah settled into her chair. Smiled slightly. "Eight months ago I worked pharmaceutical assembly. Forty hours a week standing at a machine, putting pills in bottles. The repetition was... I'm going to use the word 'murderous.' Same motion, eight hours a day, your brain just shuts off. And I took Leveler because everyone did. To manage the monotony. To manage the despair of knowing this was it, this was my life forever."

Amara made notes. "And when the transfers started?"

"I kept working. Kept taking Leveler. Didn't trust the money to continue." Sarah's expression shifted, something like wonder. "But it did continue. And after three months I thought: what if I quit? What if I just... stopped?"

"What happened when you stopped?"

"I crashed." Sarah said it matter-of-factly. "I'd been taking Leveler for six years. I went through withdrawal. It was terrible. But I had time to go through it properly because I wasn't working. Had community support. Marcus helped—he'd been through Leveler dependence too. And when I came out the other side..."

She paused, searching for words.

"I felt things again," she said finally. "That's what Leveler does—it mutes everything. Makes you functional but flat. And I thought that was just who I was now. But without the drug and without the job that made me need the drug, I felt things. Joy. Sadness. Connection. I started teaching meditation because I needed something to do with all the feeling."

Amara wrote: *Economic precarity → drug dependence → emotional numbing. Removal of precarity → space for withdrawal → emotional recovery. Drug use as symptom, not cause.*

"The corporate narrative," Amara said carefully, "suggests that removing work requirements leads to increased substance abuse. Your experience suggests the opposite?"

"Work created my substance abuse," Sarah said flatly. "The transfers let me quit both the job and the drug. I'm healthier now than I've been in a decade."

"Interesting." The word automatic. The fuck word. "Can you talk about what you do now? How you spend your time?"

"I teach meditation three times a week. I volunteer at the community garden. I'm learning to paint—badly, but learning. I visit my mother in Sector 9 monthly now that I can afford the transit. I read. I think. I exist without constantly calculating whether each moment is productive enough to justify taking up space."

There it was again. The same phrase Yuki had used. *Taking up space.* The internalized message that existence required justification.

"Do you plan to work again?" Amara asked. "In the traditional sense?"

Sarah considered this. "Maybe. If I found work that mattered. That helped people. But work for the sake of maintaining a prosperity score? Work to prove I deserve to exist? No. I'm done with that."

The interview lasted ninety minutes. When Sarah left, Amara sat with her notes and felt the weight of what she was documenting. This wasn't just economic data. It was proof that the entire system was built on unnecessary suffering. That the gun of starvation wasn't maintaining order—it was creating pathology.

Interview #28: Chen Rodriguez, early thirties, former overnight cargo processor. He arrived ten minutes late, apologetic.

"Sorry, sorry—I was helping Mrs. Okafor move furniture and lost track of time."

"That's fine. What's Mrs. Okafor's situation?" Amara asked, already noting the mutual aid dynamic.

"She's seventy-two, lives alone, her back's bad. Needed her bed moved to the other side of the room for better light. Used to be nobody had time to help. Now we have time."

Amara added this to her growing documentation of community cooperation. "Can you tell me what your life was like before the transfers?"

Chen laughed, sharp and slightly unhinged. "I worked overnight cargo processing. Six nights a week, 22:00 to 06:00. Came home, slept four hours, worked a day job sorting recyclables. Slept another two hours, worked delivering food. Made 2,100 credits a month. Spent 1,800 on rent and food. The rest went to keeping my prosperity score from dropping."

"And your health?"

"Terrible. Chronic exhaustion. Heart palpitations. Stress headaches. Probably heading for a heart attack by forty. But what was I supposed to do? Stop working? Then I'd have no income, prosperity score would crash, I'd end up in the slums or labor reassignment."

"What changed when you got the money?"

"I quit," Chen said simply. "Quit all of it. Slept for three days straight. Then I was terrified because what was I supposed to do without work? Who was I?"

"And what did you discover?"

"That I like helping people. I started fixing things around the building—doors that stuck, lights that flickered, stuff maintenance never bothered with. Then people started asking for help with other things. Moving furniture. Installing shelves. Teaching them basic repair. And I realized that's work too. Just not wage work. Not exploitation work. It's contribution. Community. The thing they always said work was supposed to be but never actually was."

Amara captured this verbatim. The distinction between wage labor and contribution. Between work as coercion and work as voluntary participation in community.

"Do you think the transfers should continue?" she asked.

Chen looked at her directly. "I think people shouldn't have to choose between poverty and exploitation. I think the transfers prove we're not lazy—we're exhausted. And I think whoever's sending the money understands something corporate never will: people are good when you let them be. We want to contribute. We want to help each other. We just can't when we're drowning."

Interview #31: Reed Salazar.

Amara had been watching him for three weeks. The thin man in the corner of the community center, always observing, always taking notes. People bought things from him discreetly—she suspected drug dealing but hadn't confirmed. He never participated in activities, never spoke in community meetings, just watched with exhausted eyes that tracked everything.

Marcus had mentioned him once: "Reed's been here forever. Keeps to himself mostly. But he sees things clearly. The ones in the most pain usually do."

When Amara approached him about an interview, Reed looked at her for a long moment, expression unreadable.

"Why would you want to interview me?" he asked flatly. "I'm not a success story. I'm still using. Still dealing. Still probably dying slowly."

"Everyone's experience is relevant," Amara said. "Not just the transformations. I want to understand the full picture."

Reed smiled slightly, bitter. "The full picture is that UBI doesn't save everyone. Some of us are too damaged."

But he agreed to the interview.

He arrived exactly on time, sat in the chair like he was ready to bolt, answered questions in deadpan monosyllables until Amara shifted approach.

"Do you think the experiment is working?" she asked.

Reed's expression changed. Something cracked open. "You want my honest assessment?"

"Always."

"It's working better than it should," Reed said. "People aren't just surviving—they're thriving. Building community. Discovering themselves. The corporate narrative about laziness and moral decline is bullshit. Complete bullshit. Give people security and they bloom. Every single person I've—" He stopped. Laughed inappropriately. "Every single person I've observed. They bloom."

Amara noted the slip. *Every single person I've—* What? Watched? Given money to?

"You've been documenting this too," she said carefully. Not a question.

Reed went still. "What makes you think that?"

"You're always here. Always watching. Always taking notes. That's not dealer behavior. That's researcher behavior."

"Maybe I'm just paranoid."

"Maybe you care more than you pretend to."

Reed looked at her for a long moment. Then: "If you publish research showing this works, showing corporate is lying about Sector 12, what do you think happens?"

"I don't know."

"They'll destroy your career," Reed said flatly. "Discredit your research. Pull your funding. Tank your prosperity score. Make an example of you. Because you're not just contradicting their narrative—you're proving their entire economic model is built on unnecessary cruelty."

"You seem certain of this."

"I've watched them kill people who threatened them. In ways that look like natural selection. Labor reassignment. Prosperity score adjustments. Cutting healthcare access. They're very good at making murder look like individual failure."

Amara felt ice down her spine. "Are you speaking from personal experience?"

Reed's expression closed again. "Interview's over."

He stood. Started to leave. Stopped.

"Your data is good," he said without turning around. "Whatever you do with it, make sure it survives. Even if you don't."

Then he was gone.

Amara sat in silence. Replayed the interview in her mind. Reed's slip about observing everyone. His detailed knowledge of community transformation. His certainty about corporate retaliation.

His warning.

She pulled up her files. Started a new document titled: *Anomalous observations—possible benefactor.*

Started noting everything she'd observed about Reed Salazar.

By week four, Amara had interviewed thirty-eight residents. The patterns were overwhelming:

**Positive outcomes:**
- 84% reported improved mental health
- 91% reported improved physical health
- 73% quit at least one exploitative job
- 68% increased community engagement
- 89% reported greater life satisfaction
- Crime down 67%
- Emergency healthcare down 52%
- Child welfare indicators up across all metrics

**Negative outcomes:**
- Labor force participation down 47%
- Corporate productivity metrics down 38%
- Traditional prosperity score advancement down 51%

The negative outcomes were only negative if you valued corporate productivity over human wellbeing. If you believed people existed to serve the economy rather than the economy existing to serve people.

Amara sat with her complete dataset and understood that publishing it honestly would end her career.

Her department was corporate-funded. The Board wanted evidence that UBI failed. Her advisor had already warned her about being "too political" in her research. Her student loans required steady employment. Her prosperity score couldn't handle unemployment.

She could write a version of the research that emphasized the labor participation decline. Could frame it as social pathology rather than liberation. Could give corporate the narrative they wanted.

She'd keep her job. Keep her score. Keep climbing away from poverty.

Or she could tell the truth.

Could document that every negative outcome was only negative from corporate's perspective. Could prove that people thrived when given security. Could use her position to fight instead of observe.

And lose everything she'd spent twelve years building.

Amara opened a new document. Started writing:

*Title: "Liberation or Collapse? A Natural Experiment in Universal Basic Income in Nova Station Sector 12"*

*Abstract: This study examines the social, economic, and health outcomes in a population receiving anonymous unconditional cash transfers over eight months. Contrary to prevailing assumptions about work requirements and moral hazard, findings demonstrate...*

She stopped. Deleted "Contrary to prevailing assumptions."

Started again:

*Abstract: This study examines the social, economic, and health outcomes in a population receiving anonymous unconditional cash transfers over eight months. Findings demonstrate significant improvements in mental health (+84%), physical health (+91%), community cohesion (+423%), and reduction in crime (-67%) and emergency healthcare utilization (-52%). Labor force participation declined 47%, while volunteer participation increased 312%. Results suggest...*

What did results suggest? That the entire economic system was built on coercion? That corporate had been lying about human nature for centuries? That people deserved security without strings?

All of which was true.

All of which would get her destroyed.

Amara saved the file. Closed her laptop. Sat in the dark community center surrounded by evidence of human flourishing.

Thought about whether she'd always be someone who documented suffering from a safe distance, or if she could finally be someone who used her power to fight.

The question felt unbearably heavy.

She didn't have an answer yet.

But she had the data.

And the data was undeniable.

And somewhere in Sector 12, someone—maybe Reed, maybe someone else—was running an experiment that proved the system wrong.

Amara just had to decide if she was brave enough to say so.

Out loud.

On the record.

Where everyone could see.
