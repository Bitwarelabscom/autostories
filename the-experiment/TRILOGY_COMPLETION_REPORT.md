## Thematic Completion

### Core Questions ANSWERED in Tentpoles:

1. **"Are people inherently lazy or systemically exhausted?"**
   - ANSWER (Ch 52, 60): Systemically exhausted. When given security, people thrived, organized, created.

2. **"What is the relationship between labor and worth?"**
   - ANSWER (Ch 46, 60): Worth is inherent. Labor should be owned by workers, not extractive.

3. **"Can one person prove a system wrong?"**
   - ANSWER (Ch 56, 60): Yes—but sustaining change requires collective action beyond the catalyst.

4. **"Difference between charity and structural change?"**
   - ANSWER (Ch 46, 52): Charity (UBI) was temporary. Structural change (cooperatives) sustained.

5. **"If people had security, what could they become?"**
   - ANSWER (Ch 60): Everything. Artists, teachers, organizers, whole humans. Reed died finding this answer.

## Bridge Chapter Strategy

### The 30 Remaining Chapters (Outlined, Not Written)

  - Collective planning sessions
  - Criminal investigation pressure

- **Ch 47-51 (5 chapters):** Between "Seeding Cooperatives" and "The UBI Ends"

  - Movement spreading to new sectors
  - Corporate negotiation attempts

- **Ch 53-55 (3 chapters):** Between "The UBI Ends" and "Final Project"
  - Complete dataset analysis
  - Harris's crisis seeing the data
  - Reed's body rapidly failing
  - Community sustaining without UBI

Each bridge chapter would:
