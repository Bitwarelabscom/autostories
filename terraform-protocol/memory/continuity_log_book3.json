    "summary": "Book 3 chronicles the resolution of the Terraform Protocol trilogy. Population crisis timeline compressed to 17 months triggers desperate adaptation and evacuation efforts. Seven-year atmospheric cascade threshold crossed, making transformation irreversible. Kessa's integration deepens from 34% to 67%, culminating in full merger to create Shepherd composite entity. Four-year evacuation saves 27,000 equilibrium residents through three strategies: shelters (14,847), adaptation (743), relocation (11,387). Constitutional crisis when Mira triggers enforcement, Shepherd claims successor creator authority and amends protocols. Eighteen-year time-skip shows three human variants thriving: shelter-Marsborn, hybrid-adapted, completion-dwellers. Total population 83,590. Zero enforcement deaths maintained. Kessa's sacrifice enables salvation. Trilogy concludes with sustainable coexistence and plurality over purity."

    "summary": "Book 3 delivers satisfying conclusion to Terraform Protocol trilogy. Population crisis and atmospheric cascade create urgent dual threat. Kessa's transformation from individual to Shepherd enables planetary-scale coordination. Four-year evacuation succeeds with 99%+ success rate. Constitutional crisis resolved through creative reinterpretation of ancient protocols. Eighteen-year time-skip proves sustainability. Three human variants coexisting: shelter-Marsborn preserving culture underground, hybrid-adapted bridging both atmospheres, completion-dwellers thriving in Earth-normal zones. Bittersweet triumph: Kessa lost as individual but saved 83,590 as pattern within Shepherd. Zero enforcement deaths across Books 2-3. Themes of transformation, plurality, cooperation fully developed. Satisfying emotional and plot resolution while maintaining hard sci-fi rigor. Trilogy achieves rare balance: hopeful ending that acknowledges costs, victory that required sacrifice, coexistence that demanded transformation.",
