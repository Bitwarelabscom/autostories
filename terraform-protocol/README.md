# Terraform Protocol

A planetary romance trilogy about humanity's attempt to terraform Mars revealing ancient alien warnings we're too arrogant to heed.

## Trilogy Structure

- **Book 1: Red Soil Rising** - First contact buried in stone
- **Book 2: The Architects' Warning** - Catastrophic misunderstanding
- **Book 3: Two Worlds Burning** - Sacrifice and coexistence

## Setting

Mars, 2240-2260. Humanity is six years into terraforming the red planet when xenoarchaeologist Kessa Okafor discovers an alien megastructure beneath Olympus Mons. The structure isn't dormant - it's been managing Mars' atmosphere for two million years. And it views human terraforming as a threat.

## Core Themes

1. **Hubris of terraforming vs. adapting ourselves** - Do we have the right to remake worlds to suit us?
2. **Parent civilization (Earth) vs. child civilization (Mars)** - When does a colony become independent?
3. **Understanding the alien vs. making it human** - Must we make everything familiar, or can we learn to coexist with difference?

## Getting Started

Follow the novel generation system workflow from `/project/claude.md`:

### Phase 1: Foundation
1. Review `world/world_state.json` - world rules and setting
2. Create character files in `characters/` directory
3. Build story graph in `plot/story_graph.json`

### Phase 2-4: Follow standard workflow

## World Rules (Immutable)

- Terraforming nanites create psychoactive compounds affecting 12% of population
- Ancient alien structure ("The Gardener") responds to human neural patterns
- Terraforming becomes irreversible after 7-year threshold (currently at year 6 in Book 1)
- Earth's climate is past repair - Mars is humanity's only viable option
- No FTL travel or communication (20-minute light delay to Earth)

## Technology Level

- Fusion drives for orbital transport
- Genetic adaptation for low-gravity/thin-atmosphere tolerance
- Nanite-based atmospheric conversion
- Beginning to interface with alien technology
- Realistic hard sci-fi constraints

## Tone

Creeping dread beneath colonial optimism. The beauty of Mars landscape contrasts with the wrongness of the changes humanity is making. Intimate character moments play against vast planetary-scale horror as humans slowly realize they're the invasive species.

## Unique Element

This is "first contact" where the aliens are long dead, but their technology still functions. The AI they left behind must judge whether humanity can coexist with a living world, or will always seek to remake it in their image.
