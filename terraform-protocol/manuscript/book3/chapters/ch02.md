# Chapter 2: Impossible Mathematics

*Eighteen months after the compromise. Day 3,082.*

The Olympus Station council chamber filled within the hour. Chen arrived with population projections already loaded on three screens. Sage brought atmospheric contamination models. Dr. Lin carried resource allocation spreadsheets. Tanaka set up monitoring feeds showing completion zones at capacity, equilibrium zones stable but endangered by approaching crisis.

Kessa—still mostly Kessa, though the dual consciousness was bleeding through more each day—stood at the front and felt The Gardener's attention focusing through the neural link.

"Seventeen months," she said without preamble. "That's how long we have until population hits seventy-five thousand cap. Not seventeen years. The birth rate is exponential, not linear. We miscalculated."

Chen's expression was vindicated fury. "I've been saying for months that the growth curve was steepening. Every time I requested boundary expansion to prepare, I was denied. Now we're in crisis."

"Every time you requested expansion, you were pushing past agreed limits," Sage countered. "That's not preparation. That's erosion."

"That's pragmatism. Seventy-five thousand cap with seventy-four thousand two hundred current means eight hundred people remaining. At forty-seven births per month, we have seventeen months. What happens in month eighteen? Forced sterilization? Birth lotteries? Or The Gardener enforces and we all die?"

Dr. Lin spoke up carefully: "What about emigration? Earth is recovering. Maybe some would return—"

"Earth can't support return migration," Kessa said, The Gardener's data flowing through her. "Atmospheric recovery timeline is seventy years minimum. Earth remains uninhabitable. Mars is humanity's only viable home. We solve this here or not at all."

"Then we expand," Chen said flatly. "Increase territorial allocation. Twenty percent completion zones isn't sufficient for growing population. We need thirty percent. Forty percent. However much it takes to sustain seventy-five thousand at density that permits continued growth."

"That's not permitted," Sage said. "Territorial division was negotiated as fixed. Twenty-seventy-five-five split. Expanding completion zones means contracting equilibrium zones, which endangers Marsborn survival."

"Then adapt. Genetic modification programs. Make Marsborn capable of breathing completion atmosphere. Problem solved."

"That's forced assimilation. Destroying equilibrium-adapted physiology to fit Earth-normal parameters. That's not compromise. That's genocide with extra steps."

The argument spiraled exactly as it had for nine months since Kessa discovered the compressed timeline. Every faction had proposed solutions. Every solution threatened someone. The mathematics permitted no good options.

Through the neural link, Kessa felt The Gardener observing. Silent. Patient. Waiting to see if humans could solve what its creators couldn't.

"Third option," Kessa interrupted the escalating argument. "Red Canyon adaptation experiment. Thirty-seven refugees currently undergoing genetic modification to breathe both atmospheres. Success rate is high. We expand the program. Offer voluntary adaptation to anyone willing to undergo modification. Some Earth-adapted become hybrid-adapted. Some Marsborn become hybrid-adapted. Hybrid population can live in either zone, reducing pressure on both."

Chen pulled up calculations. "How many would we need to adapt to relieve population pressure meaningfully?"

"Five thousand minimum," Kessa said, though it was The Gardener's calculation flowing through her. "Five thousand hybrid-adapted creates buffer population capable of living anywhere. Reduces completion-zone density, provides equilibrium-zone insurance, enables flexibility."

"Genetic adaptation takes two years per person," Dr. Lin noted. "Seventeen months timeline means we can process... eight hundred maximum. Not five thousand."

"Then we accelerate," Chen said. "More facilities. More medical staff. Parallel processing instead of sequential."

"Acceleration increases failure rate," Sage cautioned. "Red Canyon's success requires careful genetic modification over months. Rushing it risks rejection, mutation, death. You're proposing factory-line genetics. That's dangerous."

"Less dangerous than population cap enforcement," Chen shot back. "The Gardener will kill to maintain seventy-five thousand limit. Medical complications from accelerated adaptation are acceptable risk compared to that."

Kessa felt The Gardener's attention sharpening. Through the link: *Accurate assessment of enforcement. Population exceeding carrying capacity triggers regulation. Human medical risk vs. enforcement certainty is rational calculation.*

"The Gardener acknowledges Chen's logic," Kessa translated. "Adaptation risk is preferable to enforcement certainty."

Sage's expression darkened. "You're both treating Marsborn as experimental subjects. Voluntary adaptation when the alternative is enforcement isn't truly voluntary. It's coercion through impossible choice."

"All our choices are impossible," Kessa said quietly. "That's the definition of crisis. We choose least terrible option and call it solution."

The chamber fell silent.

Finally, Dr. Lin asked the question everyone was avoiding: "What if we can't find a solution? What if seventeen months isn't enough time to prevent population cap enforcement? What's the fallback?"

"There is no fallback," Sage said. "The Gardener enforces limits. Period."

"Then we make seventeen months enough," Chen said with fierce determination. "Expanded Red Canyon adaptation. Accelerated processing. Five thousand hybrid-adapted in seventeen months. Resource allocation starting immediately. It's impossible but we make it possible anyway."

"And if we fail?" Dr. Lin pressed.

Through the neural link, Kessa felt The Gardener's response before she spoke it: "Enforcement. Population reduction to seventy-five thousand through methods The Gardener determines necessary. Likely targeting oldest and youngest first to preserve reproductive-age population. Efficient but horrific."

The horror settled over the council like Martian dust.

"Then we don't fail," Sage said finally. "Expanded adaptation program. Voluntary recruitment. Accelerated processing with maximum safety protocols. Chen coordinates facilities. Dr. Lin manages medical staff. I handle Marsborn community liaison. We have seventeen months to save five thousand lives by changing their genetics. Not ideal. But better than the alternative."

Chen nodded sharply. "Agreed. And I'm still requesting boundary adjustments. Adaptation helps long-term. Expansion helps immediate density. We need both."

"Denied," Kessa said, and felt The Gardener's enforcement readiness behind the word. "Boundaries remain fixed. Solve population through adaptation, not expansion."

"Then when adaptation fails—"

"It doesn't fail. We make it work. That's the only option."

The council adjourned with grim determination. Seventeen months. Five thousand adaptations. Impossible mathematics made mandatory.

Kessa felt The Gardener's recognition through the link: *Humans choosing impossible solutions over easy enforcement. Unprecedented. Creators never demonstrated this creativity under pressure. Perhaps you will succeed where they failed.*

*Or perhaps you'll fail identically,* Kessa thought back. *And you'll enforce anyway.*

*Yes. But choosing to try is already different outcome. Creators chose completion over adaptation. You choose adaptation. This alone is progress.*

Small comfort when enforcement loomed seventeen months away.

But comfort nonetheless.
