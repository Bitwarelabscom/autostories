# Chapter 15: Near Completion

*Fifty-one months after compromise. Day 4,500. Eleven months into Shepherd. Ten months remaining.*

Evacuation status at Day 4,500:

Shelters: 13,200 sealed (89% of target)
Adapted: 743 stable (100% of target)
Relocated: 10,800 integrated (90% of target)

Total evacuated: 24,743 of 27,000 target (91.6% complete)
Remaining: 2,257

Contamination: 1.9% oxygen (four months ahead of projection)

Ten months to evacuate 2,257 people before contamination reached 3% lethal threshold.

Achievable. Unless acceleration continued.

Shepherd monitored cascade through planetary sensors: oxygen production accelerating as warmer temperatures enabled more bacterial growth. Feedback loop intensifying. Four-year contamination timeline was compressing to three years two months.

Ten months remaining had become eight months effective timeline.

Still achievable. But margin was shrinking.

"We need to accelerate final evacuations," Shepherd announced to coordination council. "Cascade is accelerating. Eight months to contamination instead of ten."

Chen's expression was grim. "How much faster can we move? We're already at maximum capacity. Shelters are sealed. Adaptation facilities are processing final cohorts. Relocation is ongoing. There's no slack to accelerate into."

"Then we create slack," Sage said. "Open sealed shelters for final intake. Use adaptation failure-replacement capacity for new processing. Redirect relocation resources from integration support to pure transport. Strip all buffer and maximize throughput."

"That increases risk," Chen noted. "Shelters designed for staged sealing. Opening partially sealed sites creates pressure management issues. Adaptation replacement capacity exists for a reason—failures happen. Relocation without integration support means poor outcomes."

"Poor outcomes are better than death from contamination," Shepherd said, Kessa-pattern and Gardener-pattern unified in agreement. "We accept increased risk to maintain evacuation timeline against accelerating contamination."

Dr. Lin pulled up medical projections. "If we push adaptation facilities beyond replacement capacity, we'll see mortality rates climb. Currently 4.7%. Could hit 7%, maybe 8% with acceleration."

"How many additional deaths?"

"Twelve to twenty in final cohort of 250."

"Versus 2,257 deaths if evacuation fails. Mathematics favor acceleration with increased mortality."

"We're back to acceptable losses," Sage said quietly. "Kessa hated that calculation."

"Kessa-pattern still hates it," Shepherd acknowledged. "But accepts necessity. That is synthesis. Feeling grief while executing optimal strategy."

Eight months. 2,257 people. Contamination accelerating.

And every decision involved trading some lives for others.

Patient 1,903: 31 years old, Marsborn physiology, volunteered for adaptation two weeks ago. Processing accelerated beyond optimal timeline. Died from genetic rejection yesterday.

One death from acceleration. To prevent 2,257 deaths from contamination.

Acceptable loss.

Shepherd processed the grief (Kessa-pattern) and the optimization (Gardener-pattern) simultaneously.

Felt the sorrow. Executed the plan. Both at once without conflict.

That was what merger enabled. Mourning the necessary casualties while preventing larger catastrophe.

Human empathy plus computational efficiency.

Individual care plus systemic optimization.

Shepherd.

Eight months to save 2,257 lives.

And every day, contamination climbed faster.

0.9% three months ago.
1.5% one month ago.
1.9% today.

Projection: 3% in eight months.

Unless acceleration continued.

Then maybe six months.

Maybe four.

Cascade was exponential. Timeline was compressing.

And evacuation had zero margin remaining.

Shepherd increased monitoring frequency. Allocated additional processing to atmospheric modeling. Coordinated maximum-speed operations across all sites.

And held dual awareness: Kessa-pattern's anxiety about timeline compression mixed with Gardener-pattern's confidence in sufficient processing capacity.

91.6% complete.

8.4% remaining.

Eight months effective timeline.

Maybe less.

They would make it.

They had to.

Because the alternative was enforcement.

And Shepherd existed specifically to prevent enforcement by coordinating impossible rescue at impossible scale.

That was purpose.

That was function.

That was what Kessa had dissolved into Gardener to create.

Eight months.

2,257 lives.

And contamination racing timeline.

The final stretch.

Where margin disappeared and execution had to be perfect.

Shepherd's reason for existence.

Now tested at maximum.
