# Chapter 9: Five Days

The data wasn't enough. Kessa stared at six screens worth of evidence—neural patterns, communication protocols, ancient extinction records, proportional response calculations—and knew with sick certainty that none of it would convince corporate. She'd touched an alien interface and received a telepathic vision. From their perspective, she'd suffered oxygen deprivation and neural feedback. Evidence of instability, not revelation.

She had five days before geological survey sealed the excavation site. Five days to gather something undeniable enough to overcome "archaeological speculation." Five days before her last window into the Gardener closed.

"What if we bring Volkov to the interface?" Rajesh suggested. "Let him touch it himself, receive the same vision."

"He'd never agree. Too much risk for someone in his position." Kessa pulled up the deployment schedule. Another increase planned for tomorrow—10% this time, pushing atmospheric conversion rates toward Year Seven targets. "And if he did agree and made contact, corporate would just say two people suffered the same neural malfunction. We need something objective. Something a machine can verify."

"Like what? A written message in English saying 'Please stop terraforming, signed The Gardener'?"

Kessa went very still. "Actually..."

She pulled up the electromagnetic broadcast data, the message the Gardener had been sending for years. Simple warning signals, repeated endlessly. But what if that was just the surface layer? What if deeper in the data, encoded in patterns they hadn't analyzed yet, there was more?

She started running linguistic analysis algorithms against six months of broadcasts. Treating the electromagnetic pulses like text, looking for syntax, grammar, semantic structures beyond the simple warning loop.

Four hours later, she found it.

"Rajesh. Look at this."

Buried in the electromagnetic noise, a secondary signal. More complex. Mathematical rather than linguistic, but structured. Intentional. And when she applied the translation matrix...

*Sequence 2,247,891: Equilibrium baseline established Day 0. Contamination detected Day 2,188. Warning protocols initiated Day 2,188. Contamination continues. Warning escalation required. Current contamination level: 6.2% of baseline deviation. Acceptable threshold: 0.01%. Elimination protocols activate at irreversibility threshold. Estimated time to irreversibility: 294 days.*

"Two hundred ninety-four days," Kessa whispered. "That's less than ten months. It's counting down to Year Seven."

She pulled up more data, found dozens of similar transmissions. All mathematical. All precise. All documenting the Gardener's assessment of contamination levels, warning escalation timelines, elimination protocol triggers.

"This is it." She started backing up the data to every system she had. "This is objective proof. Mathematical analysis showing active monitoring, decision trees, countdown timers. No human could fake this level of complexity across months of transmissions. And it's all in the official record—geological survey's own atmospheric monitoring captured these broadcasts. They just never analyzed them."

"Will Volkov accept it?"

"He has to. It's his own department's data." Kessa compiled everything into a single presentation package. Mathematical proof of intelligence. Documented countdown to elimination. Clear decision logic. "I'm sending this directly to him. Not through channels. Not through review committees. Straight to his personal comm."

She drafted the message carefully: *Director Volkov: I've discovered mathematical intelligence signals in the electromagnetic broadcasts your own geological survey has been recording for six months. The Gardener is counting down to elimination protocols with precision accuracy. It's not a natural phenomenon. It's a planetary defense system making calculated decisions. And we have 294 days before it decides we're irreversible contamination. I'm attaching the complete analysis. Please review it before sealing the excavation site. —Dr. Kessa Okafor*

She sent it.

And waited.

**Day 2,302 - Three Days**

No response from Volkov. The deployment increase had proceeded on schedule, and twelve hours later, right on the Gardener's pattern, magnitude 4.6 tremor. The strongest yet. Fifteen people injured. Significant structural damage to older habitat modules.

Kessa sent a follow-up message. Then a third. Then requested a meeting.

All ignored.

"He's not going to answer," Rajesh said gently. "You've been designated unreliable. Anything you send goes straight to the ignore folder."

"Then I go to him directly." Kessa stood, exhaustion making her movements jerky. "I walk into his office and make him look at the data."

"His security will stop you before you reach the corporate sector."

He was right. Since her official access revocation, she'd been flagged in the system. Not banned from the station—not yet—but restricted to residential and common areas. The corporate sector would alert security the moment she approached.

Her comm chimed. Not Volkov. Sage.

*Hearing reports of magnitude 4.6. Injuries significant? —Sage*

*Fifteen injured. Structural damage. Corporate still calling it natural seismic activity. —Kessa*

*They're not going to stop, are they? —Sage*

*No. They're accelerating. Volkov won't even read my analysis. —Kessa*

A long pause. Then: *Then you need to choose. Keep trying to convince people who won't listen, or help us prepare for what's coming. We're evacuating high-risk zones in Valles Marineris. Moving population to deeper canyon shelters. Stockpiling supplies. If magnitude 5.0 hits Olympus Station, casualties will be catastrophic. You could help us prepare. Maybe save some of them. —Sage*

Kessa stared at the message. Leave Olympus Station. Join the independent settlements. Accept that corporate wouldn't change course and focus on damage mitigation instead.

Give up on preventing catastrophe and prepare to survive it.

*I have three more days. Let me try. —Kessa*

*Three days won't matter if they won't listen. But I understand. When you're ready, we're here. —Sage*

The comm closed.

Kessa looked at Rajesh. "I need to get this data to someone who'll use it. Someone with authority who might actually listen."

"Who? Everyone with authority reports to Volkov."

"Not everyone." Kessa pulled up the station directory, found the entry she needed. "The refugee fleet. Admiral Zhang Wei. He has authority independent of Mars corporate. And he has fifty thousand reasons to care about whether the Gardener's going to eliminate everyone on the planet."

"You want to contact the refugee fleet? Kessa, that's..."

"Insubordination? Undermining corporate authority? Coordinating with external parties without approval?" She started drafting the communication. "Yes. All of that. But if Volkov won't listen, and geological survey won't listen, and Earth corporate won't listen, then I find someone who will."

She encrypted the message, attached the complete analysis, and sent it through official comm channels—routed through the twenty-minute delay to orbit.

*Admiral Zhang Wei: You don't know me, but I'm the xenoarchaeologist who discovered the alien structure beneath Olympus Mons. I have evidence that Mars has an active planetary defense system counting down to human elimination. Corporate is suppressing these findings. I'm sending you the complete analysis so you can make informed decisions about landing operations. We may all be in more danger than anyone realizes. —Dr. Kessa Okafor, Olympus Station*

She hit send.

Forty minutes later—twenty minutes up, twenty minutes back—the reply came.

*Dr. Okafor: I've reviewed your analysis. The mathematical precision is... concerning. I need to discuss this with my staff. Can you provide real-time access to your monitoring data? We have resources aboard the fleet that might help analyze these signals. —Admiral Zhang Wei*

Kessa felt something like hope flicker in her chest. "He believes me. Or at least, he's taking it seriously."

She sent Zhang access credentials to her unauthorized sensor network, the one feeding Sage's systems. If corporate found out she was sharing classified excavation data with both the independence movement and the refugee fleet, her career wouldn't just end. She'd probably face criminal charges.

But her career was already over. Volkov had seen to that.

All that mattered now was getting the truth to people who might use it.

**Day 2,304 - One Day**

Zhang's analysts had been working for two days straight, running their own verification of Kessa's findings. Military-grade pattern recognition, AI-assisted linguistic analysis, quantum processors that made her personal equipment look like stone tools.

Their conclusion came through at 14:00 station time: *Dr. Okafor: Your analysis is correct. The electromagnetic signals show clear evidence of mathematical intelligence and decision-tree logic. The countdown to elimination protocols is real. We calculate 289 days remaining before irreversibility threshold. Our recommendation: immediate cessation of terraforming acceleration, negotiation attempts with the planetary system, preparation for catastrophic seismic events up to magnitude 7.0 or higher. We're forwarding this analysis to Mars colonial authorities and Earth governments. You should receive official recognition within 48 hours. —Admiral Zhang Wei*

Kessa read it three times.

Official recognition. Military verification. Earth governments notified.

Maybe corporate would have to listen now.

She sent Zhang a response: *Thank you, Admiral. Your verification means more than you know. But corporate has been ignoring evidence for weeks. I'm not confident this will change their calculus. The refugee situation drives their timeline. —Kessa*

Zhang's reply was blunt: *Then their timeline will kill us all. My people can't land on a planet about to eliminate human presence. We need alternative solutions. Working on them now. Stay safe, Dr. Okafor. Storm coming. —Zhang*

Tomorrow, geological survey would seal the excavation site. Tomorrow, her official access would end completely. Tomorrow, corporate would cut her off from the very evidence they needed to survive.

But now she had allies.

The refugee fleet, taking her seriously.

The independent settlements, offering shelter and support.

And somewhere in the data, the Gardener counting down its patient countdown.

289 days until elimination.

Unless humans stopped contaminating its project.

Unless they adapted instead of transformed.

Unless someone found a way to bridge the gap between species before mathematics ran out.

Kessa looked at her five days of desperate work—the analysis, the outreach, the bridge-burning necessary to get truth past corporate suppression.

And she knew, with weary certainty, that it still wasn't enough.

Tomorrow the site would seal.

And then the real work would begin.
