# Chapter 5: Committee Decisions

The executive conference room occupied prime real estate in Olympus Station's corporate sector—reinforced windows overlooking the Martian landscape, Earth-imported furniture that cost more than Kessa's annual salary, air filtration that actually worked. Five people sat around the obsidian table, their faces reflecting the cold light of data screens.

Dmitri Volkov at the head. Dr. Yuki Tanaka from geological survey. Marcus Reeves representing Earth corporate interests via twenty-minute-delayed video feed. Dr. Chen, looking uncomfortable in formal attire. And Kessa, who'd been awake for twenty-three hours and felt every minute of it.

"Thank you for joining us, Dr. Okafor." Volkov's tone carried professional courtesy that didn't quite reach his eyes. "We've completed our comprehensive review of your excavation findings. Dr. Tanaka, if you would?"

Yuki stood, pulled up the geological survey's analysis on the main display. "Our team has examined all seismic data, structural surveys, and atmospheric readings from the Olympus Mons excavation site. Our findings are as follows: seismic activity correlates with known volcanic adjustment patterns in the Tharsis region. The crystalline structures, while unusual, show no definitive evidence of computational function. Atmospheric anomalies fall within normal variation ranges for a planet undergoing active terraforming."

Kessa felt her stomach drop. "That's not what the data shows."

"Dr. Okafor." Volkov's voice carried warning. "You'll have opportunity to respond."

Yuki continued, clicking through graphs that bore only superficial resemblance to Kessa's findings. "The tunnel networks beneath Olympus Mons are extensive, yes. But Mars is geologically active. Lava tubes and natural cavern systems are well-documented throughout the Tharsis region. The presence of unusual mineral formations doesn't constitute proof of alien engineering."

"We found atmospheric processing equipment," Kessa said. "Active systems maintaining distinct environmental conditions."

"You found chambers with different atmospheric compositions," Yuki corrected. "Which could be explained by sealed pockets of ancient Martian atmosphere, preserved by crystalline structures acting as natural barriers." She pulled up a new slide. "Dr. Okafor, your work on the Jezero artifacts was groundbreaking. No one disputes your expertise in xenoarchaeology. But this excavation requires geological and atmospheric expertise to properly interpret the findings."

The implication hung in the air: stay in your lane.

"The seismic responses," Kessa tried again. "The patterns—"

"Are consistent with tectonic adjustment," Yuki said firmly. "Mars has a partially molten core. Olympus Mons, while dormant, sits atop a magma chamber. As terraforming alters atmospheric pressure and surface temperature, we expect increased seismic activity. The patterns you've identified could easily be confirmation bias."

Kessa opened her mouth. Closed it. Looked at Chen, who wouldn't meet her eyes.

Volkov leaned forward. "Dr. Okafor, I respect your passion. But we cannot halt a seventy-year terraforming project based on speculation. The review committee's consensus is clear: continue excavation with standard safety protocols, document findings thoroughly, but maintain current terraforming timeline. No delays."

"There's a planetary defense system activating beneath us," Kessa said, hearing desperation creep into her voice. "I've mapped networks spanning continent-scale distances. I've documented escalating responses that correlate directly with terraforming activity. I've found proof that Mars was successfully terraformed before by a civilization that built maintenance systems that still function two million years later—"

"Proof?" Marcus Reeves' face, delayed by light-minutes from Earth, finally spoke from the screen. His expression carried the particular dismissiveness of someone who'd already made up their mind. "Dr. Okafor, I've reviewed your evidence package. What I see is interesting archaeology. Ancient structures, yes. Unusual geological formations, certainly. But active alien AI responding to our terraforming? That's extraordinary speculation requiring extraordinary proof."

"The atmospheric processing—"

"Could be automated systems degrading over millions of years. Chemical reactions in sealed environments. Geothermal venting creating pressure differentials." Reeves gestured dismissively. "There are a dozen mundane explanations before we reach 'functioning alien megastructure.'"

"I visited Valles Marineris yesterday," Kessa said, changing tactics. "The Marsborn have been monitoring these patterns for three years. They call it the Gardener. They've documented the same atmospheric changes, the same escalation in response to terraforming—"

"The independence movement." Volkov's voice went cold. "Dr. Okafor, are you coordinating with separatist elements?"

The question landed like an accusation. "I'm gathering corroborating data from sources who've been living on Mars longer than corporate has been paying attention."

"You're listening to radicals who want to halt terraforming to preserve their political agenda." Reeves leaned toward his camera. "Dr. Okafor, we have fifty thousand refugees in orbit. Fifty thousand human lives depending on Mars becoming habitable. Whatever agenda the Marsborn are pushing, it doesn't change the mathematics of survival."

"The mathematics," Kessa said carefully, "also include the possibility that continuing terraforming will trigger a defensive response that kills everyone. Refugees and colonists alike."

"Based on speculation about an alien system that—according to our geological experts—is more likely natural cavern formations and tectonic activity." Volkov stood, signaling the meeting's end. "Dr. Okafor, you're a brilliant archaeologist. Please continue documenting the excavation. Your findings will be invaluable for understanding Mars' geological history. But operational decisions about terraforming will be made by qualified engineering and geological specialists, not archaeologists interpreting ancient ruins."

The dismissal was complete. Polite. Professional. Absolute.

Kessa looked around the table. Yuki wouldn't meet her eyes—following orders, protecting her position. Chen stared at the table, shoulders hunched. Reeves had already moved on to other business on his end of the connection. Volkov waited with that particular patience of someone who'd made his point and expected compliance.

"When the Gardener responds with something you can't explain away as tectonic adjustment," Kessa said quietly, "I hope you'll remember this meeting."

"Dr. Okafor." Volkov's voice carried genuine sympathy now, which somehow made it worse. "I understand your frustration. But Mars has been geologically active throughout the terraforming process. We've managed it successfully for six years. Whatever ancient structures you've found, they've been dormant for two million years. I doubt another ten months will wake them."

Kessa left the conference room without responding. She'd given them everything—data, analysis, corroborating evidence from independent sources. And they'd dismissed it all with the bureaucratic efficiency of people protecting a timeline more valuable than truth.

In the hallway, Rajesh waited. "How bad?"

"They're not going to stop." Kessa kept walking, needing movement to channel her rage. "Geological survey says it's all natural. Corporate says the Marsborn are political radicals. Earth says they need the refugees landed. Everyone has their reasons to ignore the evidence."

"So what do we do?"

"We document everything. When the Gardener escalates—and it will escalate—we'll have the evidence on record. Proof that we warned them." Kessa stopped, looked back at the conference room where comfortable men made comfortable decisions about planetary forces they didn't understand. "And we prepare for what comes next."

"Which is?"

"I don't know yet." She pulled up her comm, found Sage's contact information from yesterday's visit. "But I'm done trusting corporate to make the right choice. They've had their chance."

A message from Dr. Chen appeared on her display: *I'm sorry. I tried to back you up, but they cut my testimony. —Chen*

Kessa deleted it without responding. Chen had made her choice in that conference room, sitting silent while geological survey rewrote reality.

Her comm pinged with another seismic alert. Magnitude 3.8, centered beneath the excavation site. The sixth tremor this week. The strongest yet.

Escalating. Exactly as predicted.

Kessa pulled up the data, studied the pattern. The intervals between tremors were decreasing. The magnitudes were climbing. And if Sage's predictive model was correct, they had six months before the Gardener stopped warning and started eliminating.

Six months.

And corporate had just committed to maintaining the terraforming timeline for the next ten months.

The mathematics of that situation didn't require a geological degree to understand.

Kessa drafted a message to Sage: *Met with corporate. They're not stopping. Need to talk about alternatives. —Kessa*

She hesitated before sending. This crossed a line—coordinating with the independence movement, planning around corporate authority. Everything she'd worked for, her position at Olympus Station, her research access, all of it would vanish if Volkov learned she was actively undermining the terraforming timeline.

Another seismic ping. Magnitude 3.9, twelve hours after the last one.

Escalating.

Kessa sent the message.

Then she went back to her lab and started preparing for the day corporate's comfortable dismissals met planetary reality.

When that day came—and mathematics said it would come—she intended to have answers they hadn't wanted to hear.

Because the Gardener was patient.

But patience, Kessa was learning, wasn't the same as mercy.
