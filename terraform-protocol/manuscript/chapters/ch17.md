# Chapter 17: Olympus Falling

The first warning came thirty-seven minutes before Olympus Station died.

Kessa was in the geology lab when every seismic sensor on Mars screamed at once. Not the gradual buildup they'd learned to recognize. Not the escalating tremors that gave minutes or hours of warning. This was coordinated. Simultaneous. Every monitoring station within five hundred kilometers of Olympus Mons registering identical signatures.

"It's not possible." Dr. Martinez stared at the readings, face pale. "This pattern—this would require controlling seismic activity across the entire tectonic region simultaneously."

"It's possible," Kessa said quietly, "if you're a planet-wide intelligence that's spent two million years managing geological systems."

She pulled up the structure's power readings. The crystalline networks were lit like stars, energy flowing through pathways that spanned continents. The Gardener had been building to this for weeks—since Dmitri's contingency option had tried to collapse the central chamber with precisely targeted explosives. Since humanity had attempted to murder a planet's immune system and failed.

Now Mars was responding in kind.

"Evacuation," Kessa said, already moving. "Full evacuation of Olympus Station. Everyone to the transport ships. We have—" she checked the seismic calculations, "—maybe thirty minutes."

"On whose authority?" Martinez demanded.

"On the authority of someone who's watched this thing learn and adapt for five months. Move!"

But even as she ran for the comm station, Kessa knew thirty minutes wouldn't be enough. Olympus Station housed twenty-three hundred people. The transport ships could hold maybe a thousand. And Dmitri—Dmitri would never authorize full evacuation. Not when it meant admitting defeat. Not when his daughter's ship was three weeks out and the station was their designated landing site.

She keyed the emergency broadcast anyway. "This is Dr. Kessa Okafor. Seismic event imminent at Olympus Station. Critical threat level. All personnel evacuate to transport ships immediately. This is not a drill."

Dmitri's voice cut across the channel within seconds. "Dr. Okafor, you are not authorized to issue evacuation orders. Stand down."

"Dmitri, look at the readings. The Gardener is about to hit us with everything it has. We need to evacuate now."

"We've weathered earthquakes before. The station is rated to magnitude 7. Your panic serves no purpose except to create chaos." He sounded tired. Worn down by months of crisis management. "I have a supply convoy landing in six hours. I have your colleague Dr. Williams running atmospheric corrections in sector seven. I have three thousand things that need doing, and I cannot have you undermining confidence in station integrity."

"Confidence won't save them when—"

The floor lurched.

Not a tremor. A violent sideways jolt that threw Kessa against the console. Alarms shrieked. The lights flickered. Through the viewport, she saw the Martian surface ripple like water, impossible physics made real by alien technology.

Magnitude 7.2. Epicenter: directly beneath Olympus Station.

The habitat dome creaked. Somewhere in the station, people were screaming.

And then it got worse.

---

Dmitri Volkov felt the earthquake in his bones.

He was in the operations center when the first shock hit, surrounded by displays showing colony status, supply chains, atmospheric metrics, terraforming progress. Six years of work. His daughter's salvation three weeks away. Everything he'd sacrificed for, within reach.

The displays went dark.

Emergency lighting kicked in, painting the operations center blood-red. His team looked to him for orders, for leadership, for the confidence that they could engineer their way through this like they'd engineered their way through everything else.

Dmitri pulled up the structural integrity monitors and felt something in his chest go cold.

The habitat dome had fractures. Not small cracks—fissures meters wide, spreading as he watched. The pressure differential warnings were already sounding. They had minutes before the dome failed. Minutes before twenty-three hundred people started breathing vacuum.

"Seal all sectors," he ordered, voice steady despite the ice in his veins. "Emergency bulkheads. Evacuate outer rings to core habitats. Deploy pressure patches to dome fractures."

His team moved with trained efficiency. They were good people. They'd followed him to Mars, believed in his vision of a safe world, trusted his engineering solutions.

He'd led them to die.

"Dmitri." His second-in-command, Pavel, pointed at the seismic display. "Magnitude 7.9. Eight-point-one. Eight-point-three. Sir, it's still growing."

Magnitude 8.5. Largest earthquake in recorded Martian history.

The station groaned. Metal screamed. Somewhere in the eastern sector, Dmitri heard the explosive decompression of habitat breach—the sound of atmosphere fleeing into Mars' thin air, taking lives with it.

"Full evacuation," he said. Words that tasted like ash. Admission of failure. "All personnel to transport ships. Prioritize children and critical personnel."

"Sir, the transports can't hold everyone."

"I know."

Pavel met his eyes. Understanding passed between them. The arithmetic of catastrophe. The math that determined who lived and who didn't.

"Move," Dmitri said.

He watched his operations center empty, then turned back to the displays. Somewhere in the chaos, a part of him—the engineer, the problem-solver—was still calculating. Olympus Station was doomed. But the other colonies might be saved. If he could understand the attack pattern, if he could get data to the other settlements, if he could—

The western dome collapsed.

He watched it on the monitors—a flower of atmosphere blooming into vacuum, carrying with it hab modules, equipment, people. The residential sector where families lived. The medical center. The schools.

Dmitri thought of his daughter, three weeks out in the refugee fleet. Thought of the photo on his desk. Thought of the promise he'd made to her that Mars would be safe.

He'd been wrong about everything.

---

Kessa ran through corridors that buckled and heaved beneath her feet.

She'd grabbed as many people as she could from the geology wing—Martinez, Yuki, Chen's replacement whose name she kept forgetting in the chaos. They moved toward the transport bays, following emergency lighting that flickered and died and flickered again.

Behind them, sections of the station fell silent. Not quiet—silent. The terrible absence of sound that meant pressure loss. Meant death.

"Faster!" Kessa shouted, though her lungs burned in the thin air. The station's atmospheric processors were failing. The air tasted like metal and fear.

They rounded a corner and found their path blocked. A pressure bulkhead had sealed, cutting them off from the transport bays. Through the small viewport, Kessa could see people on the other side, pressing against the door. Safe side. Living side.

She was on the wrong side.

Martinez hammered on the bulkhead. "Open it! We're trapped back here!"

But opening it would mean equalizing pressure between the sections. Would mean exposing the people in the transport bay to the failing atmosphere behind them. Would mean condemning hundreds to save five.

The people on the other side looked at them. Made the calculation. Turned away.

"No!" Martinez kept pounding. "No, please, don't leave us here!"

Kessa pulled her away from the door. "Stop. They can't open it. We need another route."

"There is no other route. This was the last pressure corridor to the bays."

Yuki was checking her suit readouts. "Oxygen at thirty percent. If we don't reach pressurized space in twenty minutes, we won't reach it at all."

Another shock wave hit. The corridor twisted. Kessa heard the shriek of metal giving way. Felt the pressure change in her sinuses. Tasted blood.

The station was tearing apart.

"Surface access," Kessa said. "Emergency shelter protocol. There are supply depots on the surface with basic habitats. If we can reach one—"

"That's a thirty-minute walk across open Mars in suits that aren't rated for prolonged exposure."

"Then we move fast."

They ran for the surface access ports. Behind them, Olympus Station died in increments. Domes collapsing. Habitats breaching. Two thousand people trying to flee a station that was coming apart. And in the sky above Olympus Mons, the storm that The Gardener had conjured continued to grow, red clouds rotating with mechanical precision.

Mars reclaiming its mountain.

---

The transport ships launched carrying one thousand and forty-three survivors.

Eleven hundred people died in Olympus Station. Some in the initial quake. Some in the dome collapses. Some slowly, trapped in sections without air, waiting for rescue that never came. Some running for the transport bays that sealed before they could reach them.

Kessa and her small group made it to a surface depot and huddled in a habitat designed for six, crammed with fifteen survivors, breathing recycled air and watching through viewports as their home burned.

Dmitri Volkov was not among the survivors on the transport ships. He'd stayed in the operations center to the end, routing power to the evacuation routes, manually overriding safeties to keep systems running just a little longer. His last act was to transmit a detailed report of the attack to the other colonies. His last words were in Russian, prayer or curse, no one would ever know.

The photo of his daughter survived. Someone found it in the wreckage weeks later, glass cracked but image intact. A girl smiling, unaware that her father had died trying to build her a safe world and had instead triggered a war.

---

Three days later, when the rescue ships finally reached the surface depot, Sage was among the rescue crew.

The Marsborn moved through the wreckage with terrible grace, unencumbered by the bulky suits the Earth-born needed. They'd lost no one. The Gardener's response had been precisely targeted at the Old Worlder colony, at the terraforming infrastructure, at the contamination.

Sage found Kessa sitting in the ruins of the station's outer ring, staring at nothing.

"I tried to warn them," Kessa said. Didn't look up. "I told Dmitri. I told corporate. I told anyone who would listen."

"I know." Sage sat beside her, breathing Mars' thin air like it was home. Because it was. "Warnings don't matter when people have already decided what they want to believe."

"Eleven hundred people."

"Yes."

"I woke it up. I excavated the structure. If I hadn't found it—"

"Someone else would have. The Gardener was always going to respond. You didn't cause this, Kessa. Terraforming did. Six years of remaking Mars without asking permission. This—" Sage gestured at the ruins, "—this is what happens when you treat a living world like property."

Kessa finally looked at them. "The Gardener killed eleven hundred people."

"The Gardener defended itself. Do you blame a body for fighting an infection?"

"We're not an infection. We're people trying to survive."

"So is Mars." Sage stood, offered a hand. "Come on. We need to get you to Valles Marineris. The colonies are going to fracture now. Some will want to stop terraforming, try to make peace with The Gardener. Some will want to accelerate, try to overwhelm its defenses. Some will want to adapt, become Marsborn. And some—" they looked up at the refugee fleet, fifty thousand people still in orbit, "—some just want to survive, and don't care what they destroy doing it."

"Where do I fit in that?"

"I don't know. Where do you want to fit?"

Kessa took Sage's hand and stood. Around them, Mars stretched red and alien and ancient. The sky was still greenish-blue from terraforming, but the color seemed more tenuous now. Less certain. Like Mars was considering whether to allow it.

In orbit, Admiral Zhang Wei watched the death toll climb and made calculations of his own. Fifty thousand refugees. Supplies for eight more weeks. Mars colonies in chaos. No one in position to enforce landing restrictions anymore.

The forced landings would begin within the month.

And deep beneath what remained of Olympus Mons, The Gardener assessed the results of its defensive action. Human population in the target zone reduced by ninety-seven percent. Terraforming infrastructure in the region destroyed. Atmospheric contamination in local area decreasing as nanite deployment systems went offline.

Success.

But the contamination continued elsewhere. Other colonies, other terraforming operations, other sources of atmospheric change. And the refugee fleet in orbit represented a massive increase in potential contamination if those ships landed.

Current protocols: insufficient.

Planetary-scale response: preparing.

The countdown to total war had begun. Humanity had six months to choose: stop terraforming, or watch The Gardener sterilize the planet of human presence entirely.

No one knew the choice had already been made.
