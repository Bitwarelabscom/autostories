# Chapter 6: Countdown

**Day 2,270 - Two Weeks Until Confrontation**

The pattern became Kessa's obsession. Every seismic event logged, timed, mapped. Every atmospheric fluctuation documented. Every electromagnetic pulse from the Beneath's crystalline networks recorded and analyzed. If corporate wanted extraordinary proof, she'd give them a dataset so comprehensive they'd have no choice but to acknowledge the Gardener's existence.

That was the theory, anyway.

"You need to sleep." Rajesh stood in her lab doorway, holding two meal packets and wearing the expression of someone who'd given this lecture before.

"I need to finish the correlation analysis." Kessa pulled up three months of terraforming data alongside the seismic records. The overlap was undeniable—every major nanite deployment corresponded to increased seismic activity within six to eighteen hours. "Look at this. Day 2,240, they increased deployment by eight percent. Eighteen hours later, magnitude 3.2 tremor. Day 2,255, another deployment increase. Fourteen hours later, magnitude 3.5."

"I believe you, Kessa. You don't need to convince me."

"I need to convince someone who can actually stop this." She accepted the meal packet, ate without tasting. "Sage's predictive model is holding steady. If the escalation continues at current rates, we have five months until the Gardener shifts to active elimination protocols. That's a month before the Year Seven threshold."

"And corporate still says it's natural seismic adjustment."

"Corporate says a lot of things." Kessa pulled up her encrypted comm channel—routed through three relay stations to avoid Olympus Station monitoring. "Sage sent updated atmospheric data from their network. The Gardener's not just responding to excavation anymore. It's responding to terraforming progress across the entire Tharsis region."

The data painted itself across her screen: localized atmospheric reversions, pockets where oxygen percentages dropped and CO2 concentrations rose. Small corrections, barely noticeable against the larger terraforming trends. But persistent. Deliberate.

The Gardener maintaining its project against human interference.

"When are you telling Volkov?" Rajesh asked.

"I'm not." Kessa saved the analysis, backed it up to three separate storage systems. "I sent him everything after the committee meeting. He filed it under 'speculative archaeology' and moved on. I'm done playing by rules that reward ignorance."

"So what's the alternative? Join Sage's independence movement? Help them sabotage the terraforming?"

"I don't know yet." It was the most honest thing she'd said in days. "But doing nothing while we walk toward catastrophe isn't an option either."

**Day 2,275 - Ten Days Until Confrontation**

The seismic interval had decreased to eight hours. Magnitude holding steady at 3.9, but the frequency acceleration worried Kessa more than the strength. The Gardener adapting its response patterns, learning to react faster to human activity.

She descended into the Beneath with a skeleton crew—Rajesh, Dr. Chen, two technicians. Corporate had approved "routine documentation" of the excavation site. They had no idea Kessa was installing monitoring equipment that would feed directly to Sage's network, bypassing Olympus Station's official channels entirely.

"This is espionage," Chen whispered as they installed the seventh sensor node. "If Volkov finds out—"

"He'll fire me. I'm aware." Kessa calibrated the node, watched it ping successfully to the encrypted relay. "But getting fired beats getting killed when the Gardener decides we're a problem that needs correcting."

The crystalline walls pulsed around them, bioluminescent light flowing in patterns that felt almost rhythmic. Kessa had spent weeks down here, and she'd started recognizing the pulse variations. Slow and steady when undisturbed. Rapid and bright during seismic events. And lately, a new pattern—irregular fluctuations that reminded her of thought processes. Neural activity in a planet-sized brain.

"It's thinking," she said softly.

"What?" Rajesh looked up from his installation work.

"The Gardener. Look at the pulse patterns." She pulled up her scanner, overlaid the light variations with electromagnetic readings. "These aren't just power fluctuations. They're too complex. Too variable. It's processing information."

Chen moved closer, studied the data. "If you're right, that means we're not dealing with simple automated responses. We're dealing with something that can analyze, adapt, decide."

"Which makes it either better or worse, depending on what it decides we are." Kessa finished the last sensor installation, stood back to admire their unauthorized surveillance network. "If it sees us as a threat, we're facing planetary-scale defensive response. If it sees us as contaminants, we're facing eradication. But if we can make it see us as potential partners..."

"You're talking about communicating with it." Rajesh's voice carried equal parts hope and disbelief.

"Sage thinks it's possible. The Marsborn have been trying for years, but they don't have the linguistic background or the archaeological context. I do." Kessa pulled up her research on the ancient Martian civilization—fragmentary records from the Jezero site, atmospheric composition data suggesting successful terraforming, evidence of extinction shortly after completion. "The Gardener's creators died out. It's been maintaining their final project for two million years. That's not simple automation. That's devotion."

"Or insanity," Chen said quietly. "A machine following obsolete programming long past the point of logic."

"Maybe." Kessa studied the pulsing walls. "But even obsolete programming responds to new input. We just need to figure out what input it will accept."

A tremor rolled through the chamber—magnitude 3.9, right on schedule. The walls flared bright, the pulse accelerating to that rapid, urgent rhythm. Around them, the Beneath seemed to shudder with something that might have been anger or might have been distress.

Kessa recorded everything.

**Day 2,283 - Four Days Until Confrontation**

"They're increasing nanite deployment again." Sage's voice crackled over the encrypted channel. "Fifteen percent this time. Largest acceleration since Year Five."

Kessa pulled up her predictive models, felt her stomach drop. "That'll trigger a response within twelve hours. Probably magnitude 4.0 or higher."

"Corporate knows that?"

"Corporate thinks correlation isn't causation." She studied the deployment schedule—timed to reach maximum atmospheric conversion before the Year Seven threshold. Every day closer to that deadline, the urgency increased. And every increase brought the Gardener's response one step closer to catastrophic. "Sage, at this escalation rate, your five-month prediction is generous. We might have three months."

"Then you need to make a choice, Dr. Okafor." Sage's tone carried no judgment, just fact. "Keep filing reports corporate ignores, or help us prepare for what's coming."

"Prepare how?"

"Independent settlements are stockpiling supplies, reinforcing structures, moving populations away from high-seismic zones. We're treating the Gardener's response as inevitable. When—not if—it escalates to magnitude 5.0 or higher, we'll be ready." Sage paused. "Olympus Station won't be. Corporate still thinks this is natural seismic adjustment. When a major quake hits, casualties will be significant."

Kessa thought of the thousands of people living in Olympus Station's corporate sector. Comfortable in their Earth-standard habitats, confident in engineering that had withstood six years of minor tremors. Unprepared for what planetary-scale defensive response actually meant.

"I can't just let them die," she said.

"Then convince them to prepare. Or join us and help save who you can." Sage's voice softened slightly. "Kessa, I understand your position. You want to believe evidence will change minds. But we're past that point. The Gardener is escalating. Corporate is accelerating terraforming. Those are collision courses. Mathematics, not politics."

"I need more time."

"Time's the one thing we don't have." Sage signed off.

Kessa sat in her lab, surrounded by data that screamed warnings no one wanted to hear. Outside her window, Mars turned beneath its greenish-blue sky—beautiful and terrible and utterly indifferent to human hopes.

She drafted another report to Volkov. Included the new correlation data, the deployment-response timelines, the predictive models showing catastrophic escalation within months.

She sent it.

She knew he wouldn't listen.

But she sent it anyway, because when the Gardener finally stopped warning and started eliminating, when magnitude 5.0 hit and buildings fell and people died, she needed the record to show she'd tried.

That someone had been paying attention.

That the mathematics had been clear all along.

**Day 2,287 - Two Days Until Confrontation**

The seismic interval had decreased to six hours. The Gardener's patience, like its response time, was running out.

Kessa packed her critical research into three redundant storage drives. Backed up everything to Sage's network. Prepared for the day Volkov finally lost patience with her warnings and revoked her access.

That day, she suspected, was coming soon.

Rajesh found her at sunset, watching Mars' sky fade from greenish-blue to the deep purple of Martian twilight. "Corporate sent out the official finding. 'Seismic activity remains within acceptable parameters for active terraforming operations. No changes to current timeline required.'"

"Of course they did." Kessa didn't look away from the sky. "The fifteen percent deployment increase happened six hours ago. We should see the response any minute now."

They stood together in silence, waiting.

At six hours and seventeen minutes, the tremor hit.

Magnitude 4.2.

The strongest yet.

Olympus Station shuddered. Emergency lights flickered. Somewhere in the corporate sector, alarms began to wail.

Kessa's comm lit up with messages—damage reports, injury counts, structural assessments. Cracks in pressure seals. Collapsed corridors in the lower levels. Three people hospitalized with injuries from falling equipment.

The first casualties.

Not deaths. Not yet.

But the Gardener was making its point clear: escalation would continue until the contamination stopped.

And corporate had just committed to accelerating that contamination.

Kessa looked at Rajesh in the emergency lighting. "Pack your essentials. Things corporate can't confiscate. Research that matters. Personal items you can't replace."

"Why?"

"Because in two days, Volkov's going to call me into his office and end my excavation access. Maybe my employment entirely. And I need to be ready to work outside corporate authority when that happens."

"You're really going to join Sage?"

"I'm going to do what the mathematics demands." Kessa turned from the window, from the beautiful terrible sky, from the comfortable illusions of corporate control. "I'm going to prepare for catastrophe. And when it comes—when the Gardener stops asking us to leave and starts making us—I'm going to try to save whoever will listen."

"That might not be many people."

"I know."

The emergency lighting cast strange shadows across her lab. Outside, Mars continued its patient rotation, and beneath its red soil, the Gardener continued its patient count down.

Six hours until the next tremor.

Two days until corporate confrontation.

Three months until planetary catastrophe.

The mathematics were clear.

Kessa just had to survive long enough to be proven right.
