# Chapter 13: Grief and Numbers

Kessa found Rajesh in the collapsed maintenance tunnel eight hours after the magnitude 5.7 earthquake. Or rather, she found what was left of him. The rescue teams had already removed his body when she arrived, but his workspace remained—shattered equipment, broken screens still showing sensor data, and a final message logged in the system at 03:16, one minute before the quake hit:

*Deployment increase 17%. Gardener response imminent. All data backing up to Sage's network and Zhang's fleet. If I don't make it out, someone make sure Kessa knows this wasn't her fault. —Rajesh*

Kessa read it seven times before her vision blurred too much to continue.

"I'm sorry." Sage had come to Olympus Station personally, arriving twelve hours after the quake. They stood with Kessa in the damaged tunnel, surveying the ruins of research that had cost three lives. "He was trying to help."

"He was trying to prove I was right." Kessa's voice sounded hollow in her own ears. "I should have been here. Should have maintained the network myself. Should have—"

"Made different choices that would have killed you instead." Sage's directness cut through her spiral. "Kessa, Rajesh chose to stay. You chose to find alternatives. Both choices were valid. Both served purpose. His death doesn't negate that."

"Three people are dead." Kessa pulled up the casualty list. Dr. Chen, who'd tried to support her in the committee meeting. Dr. Williams from geological survey. Rajesh, loyal to the end. "Three people died gathering evidence corporate still won't acknowledge."

"Four hundred thirty-seven injured. Two habitat sectors condemned. Estimated repair costs exceeding the annual terraforming budget." Sage showed her the station's damage assessment. "Corporate can't ignore this anymore. They're calling emergency session tomorrow. Colonial council, corporate leadership, Earth representatives, even invited Zhang's fleet to send observers. They have to respond."

"They'll respond by accelerating harder. Dmitri made it clear—stopping kills the refugees, so he won't stop. Even if continuing kills us." Kessa looked at the broken equipment, Rajesh's final data still uploading through damaged connections. "Mathematics without mercy."

"Then we need to give them a third option." Sage pulled up the scenarios they'd modeled at Valles Marineris. "Compromise solution. Partial terraforming in designated zones. Adaptation programs for those who can't survive Mars-standard. Independent settlements recognized and protected. Everyone sacrifices something, everyone gets something."

"The Gardener still has to agree."

"Which is where you come in." Sage highlighted the interface data from Chapter 8. "You've communicated with it directly. You understand its purpose. If anyone can negotiate compromise, it's you."

Kessa thought about the vision of ancient Mars, the beautiful dead civilization, the Gardener's patient warning: *Terraforming completion triggers extinction event.* Could she convince it that humans would do better? That they'd learned from the ancient Martians' mistake?

"I'll try," she said. "But the interface is sealed behind blast doors. Corporate welded it shut."

"Then we unweld it." Sage's expression was grim. "Emergency repair teams are working throughout the station. Lots of equipment moving, lots of restricted areas accessible during repairs. If we move fast, we can get you back into the Beneath before corporate realizes."

"That's breaking about seventeen different regulations."

"Three people are dead, Kessa. Four hundred thirty-seven injured. Corporate's regulations haven't saved anyone yet." Sage pulled up schematics of the sealed excavation site. "We have maybe forty-eight hours before repairs complete and security tightens again. After that, the site stays sealed until corporate decides otherwise. This might be your only chance."

Kessa looked at Rajesh's message one more time. *Make sure Kessa knows this wasn't her fault.*

It was her fault. Her excavation had woken the Gardener. Her investigation had pushed corporate into suppression. Her choices had led to this moment.

But Rajesh had also written: *All data backing up to Sage's network and Zhang's fleet.* He'd made sure their work would continue. Made sure someone could use the evidence they'd gathered.

The least she could do was make his sacrifice mean something.

"Forty-eight hours," she said. "Let's make them count."

**Day 2,326 - Emergency Council Session**

The emergency colonial council convened in a reinforced conference facility, the only meeting space large enough and structurally sound enough to hold everyone who mattered. Kessa sat in the observer section, watching corporate leadership face questions they'd been avoiding for weeks.

Dmitri Volkov looked like he'd aged a decade in six days. He stood at the podium, delivering damage reports with mechanical precision.

"Three confirmed fatalities. Four hundred thirty-seven injured, seventeen critical. Two habitat sectors condemned, total loss. Eight sectors requiring major repairs. Estimated cost: 2.3 billion in colonial credits. Estimated timeline for full repairs: eight months." He pulled up structural analyses. "Olympus Station remains operational but vulnerable. Another magnitude 5.7 or higher could trigger catastrophic failures."

Marcus Reeves, appearing via video delay from Earth, leaned forward on the screen. "Director Volkov, is there any indication this seismic activity will decrease?"

"No. Our geological survey predicts continued escalation if terraforming operations continue at current rates."

"Then we reduce deployment rates. Slow the acceleration."

"That extends the timeline to Year Seven threshold by eighteen months. The refugee fleet has supplies for five months." Volkov's voice was flat, emotionless. Professional mask over personal devastation. "Slowing deployment kills the refugees."

Admiral Zhang's image appeared on a secondary screen—he'd been granted observer status. "Director Volkov, what if we discuss alternative solutions? Partial terraforming, genetic adaptation programs, zone-based settlements?"

"Admiral, with respect, genetic adaptation requires technology and resources we don't possess in sufficient scale. Partial terraforming leaves refugees in terminal limbo. Zone-based settlements create two-tier colonial society. These are compromises that doom everyone differently."

"Better than dooming everyone equally." Zhang's voice carried command weight. "I've reviewed Dr. Okafor's research and the Marsborn scenarios. Compromise is possible if all parties accept sacrifices."

"The sacrifice you're proposing includes my daughter and forty-nine thousand nine hundred ninety-nine others accepting they're no longer human." For the first time, Volkov's mask cracked. "You're asking parents to choose between watching their children die or watching them transform into something alien. That's not compromise, Admiral. That's choosing which nightmare to accept."

The chamber went silent.

Kessa stood, surprising herself. "Director Volkov is right. The compromises we're discussing are terrible. But so is the alternative." Every eye turned to her. "I've communicated directly with the planetary system. It's not trying to kill us. It's trying to save us from repeating the mistake that killed its creators. The ancient Martians succeeded in terraforming and then died out. The Gardener thinks continuing our terraforming will trigger the same result."

Marcus Reeves' delayed response: "Dr. Okafor, your claims of communication with an alien system are unsupported by—"

"By geological survey's analysis, yes, I know. But Admiral Zhang's military analysts verified the mathematical intelligence. The countdown to elimination protocols is real. We have 272 days before the Gardener decides we're irreversible contamination and activates planetary sterilization." She pulled up the data on the main display. "Every deployment increase triggers proportional response. The pattern is exact. Magnitude 4.6, magnitude 5.1, magnitude 5.7. Next deployment will trigger magnitude 6.0 or higher. And corporate is planning that deployment for tomorrow."

Volkov's expression went cold. "That deployment is classified information."

"I have sources. The point is, if you proceed, hundreds more will die. Maybe thousands. And the Gardener will keep escalating until we stop or it eliminates us." Kessa met his eyes. "Director, I know about your daughter. I understand why you're pushing. But continuing this path kills her too. Kills everyone. The only way forward is compromise."

"The only way forward is completing terraforming before elimination protocols activate." Volkov's voice was steel. "We have 272 days. Year Seven threshold is ten months. If we accelerate hard enough, we can reach irreversibility before the Gardener sterilizes the planet. Lock in atmospheric conversion so even if the system activates, it's too late to reverse. Force adaptation on the system instead of us adapting to it."

The room erupted. Zhang protesting the risk. Marsborn representatives shouting about genocide. Earth corporate calculating timelines.

And Kessa, standing in the observer section, realizing with sick certainty what Volkov was actually proposing.

A race. Terraforming versus elimination. Betting that human engineering could finish before the Gardener could stop them.

"You're going to trigger it deliberately," she said, voice cutting through chaos. "You're going to push past every warning, force the Gardener to escalate, and try to complete terraforming before it can activate elimination protocols."

"I'm going to save fifty thousand lives," Volkov said quietly. "Using the time we have left. If that requires accepting casualties from seismic response, so be it. Better some survive than none."

"And if you're wrong? If the Gardener activates elimination before you finish?"

"Then we all die together. But at least we tried to save everyone instead of choosing who gets sacrificed."

Kessa saw it then—the calculation behind his eyes. He knew this was desperate. Knew the odds weren't good. But he'd rather bet on impossible success than accept certain sacrifice.

It was insane.

It was absolutely logical.

It was going to get them all killed.

"I have a proposal," Sage said, standing in the Marsborn section. "Give us seventy-two hours. Dr. Okafor can attempt direct communication with the Gardener through the neural interface. If she can negotiate compromise—actual terms the system will accept—we explore that path. If she fails, corporate proceeds with their acceleration plan. Three days won't change your timeline significantly, Director."

Volkov looked at Sage, at Kessa, at the screens showing casualty counts and structural damage.

"Seventy-two hours," he said finally. "Dr. Okafor has three days to negotiate with alien intelligence that's killed three people. If she succeeds, we discuss compromise. If she fails or if the Gardener escalates during that period, we proceed with full acceleration."

"The excavation site is sealed," Kessa said.

"Then unseal it. Emergency repair authorization." Volkov pulled up a security clearance. "Dr. Okafor has full site access for seventy-two hours. After that, sealed or not, we're done waiting."

He sat down, exhaustion evident in every movement.

The council dissolved into arguments about compromise terms, acceleration timelines, evacuation protocols. But Kessa barely heard them.

Seventy-two hours.

Three days to communicate with planetary intelligence and find terms both humans and ancient AI could accept.

Three days to save everyone or watch Volkov's desperate acceleration race toward catastrophe.

Rajesh had died gathering evidence.

Chen had died supporting her findings.

The least Kessa could do was try to make their deaths mean something.

She left the council chamber and started preparing for the descent into the Beneath.

One more time.

For Rajesh.

For the three dead and four hundred thirty-seven injured.

For Dmitri's twelve-year-old daughter and Zhang's fifty thousand faces.

For the mathematics that said everyone's survival depended on finding mercy in an alien system programmed for patience that was running out.

Seventy-two hours.

The countdown within the countdown began.
