# Chapter 2: Echoes in Red Dust

The surface lab smelled of recycled air and Martian dust—a smell Kessa had long ago stopped noticing. Seventy-two hours since she'd touched the crystalline wall in the Beneath, and she hadn't slept more than eight hours total. The samples arranged across three workbenches gleamed under LED lights: fragments of that strange bioluminescent material, core samples from the tunnel walls, atmospheric readings from the alien chambers.

And the seismic data. Always the seismic data, scrolling across her monitor in waves of troubling precision.

"You're going to collapse," Rajesh said from the doorway. He held two bulbs of coffee, the expensive kind imported from Earth at shocking cost. A peace offering.

"I'm fine." Kessa didn't look up from the spectroscopic analysis. The crystalline fragments showed a composition that shouldn't exist—silicon-based matrix interwoven with organic compounds that Earth's databases didn't recognize. "Rajesh, look at this lattice structure. It's not just crystallized minerals. These are data storage nodes, or maybe processing substrates. The entire structure might be computational."

"Then it can wait until you've slept." He set one coffee bulb beside her hand, tethered it with a magnetic clip so it wouldn't drift. Low gravity had a way of making everything float at the worst moments. "I pulled your biometric data. Your cortisol levels are—"

"I don't care about my cortisol levels." But she took the coffee, sipped it. Rich and dark and perfect. "Thank you."

"You're welcome." Rajesh pulled up a chair, studied her monitor over her shoulder. "What am I looking at?"

"Proof." Kessa pulled up a second dataset, overlaid it with the first. "These are the seismic readings from the hour after I touched the wall. See these patterns? That's not natural tectonic activity. The pulses are too regular, too... responsive."

"Responsive to what?"

"To us." She highlighted a sequence. "Seventeen minutes after I made contact, magnitude 2.5 tremor. Forty-three minutes later, another one. Then again at one hour and twelve minutes. The intervals are decreasing, but the pattern holds. It's like..." She paused, searching for the right analogy. "Like when you tap a beehive. First response is investigation. Then comes agitation."

Rajesh leaned closer, his reflection ghostly in the monitor's surface. Outside the lab's reinforced windows, Mars stretched red and endless beneath a greenish-blue sky—six years of terraforming visible in that strange color. "You're saying the structure knows we're there."

"I'm saying the structure responded to human contact after two million years of dormancy. That implies active monitoring systems. Power generation. Computational processing." Kessa felt that familiar thrill, the one that had driven her through years of academic drudgery and grant applications. "Rajesh, this is the single most significant archaeological discovery in human history. We're not looking at ruins. We're looking at a functioning alien installation."

He was quiet for a long moment. Then: "You know you have to report this to Volkov."

The thrill guttered. "I know."

"Corporate charter requires notification within seventy-two hours of any discovery that might impact terraforming operations."

"It's been seventy-two hours." Kessa pulled up another window, began compiling her preliminary findings into a report. Academic precision took over: executive summary, methodology, data tables, conclusions. She kept her language careful, neutral. *Alien structure identified. Evidence of active systems. Recommend immediate comprehensive study before continuing excavation operations.*

"He's going to ask about timeline impact," Rajesh said quietly.

"Then I'll tell him I don't know yet." Kessa attached the seismic data, the spectroscopic analyses, three dozen high-resolution images of the Beneath's architecture. "Science doesn't run on corporate schedules."

"No, but we do." Rajesh stood, squeezed her shoulder. "Just... be diplomatic. Volkov's not a bad man, but he's got pressure from Earth. The refugee fleet situation, the Year Seven threshold. Timing couldn't be worse."

Kessa hit send before she could second-guess herself. The report arrowed through Olympus Station's network toward the director's office, three kilometers away in the corporate sector. "When is the timing ever good for discovering that Mars was terraformed before?"

She meant it as a joke. Rajesh didn't smile.

The video call came ninety minutes later, interrupting Kessa's attempt at eating something that might charitably be called dinner. She accepted the connection, and Director Dmitri Volkov resolved on her screen in high definition—broad shoulders, close-cropped gray hair, the kind of face that looked comfortable giving orders.

"Dr. Okafor." His English carried that precise Russian accent, each syllable measured. "I've reviewed your report."

"Director." Kessa straightened, suddenly aware of the dust on her work clothes, the exhaustion bruised beneath her eyes. She'd meant to change before this call. Too late now.

"Fascinating findings. Truly." Volkov's expression didn't match the word—he looked like a man calculating costs, not celebrating discoveries. "Walk me through the structural analysis. You believe this... installation... extends beyond the immediate excavation site?"

"The seismic data suggests extensive networks beneath the Tharsis region. Ground-penetrating radar shows anomalies consistent with constructed tunnels extending at least fifty kilometers in multiple directions. But we need more time to map the full extent—"

"Time." Volkov leaned back in his chair, steepled his fingers. "How much time, Dr. Okafor?"

Here it was. The question that turned science into politics. "A comprehensive survey would require six months minimum. Full excavation and documentation, perhaps two years. But Director, this is—"

"Two years." He said it like a curse. "We have ten months until Year Seven threshold. Ten months until the refugee fleet's situation becomes critical. Ten months until atmospheric conversion becomes irreversible." His gaze was steady, not unkind, but absolutely immovable. "I cannot halt terraforming operations for two years based on preliminary data."

"I'm not asking you to halt operations." Kessa heard her voice rising, forced it level. "I'm asking for a comprehensive study before we continue excavating in an area that contains active alien technology. The seismic responses alone indicate—"

"Indicate tremors of magnitude 2.5. Barely perceptible." Volkov pulled up a secondary screen, scanned something off-camera. "We've had stronger quakes from standard tectonic adjustment. Mars is a geologically active planet, Dr. Okafor."

"Not like this. The pattern—"

"Patterns can be coincidental." But his tone had shifted, just slightly. Less dismissive. "Send me your raw data. I'll have the geological survey team review it independently. If they confirm your analysis, we'll discuss next steps."

Translation: corporate approval required before any action. Kessa swallowed her frustration. "Of course. I'll forward everything within the hour."

"Good." Volkov nodded, already moving to end the call. Then he paused. "Dr. Okafor. Your work on the Jezero artifacts—I read your papers when we were considering this excavation. Brilliant scholarship. I respect your expertise."

"Thank you, Director."

"But expertise must balance with practical realities. We have fifty thousand people in orbit running out of air and food. We have Earth governments demanding progress reports. We have investors expecting return on seventy years of terraforming investment." His eyes held something that might have been sympathy. "Find me actionable data that justifies delay, and I'll listen. Find me wonder and mystery, and I'll note it for the history books. Understand the difference."

The call ended.

Kessa sat in silence, staring at her reflection in the darkened screen. Behind her, through the lab windows, Mars glowed beneath its changing sky. Somewhere far beneath Olympus Mons, two kilometers of red rock away, the Beneath waited in its bioluminescent darkness.

She pulled up the seismic data again. Studied the pattern of tremors, their decreasing intervals, their growing precision.

*Like tapping a beehive*, she'd told Rajesh.

She hadn't mentioned what came after investigation and agitation.

Defense.

The tremor hit at 03:47 local time, yanking Kessa from shallow sleep. Magnitude 3.1, centered directly beneath the excavation site. Her quarters shuddered, dust raining from ceiling seams. Emergency lights flickered on as primary power systems stuttered.

It lasted eighteen seconds.

When the shaking stopped, Kessa was already at her terminal, pulling up the seismic network. The data painted itself across her screen in real-time: epicenter at 2.1 kilometers depth, exactly where the Beneath's central chamber pulsed with alien light.

Seventeen hours since her report to Volkov.

Seventeen hours since corporate review began.

Seventeen hours since human bureaucracy started making decisions about something they didn't understand.

The seismic pattern held steady on her monitor, and Kessa stared at it with growing dread. Not because the structure had responded again.

But because the response was getting stronger.

Outside her window, Mars turned beneath its greenish sky, and somewhere in the corporate sector, Dmitri Volkov was probably receiving the same seismic alert. Probably making the same calculations. Probably reaching very different conclusions.

Kessa started drafting her second report before the aftershocks finished.

This time, she thought, maybe she'd use smaller words.

Maybe she'd remember that wonder and mystery didn't matter when fifty thousand lives hung in orbit.

Maybe she'd find a way to make them understand that those lives—all their lives—depended on understanding the thing sleeping beneath Mars.

Before it woke up completely.
