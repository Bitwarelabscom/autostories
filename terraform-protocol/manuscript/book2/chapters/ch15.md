# Chapter 15: Final Preparations

*Day 2,449, morning. 18 hours until emergency summit. Final preparations.*

Kessa reviewed her presentation one last time: Creator extinction evidence. Test zone success. Territorial implementation plan. Population cap frameworks. The Gardener's terms.

Everything that would either finalize humanity's survival on Mars or document its final failure to compromise.

Sage coordinated Marsborn delegation logistics. "Forty-seven settlements sending representatives. That's unanimous Marsborn support for territorial division. First time we've agreed on anything planet-wide."

"Chen's faction?"

"Split. She has majority support but fifteen percent oppose any limits. They'll attend but vote against."

"Zhang?"

"Desperate enough to accept anything. His supplies are critical. Two more days in orbit means more casualties. He needs this to succeed."

The three factions had spent eleven days converting framework to implementation plan. Had tested it successfully. Had negotiated every detail.

Now came the moment when political reality met survival necessity.

"The Gardener is monitoring," Kessa said, feeling its presence through the chamber sensors. "It's waiting to see if we can formalize what we've negotiated."

"And if we can't?"

"Enforcement. Two thousand to four thousand casualties implementing atmospheric reversion. Forced evacuation of unadapted populations. Everything we've worked to prevent."

"No pressure then."

"Just the fate of two species and one planet. Minimal stakes."

They finished preparations in silence, each knowing tomorrow would determine whether communication had been sufficient or just elaborate prelude to catastrophe.

Chen stood in her command center, atmospheric conversion still at 6.994%. Eleven days at cascade threshold without crossing. Eleven days demonstrating restraint.

Tomorrow she'd either formalize that restraint through territorial agreement or resume acceleration to cascade regardless of consequences.

"If the summit fails," her chief engineer asked, "do we resume immediately?"

"If it fails, The Gardener enforces atmospheric reversion. We won't have chance to resume. Either we agree to limits or limits are forced on us."

"And you're voting for agreement?"

"I'm voting for survival. The territorial division gives us 20%. That's not everything I wanted. But it's enough to settle fifty thousand refugees and build foundation for millions more. It's enough."

"Even with population caps?"

"Population caps are future problem. Immediate problem is preventing enforcement that kills thousands. I choose solving immediate problem."

The engineer nodded. "Tomorrow then."

"Tomorrow we find out if humanity's better at cooperation than the creators were."

Zhang's final supply count: thirty-six hours. Just enough to reach summit, receive decision, implement or evacuate.

"If agreement fails," his operations officer said, "we have fuel for one last mass landing. Emergency protocols. Six thousand people in twelve hours before supplies critically deplete."

"And the other thirty-three thousand?"

Silence answered.

Zhang had made peace with impossible mathematics months ago. Some would survive. Some wouldn't. His job was maximizing the first category while honoring the second.

"If summit succeeds, we land everyone in completion zones over the next week. Orderly, supported, survivable."

"And if it fails?"

"We land six thousand in chaos and mourn thirty-three thousand we couldn't save."

The officer returned to preparations.

Zhang reviewed the territorial agreement one final time. It was imperfect. Constrained. Limited.

It was also survival.

Tomorrow he'd vote for it and hope three factions could agree when everything else had failed them.

---

Eighteen hours until summit.

Three factions preparing.

One planetary intelligence monitoring.

Territorial division ready for implementation.

Or enforcement ready for activation.

Humanity's final choice.

Tomorrow at dawn.

Kessa tried to sleep and failed.

Spent the night reviewing data one more time.

Hoping translation had been sufficient.

Hoping communication had mattered.

Hoping understanding could become agreement.

Hoping agreement could become implementation.

Hoping implementation could become survival.

Chain of hopes that would break or hold tomorrow.

Dawn came eventually.

The summit with it.

And humanity's last negotiation with Mars itself.
