# Chapter 18: First Implementations

*Days 2,450-2,470. Immediate aftermath of Ch17 summit. Twenty days of initial implementation.*

The forced neural experience at the emergency summit had changed everything. All faction leaders—Chen, Zhang, Marsborn elders—had experienced not just the creators' extinction but the consequences of their own choices. Chen felt her colonists suffocating from atmospheric reversion. Zhang watched his fleet die in orbit. Marsborn witnessed communities fractured.

The Gardener had made abstract consequences visceral. And unanimous acceptance had followed.

Now came implementation.

**Day 2,450: Boundary Establishment**

Survey teams from all three factions began mapping completion zone boundaries. Northern equatorial band, 19.3% of planetary surface, divided into three primary zones: New Beijing (Zhang's refugees, 7.2%), Hellas Completion (Chen's colonists, 8.9%), Tharsis Expansion (joint development, 3.2%).

The buffer zones required engineering Chen's teams had never attempted: atmospheric gradient maintenance over five-kilometer bands. The test zone had proven concept. Scaling to 290 kilometers of total boundary perimeter was different magnitude.

"We're deploying atmospheric processors every 500 meters," Chen's chief engineer reported. "Active monitoring. Real-time adjustments. It'll work but requires constant maintenance."

"Better than enforcement," Chen replied.

**Day 2,453: Initial Refugee Settlement**

Zhang's emergency landing operations accelerated. With completion zones designated and atmospheric processing beginning, refugees could land safely in larger numbers.

First wave: 2,000 people to New Beijing zone over three days. Casualties: zero. Atmospheric support: stable. Resource allocation: sufficient.

"This is what success looks like," Zhang transmitted to Emergency Council. "Orderly, supported, survivable. Thank you."

38,000 remained in orbit. But timeline was achievable: thirty-five days to evacuate all at current rate. Supplies would last.

**Day 2,458: Marsborn Transition**

The harder aspect: Marsborn communities in areas designated as completion zones. 1,400 people who'd built lives in regions that would transform to Earth-atmosphere.

Sage coordinated relocations. "We're offering settlement support in equilibrium zones. Full resource assistance. Cultural continuity programs. But it's still displacement."

Some accepted. Some resisted. Three communities refused evacuation, citing historical settlement rights.

"If they stay, they die when atmosphere transforms," Chen warned Emergency Council.

"Then we delay transformation in disputed territories," Kessa proposed. "Give them time to decide. Three months."

The Gardener's response: *Delays acceptable if contained. Disputed territories become last completion zones. Three months is reasonable grace period.*

The three communities accepted temporary reprieve. Began planning either adaptation or evacuation.

**Day 2,465: First Violations**

A Continuist facility in Hellas Completion zone placed atmospheric processors 300 meters beyond designated boundary. Marsborn sensors detected immediately.

Emergency Council convened. The violation response protocols activated: Warning (issued). Economic sanctions (pending). Territorial restrictions (if escalates). Gardener enforcement (atmospheric violations only).

Chen apologized. "Engineer error. Processors relocated immediately. Will not recur."

The processors moved. The incident logged. The system worked.

But it demonstrated fragility. One error, one miscalculation, and compliance became violation.

**Day 2,470: Progress Assessment**

Three weeks post-summit. Kessa compiled status report:

Completion zones: Established. Atmospheric processing at 18% capacity (sufficient for current population, expanding as refugees settle).

Equilibrium zones: Maintained. No contamination detected. Marsborn communities stable.

Buffer zones: Functional. Atmospheric gradient holding. 290km perimeter operational.

Population: 67,000 total (23,000 completion zones, 41,000 equilibrium zones, 3,000 buffer/disputed).

Refugees settled: 2,000 on surface, 38,000 in orbit (landing operations ongoing).

Violations: 1 (resolved without enforcement).

"It's working," Kessa told Sage. "Imperfectly, fragilely, barely. But working."

"The Gardener's assessment?"

Kessa consulted the neural link she'd maintained since the summit. "It says: 'Initial compliance observed. Territorial boundaries respected. Population within limits. Violations minor and corrected. Guardianship mode engaged. Will monitor and protect while humans demonstrate capacity for sustained limitation. Twenty days insufficient to judge long-term viability. But twenty days better than zero days. Continue.'"

"That's practically glowing praise from something that threatened to kill thousands."

"It's recognition that we're trying. And succeeding at trying. That's all we can ask."

The implementation continued.

Refugees landing daily. Boundaries maintained. Violations caught and corrected. The Gardener watching but not enforcing.

Two species of humans, one planetary intelligence, divided territories and shared survival.

The garden they'd nearly destroyed being tended carefully.

By multiple gardeners learning to cooperate.

Twenty days didn't prove permanence. But it proved possibility.

And possibility was enough to build on.

As Kessa transmitted to all factions: "First contact succeeded. First cooperation working. First twenty days survived. Now we prove we can sustain this. Because The Gardener is watching. And will guard what we maintain."

The message received.

The work continued.

The experiment in shared planetary management entered its next phase.

And three months later, the true test would begin.

But that was future crisis.

Today's crisis was managed.

That had to be enough.
