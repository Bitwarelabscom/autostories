# Chapter 6: Before the Storm

*Day 2,419. Eleven days into communication. Nineteen days until Zhang's supplies run out. Eight hours until Chen reaches 6.95%. Four hours until The Gardener's coordinated enforcement.*

Kessa hadn't slept in forty-three hours. The stimulants were wearing off and reality had acquired a dream-like quality where numbers meant everything and nothing simultaneously.

6.92% atmospheric conversion. Chen's final push.

Four atmospheric facilities running maximum output.

Two hundred thirty-eight personnel in those facilities who'd received one-hour evacuation warnings and were implementing emergency shutdown procedures.

Except Chen had ordered half of them to stay. To keep production running until the last possible minute. To squeeze out another 0.03% before The Gardener's enforcement hit.

"She's going to kill them," Kessa said to the empty chamber. The Gardener's lights pulsed red. Listening. Always listening.

She transmitted: *Please delay enforcement. Give more time for evacuation. Chen's personnel are following orders. They don't deserve to die for her decisions.*

The response came in sixty-two elements. The most complex communication yet. Kessa translated with numb precision:

*Time for mercy has concluded. Warned for eleven days. Provided evacuation windows. Communicated consequences. Chen's personnel choose obedience to her over safety. This is their decision. Enforcement proceeds in four hours at three primary facilities: Hellas Processing Alpha, Syrtis Major Nanite Production, Meridiani Atmospheric Control. Magnitude 6.2, 6.5, 6.8 respectively. Evacuate or die. The choice belongs to humans. The enforcement belongs to me.*

Kessa forwarded the message to all factions. Then sat in silence, watching countdown timers tick toward multiple disasters.

Four hours.

Above her, Mars was fracturing faster than tectonics could explain.

Sage coordinated evacuation operations from Red Canyon, managing logistics for seventeen Marsborn settlements simultaneously. The refugees they'd harbored—1,014 people—needed to be moved to secure zones before The Gardener's enforcement. Because magnitude 6.8 earthquakes didn't respect compassion or shield tactics.

"Canyon Falls is evacuating east," Sage reported to Elder Kai. "Moving two hundred seventeen people—their Marsborn plus the refugees they harbored. Labyrinth Home going south. Mariner Valley northwest. We're spreading out in case The Gardener targets concentrations."

"Do we think it'll target Marsborn settlements?"

"I don't know anymore. We lost protected status by harboring refugees. The Gardener's message said 'evacuate or die' without specifying who qualifies as evacuation-worthy. We assume it'll still distinguish adapted from unadapted biology, but assumptions have killed a lot of people lately."

"Eighty-seven in martyrdom. More from toxicity."

"And three hundred to six hundred about to die when Chen's facilities collapse."

The numbers had weight now. Not statistics—people. Elder Yuki from Silent Canyon, who'd transmitted final poetry before oxygen toxicity killed her. The fourteen-year-old from Rust Valley whose name Sage hadn't learned before he died. The engineers at Hellas who'd been ordered to stay and were now racing shutdown procedures against seismic countdown.

"Zhang's launching third wave," Elder Kai reported, monitoring fleet communications. "Eight hundred more refugees. Coordinating landing for after The Gardener's enforcement. Banking on chaos providing cover."

"That's tactical exploitation of disaster."

"That's desperate command decisions. Zhang has nineteen days of supplies remaining and fifty thousand people. He'll land them however he can. The Gardener's enforcement creates windows. He'll use them."

Sage wanted to be angry at Zhang's tactics. Wanted to rage against using catastrophe as cover for expansion. But they'd made similar calculations accepting refugees. Everyone was exploiting something—Chen exploiting nanite cascades, Zhang exploiting Marsborn protection, Marsborn exploiting moral high ground while enabling both.

No one was innocent. Everyone was desperate.

And in four hours, The Gardener would remind everyone who actually controlled Mars.

Dr. Chen stood in Hellas Processing Alpha's command center, watching seismic predictions update. Magnitude 6.2 centered on this exact location in three hours forty-seven minutes.

Her chief engineer was coordinating evacuation. Two hundred six personnel total. Emergency transports could evacuate one hundred eighty in available time if they left now.

Twenty-six people would have to stay to maintain production until the last minute. Chen had asked for volunteers. Thirty-two people had stepped forward. She'd selected twenty-six based on skills—needed engineers to manage shutdown sequencing, technicians to extract final output, safety personnel to prevent cascade failures in the nanite storage.

She'd sent the other six away. Told them their courage was noted but skills were redundant.

Six people relieved to be dismissed from dying for atmospheric percentages.

Twenty-six people preparing for exactly that.

"We're at six point nine three," her chief engineer reported. "Another point zero two and Chen, we've reached 6.95%. The threshold where The Gardener enforces. Can we evacuate then? Can the twenty-six leave?"

"The Gardener gave four-hour warning. Enforcement timing based on the warning, not the threshold. We could hit six point nine five in two hours and The Gardener would still wait until warning period expires."

"So the twenty-six stay."

"The twenty-six stay."

Chen looked at the personnel manifest. Ages ranging twenty-four to sixty-one. Backgrounds from Earth, Mars, orbital stations. United by belief that completing atmospheric transformation justified the costs.

Twenty-six people about to die for that belief.

She'd told herself this was about saving humanity. About creating Mars that supported millions instead of thousands. About proving human ingenuity could overcome even planetary intelligence opposition.

But looking at names—actual people, not statistics—the rationalization felt hollow.

"Dr. Chen." The engineer's voice was quiet. "The twenty-six. They volunteered knowing death was certain. No rescue possible after magnitude six point two. You didn't force them. They chose."

"I created the situation where their choice was necessary. That's the same thing."

"It's not. You're carrying responsibility, yes. But they're carrying their own choices. Honor that."

Chen transmitted message to the twenty-six: *You are not expendable. You are invaluable. The transformation you're completing will support generations. Mars will remember. Humanity will remember. I will remember. Thank you for choosing this. For choosing humanity's future over personal safety. For being the margin that makes success possible. Atmospheric conversion will reach six point nine five percent because of your work. That number is not abstraction. It's your legacy. Transmit final messages to anyone you choose. I'll ensure they're delivered.*

The responses came. Some to families on Earth. Some to communities on Mars. Some to no one—people who'd lived for the work and wanted final words to be data logs, not sentiment.

One engineer, twenty-seven years old, transmitted to Chen directly: *No regrets. Came to Mars to build something permanent. Dying to complete that work is more meaningful than living compromised version. Tell my parents I finished what I started.*

Chen recorded it. Would deliver it personally if she survived what came after.

Three hours twenty-one minutes remaining.

Atmospheric conversion: 6.94%.

So close.

Admiral Zhang watched from orbit as Mars prepared for coordinated catastrophe. His tactical display showed Chen's facilities, The Gardener's projected seismic zones, Marsborn evacuation routes, his own third-wave landing trajectories.

Eight hundred refugees in this wave. Bringing total grounded to approximately 1,800 out of 48,200 remaining in fleet. Less than four percent settled. Ninety-six percent still dependent on failing life support.

"Third wave launches in six hours," his operations officer reported. "After The Gardener's enforcement concludes. Landing zones coordinated with Marsborn communities who'll accept post-enforcement."

"Seventeen settlements remaining?"

"Fourteen. Three refused after losing protected status. Said they won't participate in shield exploitation regardless of humanitarian need."

Zhang respected their position even as he violated it. Using Marsborn as shields was exploitation. He knew it. They knew it. But forty-eight thousand people couldn't wait for ethical clarity.

"What's Chen's timeline?"

"Six point nine four percent. Another point zero one and she's technically past enforcement trigger. The Gardener warned it would enforce at six point nine five. If she reaches that before the earthquake hits, she claims success."

"Success measured by reaching threshold while twenty-six people die maintaining production?"

"Success measured by creating irreversible transformation that saves fifty thousand refugees and enables millions future colonists. Or that's her argument."

Zhang had made similar arguments in different contexts. Sacrificing some to save many. Military calculus. Command burden. The mathematics of triage.

"If Chen's right—if seven percent really is irreversible—then those twenty-six people are dying for permanent transformation. That's meaningful sacrifice."

"If she's wrong, they're dying for point zero one percent increase that The Gardener will reverse in the reversion protocol."

"Either way, they're dying. The meaning is what we assign after."

The tactical display updated. Three hours remaining. Chen's facilities glowing red on projection maps. Marsborn settlements evacuating in complex patterns. His third-wave shuttles fueling for post-disaster landing.

Everyone moving. Everyone calculating. Everyone hoping their bet on Mars' future was correct.

In three hours they'd know.

Kessa transmitted one final message to The Gardener. Seventy-three elements. Complex enough that she wasn't sure even she understood everything she was asking.

*I recognize your patience has limits. I recognize you've communicated clearly. I recognize humans have violated repeatedly. But I request consideration: The twenty-six staying in facilities—they're following Chen's orders, yes, but they're also acting from belief that completing transformation saves more lives than maintaining equilibrium. They're wrong. You and I know they're wrong. But they don't know the creators' history. Don't know completion causes extinction. From their perspective, they're heroes sacrificing for the greater good. When you enforce, when they die, please recognize they're not villains. They're desperate humans operating on incomplete information. Like the creators were. Like all species are. Please remember they died believing they were saving people. That should count for something.*

The response took eleven minutes. When it came, it was short. Eighteen elements.

*I recognize their belief. I recognize their sacrifice. I recognize all species operate on incomplete information. This does not change enforcement. Belief does not alter atmospheric chemistry. Sacrifice for flawed goals is still flaw. But I will note: they died for others. That is not meaningless. Even if the method was wrong. Enforcement proceeds. Memory honors intent even as consequence punishes action.*

It was as much compassion as planetary intelligence could offer.

Kessa would take it.

She sent messages to the twenty-six. Personal notes. Acknowledging their choice. Explaining what The Gardener had said. Telling them their intent would be remembered even if their method failed.

Fifteen of the twenty-six responded. Thanking her. Accepting their fate. Asking her to continue trying to bridge the gap they couldn't.

One engineer wrote: *Dying for what you believe is privilege. Most people don't get that. Tell The Gardener we understood. We just disagreed. That's the most honest foundation for war.*

Kessa recorded it. Saved it. Knew she'd never forget it.

Two hours forty-seven minutes remaining.

Atmospheric conversion: 6.945%.

Chen was going to reach her threshold. The twenty-six would die having technically succeeded.

The Gardener would enforce anyway.

And in twelve hours, Kessa would wake to casualty reports and atmospheric data and the weight of knowing she'd translated every word correctly but couldn't translate understanding into compliance.

First contact.

First communication.

First catastrophe.

The storm was coming.

Everyone knew it.

No one could stop it.

Kessa returned to her monitoring systems and waited for Mars to break.
