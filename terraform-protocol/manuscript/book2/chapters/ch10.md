# Chapter 10: The Day Before

*Day 2,428. One day before emergency meeting. Six days until deadline. Chen at 6.99%.*

The meeting was scheduled for dawn. Kessa spent the night before reviewing her presentation one final time—creator extinction data, biological adaptation curves, territorial division models, population mathematics. Everything that would either convince three hostile factions to accept limits or document their final refusal.

Sage sat nearby, monitoring Marsborn networks. "Seventeen settlements evacuating refugees to prepare for possible enforcement. They're choosing protection over compassion at the last minute."

"Can you blame them?"

"No. But it shows even Marsborn can't maintain limits when survival threatens. We're all the same when desperate."

The chamber lights pulsed. The Gardener, constant presence. Kessa transmitted: *Tomorrow's meeting—what outcome do you expect?*

The response: *Failure. Three factions with incompatible survival needs cannot agree to mutual limitation. But I will observe. Sometimes species surprise. Rarely, but sometimes.*

"That's the most optimistic thing it's ever said."

"It said 'rarely,'" Sage pointed out.

"Still qualifies as optimism from something that watched its creators die from the exact mistake humans are making."

Zhang's emergency landing operations had evacuated 4,000 more refugees in two days. Higher casualty rate than normal—68 dead from landing complications—but thousands saved from orbital starvation.

Supplies: five days remaining. Population in orbit: 39,000.

He'd be at the meeting tomorrow making demands he had no leverage to enforce, asking for concessions he had no right to expect, negotiating from desperation while pretending it was strategy.

"Sir," his operations officer reported. "Chen's atmospheric conversion just hit six point nine nine percent. She's one-tenth of one percent from cascade."

"How long until she reaches it?"

"At current rate? Twelve hours. She'll hit seven percent six hours before the meeting starts."

Zhang felt the weight of that timeline. Chen would arrive at negotiations having succeeded. Having reached irreversible cascade. Having made everyone's territorial arguments moot because the atmosphere would be transformed regardless of agreements.

Unless The Gardener enforced atmospheric reversion. Which would kill thousands.

"Contact Chen. Directly. Commander to faction leader."

The connection established. Chen's face on screen, exhausted but defiant.

"Admiral."

"Dr. Chen. You're twelve hours from cascade. If you reach it before the meeting, you make negotiation impossible. The Gardener will have to enforce reversion or accept your transformation. Either outcome is catastrophic."

"Or The Gardener accepts territorial division and my cascade doesn't matter. The completed zones support refugees. Everyone survives."

"You're betting thousands of lives that it accepts."

"You're betting thousands that it doesn't. We're both making desperate calculations, Zhang. Don't pretend your refugee landings are different from my atmospheric acceleration. We're using the same logic. Survive first, negotiate after."

Zhang couldn't argue. She was right.

"If you halt production for six hours," he said carefully. "If you reach the meeting at six point nine nine instead of seven point zero zero, it shows willingness to stop short of cascade. Shows The Gardener we can limit ourselves."

"Six hours costs me everything if the meeting fails. I reach cascade or I don't. There's no partial credit."

"There's proving we can choose limits before being forced. That's what The Gardener needs to see."

Chen was quiet for long moment. Then: "I'll consider it. No promises."

The connection cut.

Zhang transmitted update to Kessa: *Chen might halt short of cascade. Might show restraint. It's something.*

Kessa's response: *It's more than I expected. Thank you for trying.*

Chen stood in her command center, watching atmospheric conversion tick upward. 6.993%. Hours from cascade. Hours from irreversibility. Hours from succeeding at seven years of work.

And Zhang was asking her to stop.

Not for humanitarian reasons. Not for safety. For symbolism. To prove humanity could choose limits.

Her chief engineer waited for orders. "Ma'am? Do we halt or continue?"

Chen thought about the 315 dead. The twenty-six who'd stayed at facilities. The eighty-seven Marsborn who'd testified through oxygen toxicity. All the casualties of transformation.

Thought about the creators—ancient aliens who'd completed their terraforming and died. Who'd proven transformation could succeed and still destroy the species that achieved it.

Thought about tomorrow's meeting. Three factions. One planetary intelligence. Territorial division or enforcement. Compliance or catastrophe.

"Halt production," she said. "At six point nine nine percent. We arrive at the meeting showing we can stop short of cascade. If negotiation succeeds, we reach cascade through agreement. If it fails, we resume and hit seven percent with or without approval."

"That's... strategic restraint?"

"That's gambling that Zhang's right—that The Gardener values our capacity for limits more than it fears our success. We show we can stop. Then we negotiate whether stopping is necessary."

The order transmitted. Production facilities began controlled shutdown. Atmospheric conversion stabilized at 6.994%.

Chen would arrive at the meeting 0.006% short of cascade.

Close enough to demonstrate capability. Far enough to demonstrate choice.

It was the best compromise she could offer.

Tomorrow would prove if it was enough.

---

Kessa received Chen's decision at midnight. Halt at 6.994%. Strategic restraint.

She transmitted to The Gardener: *Chen stopped short of cascade. Zhang coordinated the request. Marsborn are stabilizing populations. All three factions demonstrating limited capacity for self-limitation. Does this change your assessment of tomorrow's meeting?*

The response took three minutes: *Marginal change. Demonstrates tactical restraint, not philosophical acceptance of limits. But tactics are improvement over blind acceleration. I will attend with increased—not optimism. Increased willingness to observe carefully. Meeting outcome still uncertain but not predetermined. This is progress.*

"It said progress," Kessa told Sage. "The Gardener acknowledged human progress."

"Don't celebrate yet. 'Not predetermined failure' is pretty low bar."

"Low bar is better than no bar."

Kessa returned to her presentation. Added Chen's halt decision. Framed it as evidence that humanity could choose limits when motivated. Built the argument that tomorrow's meeting was proof of capacity for negotiation.

And hoped six days from now, she wouldn't be documenting the failure of that argument.

Six days until deadline.

One day until meeting.

One-tenth of one percent separating cascade from restraint.

And somewhere in all that narrow space between catastrophe and cooperation, maybe—barely—a path where everyone survived.

Tomorrow they'd find out.

Kessa tried to sleep.

Failed.

Spent the remaining hours reviewing data and hoping her translation of alien intelligence into human politics was accurate enough to matter.

Because if it wasn't, The Gardener's "increased willingness to observe" would become "implementation of enforcement."

And 2,000-4,000 more casualties would be added to the 315 already dead.

The meeting tomorrow would determine which.

Kessa returned to her preparation.

Last chance to get it right.

Last chance for humanity to prove it could share a world.

Last chance for first contact to mean something other than first war.

Dawn was coming.

So was the emergency meeting.

So was the final negotiation.

So was proof that understanding without compliance was just elaborate theater before inevitable catastrophe.

Unless.

Unless three desperate factions could agree.

Unless territorial division could work.

Unless species could share planets.

Unless humans could accept limits.

Unless the meeting succeeded.

Big unless.

But the only one remaining.

Kessa prepared for dawn.
