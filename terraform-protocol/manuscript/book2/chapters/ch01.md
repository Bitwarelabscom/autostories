# Chapter 1: Divided Ground

The transport from Valles Marineris to Olympus Mons took four hours, and Kessa spent most of it watching Mars tear itself apart.

Not literally. Not yet. But through the transport's small viewport, she could see the signs. The southern hemisphere glowed with an unnatural shimmer where Dr. Chen's faction had tripled the nanite deployment. The atmospheric processors near Hellas Basin were running at 140% capacity, pumping oxygen and nitrogen into air that The Gardener had maintained for two million years. And high above, barely visible against the stars, the refugee fleet had descended from high orbit to low—Zhang Wei's ships positioning themselves for landing operations that Mars had neither authorized nor prepared for.

Four weeks since the Emergency Colonial Council. Four weeks since the message that had divided Mars into three incompatible futures. Four weeks of watching the compromise she'd hoped for fracture into open conflict.

"You're really going back there," Sage said beside her. Not a question. They'd been arguing about it for three days, and now they were just stating facts.

"Someone has to."

"Someone already did. Dmitri's team. Rajesh. Dr. Chen. All dead. The Gardener doesn't want us in its structure."

"The Gardener didn't want us attacking it with explosives. That's different from communicating." Kessa pulled up her tablet, reviewing the equipment manifest for the twentieth time. "Look at the pattern. Every time we approached peacefully, it modulated its response. When Dmitri's team brought mining charges, it escalated. When I retreated after the first seismic event, it decreased activity. It's not mindless. It's responding to intent."

"Or you're seeing patterns in chaos because you need there to be a solution."

That hit closer than Kessa wanted to admit. "Maybe. But the alternative is war between three factions and a planetary intelligence. I'd rather die trying to find another way than watch another Olympus Station."

The transport shuddered as it crossed into the northern hemisphere. The pilot—a Marsborn named Keiko who'd volunteered for this mission despite knowing it might be one-way—adjusted course to avoid a weather system that hadn't existed ten minutes ago.

"Atmospheric anomaly over Tharsis," Keiko called back. "The Gardener's getting more active. Probably responding to Chen's southern hemisphere deployment."

"How bad?" Sage asked.

"Localized. Pressure differentials, some electrical activity. Nothing like Olympus Station. Yet."

Kessa watched the storm form and dissipate in minutes. The Gardener flexing, showing it was watching. Showing it could respond. A warning, not an attack. That distinction mattered, even if no one else seemed to see it.

Her tablet buzzed with incoming messages. She'd made the mistake of checking the colonial networks this morning and now couldn't stop.

**From: Dr. Vashti Chen, Continuist Coalition**
*Okafor—Your "communication project" delays necessary action. We've reached 6.2% atmospheric conversion. Another seven weeks at current acceleration puts us past reversibility. The Gardener will have to accept the new equilibrium. Stop interfering with progress. —VC*

**From: Admiral Zhang Wei, Refugee Fleet Command**
*Dr. Okafor. Supplies: 33 days remaining. I understand your position but mine is simple—my people are dying. Landing operations begin in 48 hours with or without colonial approval. I regret this necessity. Coordinates shared separately for your safety. —Admiral Zhang*

**From: Councilor Reeves, Hellas Basin Settlement**
*Dr. Okafor: Hellas Basin formally requesting Marsborn security assistance against potential refugee landings. Your faction's neutrality is untenable. Choose a side. —CR*

She closed the tablet before the nausea could set in. Everyone demanding she choose: accelerate terraforming, defend refugees, protect Marsborn. As if those were the only options. As if understanding wasn't possible.

"Thirty-three days," Sage said, reading over her shoulder despite Kessa's attempt at privacy. "Zhang's running out of time."

"I know."

"And Chen's at 6.2%. Another percentage point triggers cascade effects. The atmospheric composition starts self-reinforcing."

"I know."

"And my people—" Sage's voice hardened, "—are being asked to choose between accepting refugees who'll doom Mars or watching fifty thousand people die in orbit."

"I. Know." Kessa looked at Sage, at the young Marsborn who'd somehow become her partner in this impossible task. "That's why I'm going into The Gardener's structure. That's why you're coming with me. Because we have maybe three weeks before these factions make choices that can't be unmade."

"Three weeks to decode an alien intelligence that's maintained a planet for two million years. That's optimistic even for you."

"I'm not optimistic. I'm desperate. That's different."

The transport descended toward the Olympus Mons research station—what remained of it. The main facility was still intact, though sections had been damaged by the seismic events that destroyed the colony proper. Temporary structures sprawled around it like scar tissue, housing scientists and salvage crews and the morbidly curious who wanted to see where eleven hundred people had died.

Kessa's breath caught as the landing site came into view. She'd seen the footage, read the reports, but witnessing the crater where Olympus Station had been—that was different. Three kilometers of colony infrastructure, simply gone. Collapsed into sinkholes or pulverized by localized quakes or suffocated by atmospheric correction events. The Gardener had destroyed an entire settlement in seventy-three minutes.

And she was going to walk into its heart and try to talk to it.

"Still think this is a good idea?" Sage asked quietly.

"No. But I'm out of good ideas. This is just the least catastrophic one."

The transport touched down with a bump that sent red dust billowing around them. Through the viewport, Kessa could see the research station's entrance—the same entrance she'd used six months ago when this was just an archaeological curiosity. Before The Gardener woke. Before Olympus Station. Before everything broke.

Dr. Yuki Tanaka was waiting at the airlock, pressure suit pristine despite the dust. She'd been the station director before the disaster and had somehow convinced the Emergency Council to let her stay and coordinate what remained of the research efforts. Kessa suspected it was less about scientific merit and more about no one else wanting the job.

"Dr. Okafor. Sage." Yuki's bow was precise even through the suit. "Your equipment arrived yesterday. I've had it moved to the descent chamber. Along with supplies for two weeks, though I hope you'll reconsider the timeline."

"Two weeks is all we have before Zhang starts landing," Kessa said, stepping out into the thin Martian atmosphere. Her breathing mask engaged automatically, supplementing oxygen. Sage, of course, didn't need one—their adapted lungs handled Mars' air as easily as Kessa's handled Earth's, once upon a time.

"I'm aware of Admiral Zhang's plans. I'm also aware that The Gardener has increased seismic activity by 40% in the past week. It knows something is coming." Yuki gestured toward the station entrance. "Walk with me. There's something you should see before you go down."

The station was quieter than Kessa remembered. Most of the research staff had evacuated or been reassigned to the factions. Only a skeleton crew remained, monitoring The Gardener's activity and maintaining the access shaft that led two kilometers down into Mars' mantle.

Yuki led them to a monitoring station covered in seismograph readings, atmospheric sensor data, and electromagnetic mapping. But she pointed to none of those. Instead, she pulled up a simple audio file.

"We recorded this three days ago. Low-frequency vibrations from the structure, translated into audible range."

She played it.

At first, Kessa heard only noise. Rumbles and groans that could have been tectonic settling. Then—there. A pattern. A sequence that repeated with variations. Not random. Not mechanical.

*Purpose.*

"It's trying to communicate," Kessa whispered.

"Or it's preparing a defense protocol," Yuki said. "The pattern began after Zhang's fleet descended to low orbit. It could be a warning. Or a targeting sequence."

"Play it again."

Yuki complied. Kessa closed her eyes, letting the sound wash over her. She'd spent fifteen years deciphering dead languages from dead civilizations. This was different—alive, immediate, dangerous—but the fundamental challenge was the same. Find the structure. Find the grammar. Find the meaning.

The sequence had seven distinct elements. Each element repeated with slight variations. Elements two and five seemed linked—when one changed, the other changed proportionally. Element seven always came last, like punctuation.

A language. Or the skeleton of one.

"Can you isolate the elements?" she asked. "Let me analyze the variations?"

"Already done." Yuki transferred files to Kessa's tablet. "Also compiled every seismic and atmospheric event for the past six months, cross-referenced with The Gardener's responses. If there's a pattern, it's in there."

"Thank you."

"Don't thank me. Just—" Yuki hesitated, then: "Just come back alive. I've lost too many colleagues already. I don't want to add you to the list."

"I'll try."

"Trying isn't enough. Be careful. Be smart. And if The Gardener gives you any indication it wants you out—get out. Don't be a hero."

Kessa thought about Dmitri, who'd been a hero by his own definition and died anyway. About Rajesh, who'd just wanted to understand and got crushed for his curiosity. About eleven hundred people who'd died because humans and The Gardener were speaking different languages.

"I'm not a hero," she said. "I'm a translator. That's all I've ever been."

The descent chamber was exactly as she remembered—a converted mining lift that dropped two kilometers straight down into the structure. The equipment Yuki mentioned was already loaded: ground-penetrating radar, seismic sensors, atmospheric samplers, emergency supplies, medical kit, and enough climbing gear to get them out if the lift failed.

Also: Sage's personal addition. A hand-painted sign that read "HERE FOR CONVERSATION NOT CONFRONTATION" in three languages including Mandarin and Arabic for Zhang's refugees.

"Think The Gardener reads English?" Sage asked, checking their own equipment.

"I think The Gardener reads intent. But it can't hurt."

They loaded into the lift. Kessa's hands were steady as she activated the descent sequence, but her heartbeat wasn't. Two kilometers down into an alien intelligence that had killed eleven hundred people. To try to communicate before three desperate factions forced a war that would kill thousands more.

The lift began to descend. Mars' surface disappeared above them, replaced by ancient stone and crystalline formations that glowed with bioluminescent light. The Gardener's structure—vast, intricate, impossible.

Somewhere in this depth, an intelligence waited. Judging. Calculating. Deciding if humanity was symbiotic or parasitic. Deciding if Mars had room for two species of gardener.

Kessa pulled up the audio pattern on her tablet and began to analyze. She had two weeks to learn a language that had no human referents. Two weeks to bridge a gap between biological and silicon life. Two weeks to find a third option before desperation forced terrible choices.

The lift descended into darkness, and Kessa got to work.

Above them, Mars fractured further. Chen's faction accelerated nanite deployment. Zhang's fleet prepared landing shuttles. Marsborn communities fortified their settlements. Each faction convinced their path was right, their cause justified, their survival paramount.

None of them knew if Kessa would succeed or fail. But they knew, with terrible certainty, what would happen if she didn't try.

War. Not between nations or corporations. Between humanity and a world that had learned, two million years ago, that sometimes the only way to survive was to stop the gardeners before they finished their work.

The lift stopped at the chamber's base. Two kilometers down, surrounded by alien architecture that predated human civilization by epochs.

Kessa took a breath, adjusted her equipment, and stepped out into The Gardener's domain.

"Okay," she said to Sage, to herself, to the intelligence watching from every surface. "Let's talk."

The Gardener's lights pulsed once—acknowledgment or warning, she couldn't tell yet.

But it was a start.
