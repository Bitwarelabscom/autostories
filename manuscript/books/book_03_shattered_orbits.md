# Book 3: Shattered Orbits
## The Hegemony Saga
### Years 3000-3010

## SUMMARY

The fragile peace shatters when Marcus and Sienna return from the outer civilizations with news of illegal AI development by the Transit Authority. As the Hegemony faces external threats and internal fractures, Generation 2 must choose between preserving the past and embracing a dangerous future. The cost is high: Thane dies heroically, Cassandra reveals decades of secrets, and the gate system itself proves to be more than anyone imagined.

## CLIMACTIC SCENE: Cassandra's Deathbed

Cassandra lay in the medical bay on Celestia Prime, surrounded by her children. At seventy-two, the longevity treatments could only do so much when the heart simply didn't want to beat anymore.

"Mother, please," Victoria whispered, holding her hand.

"Darling girl," Cassandra smiled weakly. "I'm tired. I've been tired since Thane died." She looked at Marcus and Sienna on the other side of the bed. "My impossible children."

"We're here," Marcus said, voice thick.

"I need to tell you something. Both of you." Cassandra drew a shaky breath. "I wasted thirty years measuring love against duty. Chose duty. It nearly killed me. Then I got five years with Thane—five years of actual happiness—before the universe took him too."

"Rest, Mother," Sienna said softly.

"No. Listen." Cassandra squeezed their hands with surprising strength. "You two. You've spent twenty-five years finding ways to love each other within impossible constraints. That's not tragedy. That's triumph."

"Mother—"

"Don't waste your lives wishing for what you can't have. You have something real. Something honest. Don't let anyone tell you it's not enough." Cassandra's eyes were bright. "Love however you can. Family is what you make it. And you two have made something beautiful from impossible circumstances."

She closed her eyes. "Victoria, you and Zara—be happy. Openly. Defiantly. Don't hide like I did."

"I won't," Victoria promised through tears.

"Marcus, you're a better leader than your father dreamed. Sienna, you're stronger than you know. Together..." Cassandra smiled. "Together you've changed everything. I'm so proud."

Her breathing slowed. Stopped.

The beeping of the monitors flatlined.

And Cassandra Ashford-Rourke, who'd spent thirty years in a loveless marriage and five years in joy, died surrounded by the family she'd helped heal.

## EPILOGUE

The funeral was massive. Cassandra was honored as a reformer, a bridge-builder, a woman who'd helped transform the Hegemony from rigid aristocracy to something more fluid and humane.

Marcus stood at her memorial and spoke of his mother's courage. Victoria wept openly with Zara at her side. Sienna placed flowers at the memorial—for the stepmother who'd welcomed her when she could have rejected her.

That night, Marcus and Sienna sat on the observation deck where Lysander had once stood calculating.

"Your mother was right," Sienna said quietly. "We have built something. Not what we imagined at twenty-eight. But something real."

"Yes." Marcus took her hand—familial touch they'd learned to share without longing. "I wouldn't trade what we have now for the impossible romance we wanted."

"Liar," Sienna said, but gently.

"Okay, maybe I'd trade it. But I don't regret our choices anymore."

They sat in comfortable silence, watching the stars. Two people who'd loved each other across impossible divides and found a way to make that love into something sustainable, if not simple.

Generation 1 was gone. Generation 2 was aging. Generation 3 was rising.

And the Hegemony was transforming into something none of them had predicted.
