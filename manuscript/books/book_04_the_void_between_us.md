## SUMMARY

## MAJOR SCENE: The Sisters Confront Their Mother

"You knew," Katerina said coldly. "How long did you know before you told us?"

Sienna sat in her quarters on The Obsidian, facing both her daughters—legitimate Katerina and secretly-conceived Terra Cross. Both women she loved. Both women she'd hurt.

"Three days," Sienna admitted. "I discovered your relationship and spent three days trying to find another explanation before accepting the truth."

"Three days while we—" Terra Cross couldn't finish, face flushing with shame and rage.

"I know. I'm sorry."

"Sorry?" Katerina's laugh was bitter. "You created me through conventional means and Terra through artificial conception, never told anyone you'd had another daughter, let us meet and fall in love, and you're *sorry*?"

"I didn't know you'd meet. Didn't know you'd—" Sienna's voice broke. "I'm not defending it. I'm explaining."

"Why did you even create another child?" Terra Cross demanded. "Was I a backup? In case the legitimate Ashford daughter didn't work out?"

"No! I created you because after losing Marcus, I wanted something that was just mine. A daughter I could raise my way, without aristocratic interference." Sienna looked at Terra Cross with anguish. "Rafe raised you while I was exploring the outer civilizations. You were loved. Wanted."

"But secret," Terra Cross said. "Like everything else in this cursed family."

"Yes," Sienna admitted. "I repeated my father's mistakes. Had a child I didn't publicly acknowledge. I'm sorry."

Katerina stood, pacing like a caged predator. "We're half-sisters. We—gods, we slept together. Multiple times. How do we live with that?"

"The same way Marcus and I lived with discovering we were siblings after falling in love," Sienna said quietly. "You find a way forward."

"By becoming cold, distant colleagues who pretend they don't break every time they see each other?" Katerina's voice dripped venom. "What a wonderful model of healing."

The words hit Sienna like physical blows. "We did our best with an impossible situation."

"Your best destroyed us," Terra Cross said flatly. "Just like your relationship with Marcus destroyed both of you."

Both daughters left without another word, leaving Sienna alone with the consequences of secrets kept too long.

She'd repeated Lysander's mistake. Created hidden children. Let love become tragedy.

The Ashford curse lived on.

## EPILOGUE

Marcus found Sienna that night, staring at the stars like Lysander used to.

"I heard," he said gently.

"I destroyed my daughters' happiness. Just like your father destroyed ours."

"Sienna—"

"Don't defend it. Don't excuse it." She turned to him. "We spent thirty years building something beautiful from impossible circumstances. And our children looked at it and saw tragedy. Not triumph. Tragedy."

"Maybe they're not wrong," Marcus admitted. "Maybe we told ourselves a beautiful story about making the best of things, when really we were just... enduring."

Sienna felt something crack in her chest. "Marcus, don't. Please. If what we built wasn't real—"

"It was real. It is real." He took her hands. "But maybe it's also sad. Both things can be true."

They stood together, two people in their sixties who'd loved each other for forty years across impossible divides, and wondered if they'd been heroes or cautionary tales.

Generation 3 would have to answer that.
