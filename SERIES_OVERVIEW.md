## AUTHOR'S NOTE

*The Hegemony Saga* is a story about love, legacy, and the stubborn human insistence on connection despite impossible barriers.

It begins with Lysander Ashford, a cold man who controlled everything and loved nothing.

It ends with his great-great-granddaughter Isabella, who learned to love across forms of existence.

In between: four generations of Ashfords learned that duty and love aren't opposites, that patterns can be broken (slowly), and that humanity is more flexible than we imagine.

It's messy. It's painful. It's occasionally ridiculous.

It's human.

And that's the point.

---

## FINAL THOUGHTS

These ten books span:
- 100 years of future history
- 5 generations of characters
- The transformation of civilization from aristocratic hegemony to hybrid confederation
- Countless forbidden romances, political betrayals, and moments of grace

But at its heart, it's about this:

**Love anyway.**

Across class barriers.
Across biological kinship.
Across enemy lines.
Across forms of existence.

**Love anyway.**

That's the Ashford legacy.

And maybe, it's worth emulating.

*Thank you for reading The Hegemony Saga*

*May your loves be slightly less impossible than the Ashfords'*
*(Though equally passionate)*
