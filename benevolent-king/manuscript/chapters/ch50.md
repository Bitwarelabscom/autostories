# Chapter 50: Corporate Panic

The emergency Corporate Council meeting was tense. 'Labor costs up 40%. Productivity demands met with organized resistance. Work stoppages spreading. We're losing control.' Chair Volkov reviewed the data. Grim. 'How did one drug dealer create this much disruption?' 'He didn't. He created the spark. Workers organized themselves.' 'Then we crush the organization.' 'How? Arrest four thousand workers? Fire everyone? The station stops functioning.' The Council had no answers. Negotiation felt like surrender. Violence felt like catastrophe. Doing nothing meant slow erosion of power. They were trapped. And they knew it. The revolution wasn't violent. Wasn't dramatic. Just inevitable. Workers realizing they had power. Using it. Corporate's worst nightmare. Coming true.
