# Chapter 42: Assets Frozen

The asset freeze hit at dawn. Three million credits, locked. Every account Nico controlled, frozen simultaneously. Corporate had moved fast after his refusal. He had maybe 200K in hidden accounts. Physical cash stashed in safe houses. Not enough to keep the operation running. Not nearly enough. Maya brought the news: 'Cooperatives are asking what to do. They need startup capital.' 'Tell them we're pivoting. No more charity. Loans only. Revolving fund.' 'With what money?' 'Whatever we can scrape together.' Lin organized an emergency meeting. Twelve cooperative leaders. 'Corporate thinks freezing Nico's assets breaks us. They're wrong. We build without him.' And they did. Cooperative #8 loaned startup capital to Cooperative #14. Member dues created micro-funds. The network began sustaining itself. Slower. Messier. But real. Nico watched from hiding, becoming unnecessary. Exactly as planned. Exactly as terrifying.
