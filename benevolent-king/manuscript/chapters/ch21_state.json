  "notes": "First tentpole of Book 2. Three-year time jump establishes new status quo: Nico's operation is successful and transformative, but this success has made him a target. Corporate Council chapter shows the opposition organizing, framing the central conflict of Book 2. Key themes: temporary good vs systemic change, individual charity creating economic disruption, the burden of being needed by thousands. Character growth: Nico more exhausted and defensive, Maya more radical and committed, Kade more damaged, Lin pragmatically supportive, Wright patient and calculating. Sets up economic war between Nico and upper tiers. Money countdown begins in earnest. Arc position 0.55 for Nico - growth but also new problems emerging."
