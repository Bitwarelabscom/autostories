  "notes": "Bridge chapter connecting Ch 1's job offer to Ch 3's investigation of the core. Shows Nico's desperation and moral flexibility - he steals despite warning, rationalizing it. Introduces the data core that will change everything. Park's background established: accountant for Covenant Holdings, careful man who hid something important. Kade's warning about danger goes unheeded. Nico's arc barely moves (0.02) - he's still the same person making questionable choices out of desperation. The 'possibility' Nico feels at the end is dangerous hope - the hook that pulls him forward. Sensory details of Level 8's grimmer sections and the sad aftermath of a lonely death ground the chapter in the world's bleakness."
