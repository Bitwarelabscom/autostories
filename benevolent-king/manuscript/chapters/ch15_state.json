  "notes": "Fourth tentpole chapter (COMPLICATION). Success breeds danger - the charity works, which makes it threatening to institutional power. Introduces Specialist Tanaka as investigative antagonist (precursor to Wright). Kade's warnings show the operation's vulnerability. Maya's decision to help is major character moment - she's choosing Nico and the work over her institutional loyalty. Nico experiences pride for first time, making the stakes emotional not just practical. Key tension: can they maintain this good work while authorities circle? Arc position rises to 0.45 - Nico is now committed and has allies, but faces serious external threats. The 'warning shot' as Kade says - foreshadows Book 1's climax where institutional power will confront him directly."
