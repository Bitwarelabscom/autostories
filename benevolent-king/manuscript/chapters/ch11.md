# Chapter 11: Free Friday

The line started forming at 0800 hours, three hours before Chen's Noodle House was supposed to open.

Nico knew because he'd spent the night in the restaurant's back room, half-asleep on a cot Mrs. Chen kept for the occasions she worked too late to go home. He'd been too drunk and high to navigate back to his pod, and besides, the restaurant was his now. Sort of. The transfer paperwork was still processing, but he'd paid the fifty thousand deposit and Mrs. Chen had given him the access codes.

He owned a restaurant. The thought still felt surreal.

The noise from outside woke him—voices, lots of them, muffled through the restaurant's thin walls. Nico rolled off the cot, his head pounding, mouth tasting like something had died in it. The Veil had worn off, leaving him with the familiar hollow ache and the less-familiar weight of having made a massively public decision while intoxicated.

He stumbled to the front windows and looked out.

"Oh, fuck."

There had to be fifty people in line. Maybe more. They stretched down the corridor, past the fabrication shop, past the pod hotels, disappearing around the corner into District Five. Old people, young people, families with kids. All of them quiet, patient, waiting.

Waiting for him.

"Kid, you seeing this?"

Nico jumped. Kade stood in the doorway, holding two cups of something hot that smelled like synthetic coffee. His expression was caught between amused and concerned.

"When did you—"

"About twenty minutes ago. Got your message." Kade handed him a cup, leaned against the doorframe. "You really announced free meals to a packed restaurant last night, huh?"

"Yeah." Nico sipped the coffee. It was terrible. He'd never been more grateful for anything. "That was... that was stupid, yeah?"

"Epically stupid." Kade looked out at the line. "Also might be the best thing you've ever done. Can't decide yet."

"I bought a restaurant while drunk and high."

"You did."

"And told everyone meals would be free."

"You did that too."

"Kade, I don't know how to run a restaurant."

"Does Mrs. Chen?"

"She's been running this place for thirty years!"

"Then I guess you better learn fast, kid." Kade whistled tunelessly, studying the growing crowd. "You got food for all these people?"

Nico hadn't thought about that. Hadn't thought about anything beyond the moment of defiant generosity. "I... don't know. Maybe?"

"Better check inventory. And you're going to need staff. Chen run this place solo?"

"She had two people. Kitchen staff. They quit when she put it up for sale."

"So you got no cooks, no servers, no idea what you're doing, and about seventy people out there who are going to be very disappointed if you don't feed them." Kade's smile was sharp. "Welcome to charity work."

"Fuck." Nico set down his coffee, ran his hands through his hair. "Okay. Okay. I can... I need to check the kitchen, see what we have. And I need to find people who know how to cook, fast. And—"

"And you need to open the doors before there's a riot." Kade pushed off the doorframe. "I'll help. I can't cook worth shit, but I can manage a line. And you're going to owe me, kid. Big time."

"I already owe you five hundred thousand."

"Now it's six." Kade moved toward the door, then paused. "Just so we're clear—this is insane. You just painted a target on yourself the size of a fucking shuttle. Every gang in Level 8 is going to want a piece of this. SSS is going to notice eventually. And you're running a restaurant with money you stole from a dead guy."

"I know."

"Just making sure." Kade unlocked the front door, propped it open. "Alright, people! Restaurant opens in one hour! One bowl per person, first come first served, and if anyone starts shit, you're all going hungry!"

The crowd murmured, shifted, but stayed orderly. Nico watched them through the window—really looked at them for maybe the first time.

He knew some of the faces. Mrs. Huang from his corner, looking frailer than he remembered. The teenager from Pod Block C who was always asking for credit. A maintenance worker he'd sold to occasionally, still in his work jumpsuit, probably came straight from night shift. Families. So many families with kids.

When had Level 8 gotten this many kids?

When had they all looked this hungry?

Nico tore himself away from the window, headed to the kitchen. The space was small but functional—two cooking stations, a large pot for broth, storage for noodles and vegetables. He pulled up the inventory on the kitchen terminal.

Enough noodles for maybe a hundred bowls. Broth base for another fifty. Vegetables running low.

Seventy people outside and more coming.

He'd need more supplies. A lot more supplies. And cooks. And—

His tablet buzzed. A message from a number he didn't recognize: *Heard you need kitchen help. I can cook. Name's Jian, I worked at Chen's three years ago. When do I start?*

Nico stared at the message. Then another came in: *This is Mara. I waitressed at Chen's before the kids. I can work mornings. Free meals for my family?*

Then another: *Lee here. Dishwashing, prep work, whatever you need. My partner's sick, can't work. Need food more than wages.*

They were volunteering. People were volunteering to help him run a charity restaurant because they needed the help themselves.

Nico's throat tightened. He typed back to all three: *Yes. Come now. Wages plus meals.*

Within twenty minutes, he had a staff. Jian showed up first—a woman in her forties with scarred hands and a no-nonsense expression. She took one look at the kitchen, nodded, and started prepping without asking questions. Mara arrived with two kids in tow, settled them at a back table with coloring pads, and began organizing the dining room. Lee came last, a thin young guy who immediately started washing dishes that didn't need washing, nervous energy looking for outlet.

"Okay," Jian said, tying back her hair. "Standard noodle bowl—broth, vegetables, noodles, protein if we've got it. Keep it simple, keep it moving. You got money for supplies?"

"Yeah. Whatever we need."

"Then I'll make a list. Lee, you're on supply run once the crowd clears. Mara, you're managing the line—one bowl per person, keep it orderly. Nico—" She looked at him. "You're going to stand in that dining room and show your face. These people need to see you're serious."

"I don't—"

"You made the promise. Now you keep it." Jian turned back to her prep. "Welcome to the food service industry, boss. Try not to fuck it up."

---

They opened at 1100 hours.

The first person through the door was an old man Nico vaguely recognized from District Six. He looked at the menu board—which now just said FREE MEAL in hand-painted letters—then at Nico, then back at the board.

"For real?" the old man asked.

"For real," Nico said. "One bowl, hot and fresh. No charge."

The old man's eyes watered. He nodded, moved to a table, sat down with the careful dignity of someone who hadn't had enough to eat in a long time.

Jian brought out the first bowl—steaming noodles in rich broth, vegetables colorful against the pale strands. She set it down in front of the old man with a slight bow.

He picked up the chopsticks with shaking hands and ate.

The line moved. One person, then another, then another. Nico stood by the door, watching them come in. Watching them eat.

He'd lived in Level 8 his whole adult life. Had dealt drugs here, used here, survived here. He'd thought he knew what poverty looked like.

He hadn't known shit.

The woman who cried while eating, trying to hide her face. The father who split his bowl to share with his two kids before Mara brought out more. The maintenance worker who fell asleep at his table, bowl empty, looking more peaceful than Nico had ever seen him.

The teenager who asked, voice barely audible, if there might be seconds.

"Yeah," Nico told her. "Yeah, there's seconds."

They fed seventy-three people that first day. Ran out of supplies by 1400 hours, sent Lee on an emergency run with five thousand credits to buy more from the Level 7 suppliers. Fed another forty after that.

By the time they closed at 1800, Nico's feet hurt, his head was pounding, and he'd seen more gratitude in six hours than in his entire life combined.

Kade helped him lock up, count the remaining supplies, pay the staff. Jian accepted her wages with a nod, told him she'd be back tomorrow, asked if he wanted her to bring her sister who used to run a supply chain for Station Maintenance.

"Yes," Nico said immediately. "Yes, bring her."

When everyone had left, Kade and Nico stood in the empty restaurant. It smelled like food and people and something Nico couldn't quite name. Something warm.

"Hundred and thirteen people," Kade said. "First day. Word's going to spread, kid. Tomorrow'll be double. Maybe triple."

"I got the money."

"It's not about the money." Kade looked at him. "You know what you did today?"

"Fed some people?"

"You gave them hope." Kade's voice was soft. "That's more dangerous than the money. Hope makes people do crazy shit. Makes them believe things could be different. Makes them expect more."

"Is that bad?"

"I don't know yet." Kade pulled out a cigarette, lit it even though smoking was technically illegal inside. "But you better be ready for what comes next. Because this—" He gestured at the restaurant. "This is just the beginning."

Nico looked around the empty room. Saw the clean tables waiting for tomorrow. The kitchen prepped for the next service. The line that would form again at 0800, and the day after that, and the day after that.

He'd bought a restaurant on impulse while drunk and high, and somehow it had become something real. Something that mattered.

"Yeah," Nico said quietly. "I'm ready."

He wasn't. Not even close. But he'd figure it out.

He had to.

Because for the first time in nine years, people were depending on him for something other than their next hit.

And Nico Chen was done failing people.
