# Chapter 43: The Warrant

The arrest warrant was comprehensive. 'Nico Chen, wanted for criminal conspiracy, theft, incitement to violence, forty-seven counts of negligent homicide. Armed and dangerous. 500,000 credit reward for information leading to arrest.' Armed and dangerous. Nico laughed bitterly. He hadn't touched a weapon in years. But truth didn't matter. Narrative did. SSS raids intensified. Every known associate questioned. Every safe house searched. Anyone caught helping him faced twenty years mandatory. The operation had to continue without his visible involvement. Lin became the public face. Maya coordinated medical networks. Anonymous donors funded cooperatives. Nico became a ghost. A legend. A symbol. Not a person anymore. Just an idea that refused to die. Even when Corporate was hunting the man who'd embodied it.
