  "notes": "Maya's transformation chapter. Title 'Maya's Dilemma' captures her impossible choice: follow rules (lose Nico's good work) or break rules (lose her life's work). Her confrontation with Sarah reveals systemic double standards—upper-tier crimes ignored, lower-tier prosecuted. Maya's arc 0.35 shows her radicalization beginning. She's been working within broken system for years; now chooses to break out. Nico's resignation ('file the report') shows his fatalism—doesn't believe he's worth saving. But Maya sees bigger picture: what he's doing matters even if temporary. Her line 'the people you're feeding are worth it' reframes his worth through collective impact. She buys him 1-2 months by stalling. The detail about Nico looking thinner, exhausted shows physical toll. Maya's final thought—first time in 15 years she feels like she's actually helping—captures her disillusionment with social services and her growing radicalism. Sets up her full joining of operation in Book 2."
