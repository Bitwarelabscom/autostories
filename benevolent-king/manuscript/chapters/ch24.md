# Chapter 24: Labor Shortage

Director Chen Wei's morning briefing made it clear: the station was falling apart.

"Waste processing is at 67% capacity," his operations manager reported. "We need forty-two more workers to maintain baseline service."

"Hire them."

"We've posted the positions. No one's applying. The pay is standard Level 6 wage—"

"Which is garbage compared to sitting on your ass in Level 8 eating free noodles," Chen Wei interrupted. "I'm aware of the problem."

The manager hesitated. "Actually, sir, it's not just Level 8 anymore. Applications are down across Levels 7 and 9 as well. People are... choosing not to work."

"Choosing?" Chen Wei's voice went dangerous. "They're choosing to stay unemployed? What the hell are they living on?"

"Each other, from what we can tell. Mutual aid networks. Shared housing. Informal economy. Chen's operation showed them they could survive without taking shit jobs."

"Chen's operation is broke. They can't keep funding—"

"They're not funding it anymore. The networks are self-sustaining. People helping people without a benefactor." The manager pulled up data. "Last month, Level 8 had thirty-seven informal food cooperatives operating. Not Chen's restaurants. Just neighbors pooling resources, cooking collectively, sharing costs."

Chen Wei stared at the numbers. "They're organizing."

"Yes sir. And it's spreading. We're seeing similar patterns in Level 7. Even some Level 6 workers are asking why they're working sixty hours a week when they could work thirty and cooperate."

"Because," Chen Wei said through gritted teeth, "thirty hours doesn't pay rent."

"Neither does sixty hours if rent keeps increasing. Sir, we've pushed wages down for so long that work isn't covering basic survival. People are doing the math."

The briefing room fell silent.

Somewhere in Level 8, Nico Chen was probably high on Veil, granting petitions like a feudal lord. But he'd also shown people something dangerous: that they didn't have to accept grinding poverty as inevitable.

"What do you need?" Chen Wei asked finally.

"Either increase wages to make work attractive again, or enforce participation through compliance mechanisms."

"Compliance mechanisms?"

"Cut benefits for anyone who refuses work. Restrict housing access. Make unemployment painful enough that they take the jobs."

Chen Wei considered it. "The first option—increasing wages—what's the cost?"

"Approximately 18% increase across lower-tier positions to match competitive rates. Call it 340 million credits annually."

"And enforcement?"

"Cheaper short-term. But if we push too hard, we risk another riot. Or worse—an actual general strike."

"They wouldn't dare."

"Sir, they rioted for six hours against SSS. Forty-seven died and they kept fighting. I'm not sure 'wouldn't dare' applies anymore."

Chen Wei closed the briefing. "I'll take this to Council. In the meantime, keep posting positions. Make it clear that unemployment records affect future housing and benefit access."

"Threaten them into compliance."

"Incentivize better choices," Chen Wei corrected.

But they both knew what it was.

In Level 8, Miguel Torres finished his shift cleaning Level 4 bathrooms and did the math.

Forty hours a week at 8.5 credits per hour: 340 credits weekly.

Rent: 280 credits monthly, split with roommate = 140 credits weekly.

Food: 60 credits weekly if he was careful.

Transport: 25 credits weekly.

Utilities: 30 credits weekly.

Total: 255 credits weekly.

Income: 340 credits weekly.

Margin: 85 credits. For everything else. Medical care. Clothing. Emergencies. Life.

He'd been doing this math for three years. It never got better.

But six months ago, his neighbor had told him about a food cooperative. Twenty families pooling resources. Buying in bulk. Cooking collectively.

Miguel's food costs had dropped to 30 credits weekly.

Then a housing collective formed. Thirty people in shared space, splitting costs.

Miguel's rent dropped to 80 credits weekly.

New math: Essential costs now 165 credits weekly. Margin now 175 credits.

Or—and this was the dangerous thought—he could work twenty hours instead of forty. Make 170 credits weekly. Cover costs. Have time to actually live.

His manager had called him into the office yesterday: "Torres, your performance is slipping. You've called out twice this month."

"I was sick."

"You were absent. This job requires commitment."

Miguel had looked at his manager—a woman who made triple his wage to tell him to clean shit faster—and thought: Why?

Why commit to a job that barely kept him alive? Why give forty hours a week to a corporation that would replace him tomorrow without a thought?

Uncle Nico had shown them something: that survival didn't require complete submission. That they had power, if they chose to use it.

The cooperatives were proof. They worked. Not perfectly. But well enough.

"I'm reducing my hours to part-time," Miguel had said.

"We don't offer part-time in sanitation."

"Then I quit."

He'd walked out. Terrified. Exhilarated.

And he'd survived. The cooperative had absorbed him. Given him work—real work, not degrading shit—that paid enough. Connected him to people who needed his skills.

He wasn't alone. Hundreds were making the same choice.

The system called it laziness.

Miguel called it math.

Director Chen Wei's report reached the Corporate Council three days later.

Labor participation down 18%.

Productivity down 23%.

Informal cooperatives spreading.

People choosing survival over compliance.

The Nico Chen effect.

Chair Volkov read the report twice. Then called for a strategy session.

The war wasn't over.

It was just beginning.
