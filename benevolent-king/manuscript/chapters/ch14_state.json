  "notes": "Bridge chapter showing Nico's transformation from charity to power. Gang confrontation forces him to choose: pay protection or resist with force. He chooses force, hiring security and responding to firebomb with violence. Key moment: bomber's hands broken, Nico pays medical bills—showing complexity. He hurts people but also helps them. The detail about Mara's kids being threatened makes threat personal. Kade's role evolves to enforcer/advisor pushing pragmatic violence. Arc 0.48—past halfway, Nico crossing moral lines he said he wouldn't. The firebomb test shows gangs will challenge any power. Security costs (150k/week) increase burn rate. Temptation to use Veil grows—stress mounting. Title 'Complications' understates the moral weight—he's becoming a gang leader while claiming to run charity. The line 'kings have to do ugly things' captures the corruption of power theme. Nico wanted to just feed people; now he's ordering violence. The system forced this choice—you can't disrupt Level 8 economics peacefully."
