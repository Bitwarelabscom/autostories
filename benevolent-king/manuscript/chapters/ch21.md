# Chapter 21: The Kingdom Flourishes

**Three years later**

The boardroom on Level 2 smelled like imported coffee and expensive cologne. Director Yuki Tanaka adjusted the holoprojection, and twelve faces around the polished synthwood table leaned forward to study the numbers floating in the air.

"Labor participation in Levels 7 through 9 has declined by 18% over the past thirty-six months," Tanaka said, her voice tight with controlled frustration. "We're currently running at 73% of required workforce capacity for sanitation, maintenance, and food service operations."

"Eighteen percent," Corporate Council Chair Marcus Volkov repeated, stroking his silver beard. "That's not a fluctuation. That's a trend."

"It's a goddamn disaster," growled Director Chen Wei from Operations. "Do you know how many uncollected waste bins we have in Level 4? Do you know what happens when waste processing falls behind schedule?"

Tanaka swept her hand through the hologram, pulling up new data. "The correlation is undeniable. The decline began thirty-seven months ago and has accelerated steadily. Cross-referencing with social surveillance data, we've identified the primary cause."

She pulled up a grainy security photo: a thin East Asian man with tired eyes and nervous hands, caught mid-laugh at a street market.

"Nico Chen. Age thirty-five. Former small-time dealer, current—" she paused, clearly uncomfortable with the term, "—benefactor of Level 8's Jade District. Known locally as 'Uncle Nico' or 'The King.'"

"We're aware of Mr. Chen," Volkov said dryly. "Station Security has a thick file."

"Then you're aware he's been running an unlicensed welfare operation for three years," Tanaka continued. "Free meals daily, subsidized housing, medical clinic, job placement services—all funded by approximately 2 million credits annually."

"Where's the money coming from?" asked Director Okoye, Financial Compliance.

"Unknown. His documentation shows inheritance from a deceased aunt's estate, liquidated assets, various investments. SSS has investigated multiple times. Commander Wright believes the paperwork is professionally forged, but it holds up legally."

"So we have a criminal running a shadow government in our lower levels," Chen Wei said, "and we can't touch him?"

"It's worse than that," Tanaka replied. She pulled up more data: labor statistics, economic projections, social metrics. "He's not just giving away food. He's changed the economic calculation for thousands of workers. Why take a shit job in Level 4 sanitation when you can eat free in Level 8? Why work fifty hours a week processing waste when you can work twenty and still survive?"

"They're lazy," Chen Wei spat. "We've coddled them, and now they expect handouts."

"They're making rational choices," Volkov corrected quietly. "That's actually more concerning. If refusing degrading labor becomes viable, the entire tier system destabilizes."

The room fell silent. The hologram rotated slowly, showing heat maps of workforce participation declining like a spreading infection.

"What are our options?" Okoye asked.

"Commander Wright suggests targeted enforcement," Tanaka said. "Charge Chen with tax fraud, seize assets, shut down the operation. But—" she grimaced, "—SSS estimates significant civil unrest. Possibly thousands in the streets."

"Let me get this straight," Director Reeves from Resource Management spoke up. "We can't arrest him because people would riot to protect a drug dealer?"

"Former dealer," Tanaka corrected. "He hasn't been caught selling in three years. And yes. Our surveillance suggests he's beloved. Genuinely beloved."

"Fuck," someone muttered.

Volkov leaned back in his chair. "Continue monitoring. Have Wright increase pressure—inspections, fines, bureaucratic harassment. Make it expensive and difficult. Most importantly, start a PR campaign. We need to shift public perception before we can act."

"What's the narrative?" Tanaka asked.

"That he's a warlord who's made Level 8 dependent on his charity. That he's keeping them trapped instead of helping them rise. That this isn't compassion—it's control." Volkov smiled without warmth. "Find people he's hurt. There's always someone he's hurt."

Three hundred and fifty kilometers spinward, in what used to be Level 8's worst housing block, Nico Chen sat in the back room of Chen's Noodle House and tried not to look at the financial reports spread across his tablet.

"You're doing the thing where you stare without seeing," Kade said from the doorway. "Want to talk about it or want to get high?"

Nico laughed despite himself. "Both? Neither? I don't fucking know, man."

Kade settled into the opposite chair, moving with the careful precision of someone whose body hurt more than he'd admit. Three years of reduced Veil use had bought them both clarity but not comfort. Nico's hands still shook without a morning hit. Kade still woke up screaming twice a week.

But they were alive. Functional. That counted for something.

"How bad?" Kade asked.

"We're spending 165k a week now," Nico said. "Up from 40k when we started. The clinic alone is 60k. Housing subsidies another 45k. Food's actually down because we've got economies of scale, but—" He rubbed his face. "We've burned through 32 million credits in three years."

"How much left?"

"Sixteen million, give or take. Maybe four years at current burn rate. Less if we expand."

"Are we expanding?"

"Maya wants to add a youth center. Lin's pushing for elder care services. There's a woman on sublevel 8-C who asked if we could help with school supplies." Nico's laugh was hollow. "Everyone wants a piece of Uncle Nico's generosity."

"You could say no."

"Could I?" Nico met his friend's eyes. "You've seen what it's like out there now. Kids aren't going hungry. Families have safe housing. Old folks are getting medical care. How the fuck do I look Lin Zhao in the eye and say 'sorry, grandma, we're cutting elder care because I need to make the money last longer'?"

"You could say exactly that," Kade replied. "She'd understand. She knows this can't last forever."

"Yeah? Does she? Because every week someone else comes to me like I'm some kind of fucking miracle worker. 'Uncle Nico, my kid needs medicine.' 'Uncle Nico, our building's heat exchanger broke.' 'Uncle Nico, can you—' Can you—can you—" He stopped, breathing hard.

Kade waited.

"I'm terrified," Nico admitted quietly. "Three years ago, I was nobody. Just another junkie dealer waiting to die in a pod hotel. Now I'm responsible for thousands of people. Thousands, Kade. What happens when the money runs out?"

"Same thing that happened before you found it," Kade said. "People survive. They always do."

"But they'll remember that it was better. That's the fucked up part. Wright was right, back when he warned me. I've shown them what life could be like, and when it ends, they'll know exactly what they've lost."

A knock on the door interrupted them. Maya poked her head in, professional demeanor softening when she saw Nico's expression.

"Bad time?"

"Nah, come in." Nico closed the tablet, hiding the numbers. "What's up?"

Maya settled into the third chair, still wearing her old social services ID badge even though she'd quit that job six months ago. Some habits died hard.

"Lin sent me. There's a family in Block 7, four kids, just got evicted from Level 7. Father lost his job, mother's sick, they're living in the maintenance corridors. She wants to know if we can—"

"House them," Nico finished. "Yeah. Of course. Add them to the list."

"The list is fifty-three families long," Maya said gently. "We're running out of subsidized units."

"Then buy another building."

"Nico—"

"I said buy another building!" He stood abruptly, chair scraping back. "What do you want me to do, Maya? Tell them to go back to the corridors? Let those kids freeze?"

"I want you to think long-term," Maya said, her voice level. "We're treating symptoms, not disease. The system that evicted that family is still intact. All we're doing is building a bubble that's going to pop."

"Then we patch the bubble! We keep it inflated as long as we can!"

"That's not sustainable."

"I don't give a fuck about sustainable!" Nico's hands trembled. "I care about those four kids eating dinner tonight. I care about their mother getting medicine. Everything else is—is philosophy. Academic bullshit while people suffer."

Maya stood, meeting his anger with steady calm. "I love you," she said. "That's not philosophy or academic bullshit. I love you, and I'm watching you destroy yourself trying to be everyone's savior. You can't save the world, Nico. You can barely save yourself."

"Then what am I supposed to do?"

"I don't know," Maya admitted. "But this—" she gestured at the room, the tablet, the weight of it all, "—this isn't working. You're exhausted. Kade's exhausted. The money's running out. And instead of preparing for what comes next, you're buying more buildings."

"Because people need them!"

"People need a lot of things. They need a system that doesn't evict families with sick mothers. They need wages that cover food and rent. They need—"

"They need help NOW!" Nico shouted. "Not after we've dismantled capitalism or petitioned the Council or whatever the fuck long-term solution you're imagining. Now, Maya. Today. Tonight. Every single day."

The silence stretched between them.

"I'm not arguing against helping people," Maya said finally. "I'm arguing for helping them in a way that lasts beyond your bank account. But you're right. Those kids need dinner tonight. So yes, buy the building. House the family. I'll add them to the list."

She left, closing the door with deliberate gentleness.

Kade whistled softly. "Trouble in paradise?"

"Fuck off."

"No, seriously. She's not wrong. You know she's not wrong."

"I know," Nico admitted. He sank back into his chair. "I just don't know what the alternative is. What am I supposed to do—organize a revolution? Overthrow the Corporate Council? I found some money in a dead guy's apartment. I didn't sign up to be Che Guevara."

"Who?"

"Old Earth revolutionary. Never mind." Nico pulled out his vape pen, took a long hit of Veil. The familiar warmth spread through his chest, dulling the sharp edges of panic. "I just want to help people. Why is that so complicated?"

"Because help isn't neutral," Kade said. "Every credit you spend is a choice about who gets it and who doesn't. Every person you house is someone else you turn away. You're playing god, man. That's always complicated."

"I never wanted to play god."

"Yeah, well. Should've thought of that before you became a king."

That night, Nico walked through the Jade District—his district, though he still felt weird claiming it—and tried to see it through fresh eyes.

The transformation was undeniable. Three years ago, these streets had been dark, dangerous, desperate. Now? Street lights worked. Trash got collected. The air recyclers hummed efficiently instead of coughing out stale oxygen.

Chen's Noodle House had a line out the door at dinner time, but everyone got served. The medical clinic's lights were on, Dr. Reyes treating a steady stream of patients. The community center—opened last year—hosted evening classes in basic tech repair, child care, even art.

People recognized him. Called out greetings. "Evening, Uncle Nico!" "Thanks for everything, Mr. Chen!" A woman pressed a container of homemade dumplings into his hands, refusing payment.

Lin Zhao sat on a bench outside the newly renovated senior center, wrapped in a thermal blanket, watching the street like a general surveying her kingdom.

"You look troubled, child," she said when Nico sat beside her.

"Maya thinks we're doing it wrong."

"Maya thinks you should solve systemic oppression instead of just feeding people," Lin corrected. "She's idealistic. It's charming."

"Is she wrong?"

Lin was quiet for a long moment. "When I was young, I believed in revolution. I believed if we just organized, if we stood together, we could change everything. I marched. I protested. I lost friends to SSS batons and corporate retaliation." She shook her head. "The system doesn't change, Nico. It just grinds up anyone who challenges it and keeps spinning."

"So what? We just accept it?"

"We survive it. We take care of each other. We build small good things in the cracks of a broken machine." She patted his hand. "What you've done here—it matters. Don't let perfect be the enemy of good."

"The money's going to run out."

"Yes."

"And then what?"

"Then we'll survive like we did before. But the people you've helped will remember. The kid whose malnutrition you treated will grow up stronger. The family you housed will have stability for a few years. The elder who got medicine will live to see grandchildren." Lin smiled. "Temporary good is still good, child."

"Wright said the opposite. He said temporary help that ends is worse than no help."

"Commander Wright sold his soul to climb two tiers. He wouldn't recognize good if it arrested him." Lin's voice sharpened. "You want to know the difference between you and him? He thinks helping people makes them dependent. You think helping people makes them human. Don't let his cynicism infect you."

Nico sat with that for a while, watching his district live. A couple walked past, hand in hand. A group of kids played some complicated game involving a ball and chalk markings. An old man fed a stray cat outside the noodle house.

Small moments. Small kindnesses. Temporary, maybe. But real.

"I don't know how to do this," he admitted.

"Nobody does," Lin said. "That's the secret they don't tell you. Everyone's just improvising, trying not to fuck up too badly." She stood, joints creaking. "Buy the building for that family. House those kids. Let Maya complain about sustainability. We're all going to die eventually anyway. Might as well do some good while we're here."

She shuffled back toward the senior center, leaving Nico alone with his thoughts.

He pulled out his tablet, pulled up the financial reports again. Sixteen million credits. Four years, give or take. Or three years if they kept expanding. Or two years if something went wrong.

Temporary.

But right now, in this moment, three hundred kids were going to bed with full stomachs in heated rooms. That had to count for something.

He opened his messages, found Maya's contact.

*Buy the building. House the family. You're right about everything else, but those kids need help tonight.*

Her response came quickly: *I know. I already bought it. Unit 7-G is ready for them.*

Despite everything—the money running out, the impossible choices, the future bearing down like a freight train—Nico smiled.

They were in this together. All of them. Building something temporary and beautiful and doomed.

His kingdom. His impossible, precarious kingdom.

For however long it lasted.

In SSS headquarters, Commander Wright reviewed the surveillance footage from Level 8. Three years of watching, waiting, documenting. Three years of this drug dealer playing saint.

The file was thick enough now. Tax irregularities, unlicensed business operations, suspicious financial transactions. Enough to act, if the Corporate Council gave the order.

But they hadn't. Not yet.

"Sir?" Lieutenant Mboto appeared in his doorway. "The Council wants an update on the Chen situation."

"Tell them what they already know," Wright said. "He's spending money, helping people, and creating long-term instability. When he inevitably collapses, thousands of people who've become dependent on his charity will riot. We're sitting on a powder keg, and he's playing with matches."

"Should we intervene?"

Wright thought about the kids eating in that noodle house. The families in subsidized housing. The old woman on the bench, smiling like she'd found hope.

"Not yet," he said. "Let him burn through his money. Let people get comfortable. The higher they rise, the harder they'll fall."

"And if he doesn't run out of money?"

"Everyone runs out eventually," Wright said. "Time, money, luck—it all runs out. We just have to be patient."

He closed the file. Nico Chen's tired face stared up from the cover photo.

*Enjoy it while it lasts*, Wright thought. *Kings don't stay kings for long. Not in Level 8.*

Not anywhere.
