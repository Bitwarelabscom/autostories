  "notes": "Critical chapter—Lin challenges Nico's entire model. Santos story serves as cautionary tale. The 'impossible choice' test shows charity's limitations. Key insight: problem isn't lack of resources, it's systemic design. Nico must evolve from savior to organizer. Arc 0.52—past midpoint, facing hard truths about sustainability. Lin's test: he passed by listening (character growth). But admits he likes being needed (ongoing flaw). 10-month timeline creates urgency. Chapter title 'Lin's Test' has double meaning—test of character and test of model. Sets up Book 3's evolution toward collective organizing. Nico leaves with mission: make himself unnecessary. Doesn't know how—that's the work ahead."
