  "notes": "Bridge chapter showing Nico's desperation and sacrifice to verify the core. He gives up everything - possessions, personal Veil supply, endures severe withdrawal - showing how powerful his hope is. The verification scene reveals staggering amount (30-60 million estimate, exact amount in Ch 5) and establishes danger. Specs's warnings set up the strategy chapters to come. Kade's kindness (free vial) shows their friendship has real care. Arc barely moves (0.03) because Nico is still reacting, not yet acting on the money. The 4 days between chapters creates narrative space and shows passage of time. Ending on 'no idea what to do with it' sets up Ch 4's processing and Ch 5's planning with Kade. This chapter is about paying the cost before getting the prize - thematically important for Book 1's arc."
