# Chapter 27: The Cutoff

The lights went out at 0300 station time.

Nico jerked awake in darkness so complete he couldn't see his own hand. The constant hum of air recyclers—background noise he'd stopped consciously hearing years ago—was gone. In the sudden silence, he heard Kade swearing in the next room.

"Power's out," Kade called through the wall.

"No shit." Nico fumbled for his comm unit. The screen provided a tiny pool of light. 3:14 AM. "Probably just a grid failure. Happens all the time down here."

But even as he said it, something felt wrong.

The emergency lights should have kicked on. They always kicked on.

Nico pulled on pants and shoes, grabbed a hand torch from the emergency kit under his bed. The beam cut through absolute darkness. He opened his door to find Kade already in the hallway, his own torch casting wild shadows.

"This isn't normal," Kade said.

From outside: voices rising. Confusion, then concern, then fear spreading like wildfire through the housing block.

They made their way downstairs, joining a crowd gathering in the street. Without the ubiquitous glow of light strips and advertisement screens, Level 8 looked ancient, primordial. Like a cave.

Lin Zhao stood in the center of the growing crowd, her torch illuminating a portable comm terminal.

"It's not just our block," she called out. "Power's out across the entire Jade District. Water pressure's dropping. Air recyclers down to emergency backup only."

"How long till backup fails?" someone asked.

"Six hours. Maybe eight if we're lucky."

The crowd's fear became palpable. Eight hours without fresh air in a sealed station section meant CO2 buildup. Meant suffocation, slow and inevitable.

"This has to be a malfunction," Nico said, pushing through to Lin. "Even Corporate wouldn't—"

His comm unit pinged. Official message, station-wide broadcast:

*NOTICE: Utility services to Level 8, Sections 8-A through 8-F have been suspended due to outstanding violations of Station Ordinance 4417-B (Unlicensed Commercial Operations), Ordinance 6621-A (Tax Code Violations), and Ordinance 8834-C (Public Health and Safety Violations). Service will resume upon compliance with all outstanding citations and payment of fines totaling 2.4 million credits. Appeals may be filed through Station Administrative Court. Have a safe day.*

The message repeated. Cold. Bureaucratic. Murderous.

"They're killing us," someone whispered.

The whisper became a shout, became a roar. Nico's torch was suddenly insufficient against the press of bodies, the mounting panic.

"Everyone calm down!" Lin's voice cut through. "We have eight hours. That's time enough to fix this."

"Fix it how?" a man shouted. "We can't breathe credits!"

"Uncle Nico will handle it," someone else called. "He always handles it."

A hundred faces turned to Nico. Torches and comm screens illuminated desperate hope.

*Fuck.*

---

By 0600, Nico had assembled his crisis team in Chen's Noodle House, running on generator power that wouldn't last past noon.

Maya hunched over her comm, trying to reach anyone in Station Administration. Kade was on the line with black market contacts, pricing emergency air recyclers. Lin coordinated neighborhood leaders, organizing an orderly response before panic took hold.

And Nico? Nico was trying not to vomit.

"2.4 million in fines," he read off the official notice for the tenth time. "For violations I've never been formally charged with. This is—it's—"

"It's warfare," Maya said flatly. "They don't need to charge you formally. They just create regulations you're violating and enforce selectively."

"Can we fight it?"

"In court? With appeals and lawyers? Sure. In about six months you might get a hearing." Maya's laugh was bitter. "We'll all be dead by then."

"So we pay." Nico pulled up his financial accounts. "2.4 million. That's—fuck, that's a huge chunk of what's left. But we can pay. We transfer the credits, they turn the power back on, everyone breathes."

"You're assuming they'll turn it back on," Kade said.

"What?"

"Read the notice again. 'Service will resume upon compliance with all outstanding citations and payment of fines.' Compliance first, then payment. They're going to demand you shut down the entire operation."

Nico read it again. Kade was right. The language was carefully crafted. Pay the money AND comply with the citations, which meant ceasing all "unlicensed commercial operations."

"They want me to dismantle everything," Nico said slowly. "Pay them for the privilege of shutting down the restaurants, the clinic, the housing program. Everything."

"And if you refuse," Lin said, "eight thousand people suffocate."

The generator hummed in the silence. Outside, Level 8 waited in darkness.

"We have other options," Kade said carefully. "Black market air recyclers. I can get maybe thirty units, enough for the community centers. Pack people in tight, rotate shifts. Won't be comfortable, but we can keep folks alive for a few days while we—"

"While we what?" Maya interrupted. "This isn't a temporary problem. Even if we survive the immediate crisis, they've shown they're willing to use utilities as a weapon. They'll do it again."

"Then we need to make them afraid to do it again," Lin said quietly.

Everyone looked at her.

"I've seen this before," the old woman continued. "Thirty years ago, Corporate cut power to Level 9 over labor disputes. You know what ended it? A hundred workers walked into Level 5 and started shutting down *their* air recyclers. Fight fire with fire."

"That's terrorism," Maya said.

"That's negotiation," Lin corrected. "You want to know why it worked? Because suddenly the people with power were breathing the same air as the people without it. Amazing how fast utilities got restored."

"People died," Maya said. "That protest turned into a massacre. SSS killed forty-seven people."

"And Corporate restored power." Lin's face was stone. "I'm not saying it's a good option. I'm saying it's the only option that's ever worked."

Nico's hands were shaking. He needed a hit. Needed Veil to smooth out the jagged edges of panic. But there wasn't time. There was never time.

"We're not killing people," he said firmly. "We're not hurting civilians to make a point. That's—no. Absolutely not."

"Then what?" Kade asked. "Because doing nothing means we're the ones killing people. Eight thousand people counting on you, boss. What's the call?"

---

At 0800, Nico transferred 2.4 million credits to Station Administration. The transaction went through instantly. His remaining balance: 11.2 million credits.

At 0815, he filed digital compliance forms agreeing to cease all unlicensed commercial operations within thirty days.

At 0820, he received automated confirmation that his case was under review.

At 0900, the lights were still out.

Maya found him in the back room, head in his hands.

"I paid them," Nico said. "I gave them everything they asked for. Why aren't the lights back on?"

"Because they're under no legal obligation to restore service immediately. The notice said 'upon compliance,' not 'upon payment.' Compliance takes thirty days."

"Thirty days?"

"We have six hours of air left, Nico."

He looked up at her. "I don't know what to do."

"I know."

"I'm supposed to be The King. I'm supposed to protect these people. And I can't—I can't even keep the fucking lights on."

Maya knelt beside him, taking his shaking hands in hers. "Listen to me. This isn't your failure. This is Corporate's choice. They're the ones weaponizing utilities. They're the ones—"

"I'm the one who made them a target!" Nico pulled away. "If I'd never started this, if I'd just kept my head down and sold Veil like a normal fucking dealer, none of this would be happening. Those eight thousand people would be miserable, but at least they'd be breathing!"

"You don't believe that."

"Don't I?" He laughed, wild and ragged. "Wright was right. I gave them hope, and now hope is going to suffocate them. Temporary help that ends badly is worse than no help at all."

"Stop it." Maya's voice was sharp. "You don't get to play martyr while people need you. Yes, this is bad. Yes, you're scared. But you're still The King, which means you need to act like it. Stand up. Figure it out. Or get out of the way and let someone else lead."

The slap of her words straightened his spine.

"Kade said he could get thirty air recyclers," Nico said slowly.

"That's not enough for eight thousand people."

"No. But it's enough for the kids. The elderly. The sick." His mind started working again, moving past panic into cold calculation. "We pack the community centers. Anyone under twelve, anyone over sixty, anyone with respiratory issues—they get recycled air. Everyone else bunks together, conserves movement, breathes shallow."

"For how long?"

"As long as it takes." He stood. "And while they're conserving air, we make noise. Loud noise. We contact every media outlet. Every sympathetic council member. Every corporate exec whose kid we've fed or whose parent we've treated. We make this a scandal they can't ignore."

"That could take days."

"Then we survive for days." Nico grabbed his comm. "Get me a list of everyone under twelve and over sixty. I want them moved to community centers within the hour. Kade—where the fuck is Kade?"

"On the line with his black market contact."

"Tell him I want forty recyclers, not thirty. I don't care what it costs."

"Nico—"

"Forty. And get me Lin. I need her to organize the move. We're going to need calm, orderly evacuation, no panic. If people start stampeding for fresh air—"

"I'll get her."

Maya left at a run. Nico stood alone in the dark, feeling the weight of eight thousand lives pressing down.

*This is what being King means*, he thought. *Impossible choices and people dying if you choose wrong.*

His comm buzzed. Kade: *Can get 35 recyclers. 400k credits. Best I can do.*

Nico typed back: *Buy them. Now.*

Another 400k gone. Down to 10.8 million. The money bleeding out like air from a punctured hull.

But the alternative was letting children suffocate.

Not a choice at all, really.

---

By noon, the youngest children and oldest residents were packed into five community centers, breathing recycled air that tasted like metal and burned their throats but kept them alive. Everyone else was distributed through housing blocks, two families per unit, conserving movement and oxygen.

The word had gone out across station networks. Media requests poured in—some legitimate, some looking for scandal, all getting the same message: *Corporate is killing eight thousand people over paperwork.*

Lin organized watch rotations to prevent panic and monitor air quality. Kade's medical training proved invaluable, treating early CO2 poisoning cases before they became critical.

And Nico? Nico made calls.

Every favor he'd ever earned, every person who'd ever said "if you need anything," every sympathetic ear—he leveraged them all.

By 1400, three council members had issued public statements condemning the utility cutoff.

By 1600, Level 6 workers were organizing a sympathy strike.

By 1800, upper-tier media couldn't ignore the story: children breathing on rationed air while Corporate demanded compliance.

At 1900, Nico's comm rang. Unknown number.

"Chen."

"Mr. Chen, this is Director Yuki Tanaka from the Corporate Council. We'd like to offer a temporary solution to the current situation."

Nico put her on speaker. Maya and Kade crowded close.

"I'm listening."

"We're prepared to restore partial power and water for humanitarian reasons. Twenty percent capacity, enough for basic life support. In exchange, we need good faith compliance with the citations. Close the unlicensed medical clinic within seven days. Cease free meal service within fourteen days. Terminate housing assistance within thirty days."

"Or?"

"Or the partial restoration ends, and we proceed with full enforcement." Tanaka's voice was professionally neutral. "This is a one-time offer, Mr. Chen. I suggest you take it."

Nico looked at Maya. At Kade. At Lin, who'd appeared in the doorway.

"If I close the clinic," he said carefully, "where do the sick go?"

"Station medical services—"

"Are overwhelmed and turn away anyone without credits or insurance."

"That's not my department."

"If I stop free meals, where do families eat?"

"There are numerous affordable—"

"There's nothing affordable in Level 8. That's why people were starving before I started feeding them."

"Again, Mr. Chen, not my department. I'm offering a temporary solution to an immediate crisis. What you do after compliance is your concern."

The line went quiet except for Tanaka's breathing.

"I need to consult with my people," Nico said finally.

"You have one hour. After that, the offer expires."

The call ended.

---

"Take the deal," Maya said immediately.

"What?"

"Take it. Partial power keeps people alive. That's what matters."

"They're forcing me to dismantle everything," Nico said. "The clinic, the food, the housing—everything we've built over three years, gone."

"Three years of help is better than dying today," Maya said. "Take the deal. We'll figure out the rest later."

"There won't be a rest! Once I comply, they've won. They've proven they can break us anytime they want."

"They've already proven that," Kade said quietly. "The lights are out, boss. They've already won this round."

Nico turned to Lin. "What do you think?"

The old woman was quiet for a long moment. "I think," she said finally, "that kings who let their people suffocate for pride aren't remembered kindly. Take the deal. Live to fight another day."

"And when they do this again? Because they will. Once they know we'll fold—"

"Then we fold again," Lin said. "And we get smarter. And we find ways to help that they can't cut off with a power switch. But right now, children are breathing stale air. Make the call, child."

Nico's hands shook so badly he almost dropped the comm.

He thought about Wright's warning: *Temporary help that ends is worse than no help at all.*

He thought about the children in the community centers, breathing metal-tasting air.

He thought about what being King actually meant: making impossible choices where everyone loses.

"Connect me to Director Tanaka," he said to his comm.

The line picked up instantly. She'd been waiting.

"I accept your terms," Nico said. "Partial power for compliance. You have my word."

"Excellent. Power will be restored within thirty minutes. Pleasure doing business, Mr. Chen."

The line went dead.

At 1927 station time, the lights came back on. Twenty percent capacity—enough to see by, enough to run essential air recyclers, enough to survive.

And Nico Chen, The King of Level 8, stood in the half-lit noodle house and felt his kingdom crumbling around him.

"Get me the financial reports," he said quietly. "And a list of everyone employed by our programs. We have seven days to figure out how to close a clinic without killing anyone. Fourteen days to stop feeding families without starving them. Thirty days to end housing assistance without making people homeless."

"Nico—" Maya started.

"Just get me the reports."

He walked out into the dim street. Twenty percent power made everything look sickly, washed out. People were emerging from buildings, cautiously celebrating restored utilities. They saw him and cheered.

Uncle Nico. The King. The man who'd saved them again.

If only they knew how hollow the victory was.

Kade joined him, offering a vape pen. Nico took it, inhaled deeply. Veil hit his bloodstream, smoothing the sharp edges of failure.

"We'll figure it out," Kade said.

"Yeah?"

"No." Kade's laugh was dark. "We're fucked. But we'll figure out how to be fucked with dignity."

"That's the spirit."

They stood together in the half-light, watching Nico's kingdom breathe on borrowed air and borrowed time.

Somewhere in Level 2, Director Tanaka was probably filing a report: *Chen complied. Weakness confirmed. Proceed to next phase.*

And somewhere in SSS headquarters, Commander Wright was probably smiling.

The King was broken.

The fall had begun.
