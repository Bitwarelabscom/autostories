  "notes": "Third tentpole chapter (MIDPOINT REVERSAL). This is THE turning point - Nico's goal inverts from personal escape to community support. Made drunk and high, the decision is both reckless and authentic. His frustration with systemic rejection boils over into defiant generosity. Key line: 'Because fuck them.' The alcohol and Veil lower his inhibitions enough to do what maybe he wanted to do anyway. Mrs. Chen's blessing gives it legitimacy. Public announcement means no taking it back. Arc position jumps to 0.25 - he's committed to a new path even if he doesn't fully understand it yet. This single decision sets up the entire rest of the trilogy."
