  "notes": "Bridge chapter showing Nico's elevation to folk hero/king status. Title shift from dealer to Uncle to King. Lin Zhao introduced as radical elder voice challenging charity model. Key theme: charity vs revolution, survival vs system change. Nico uncomfortable with power but can't refuse it. Using less Veil (progress?) because too busy. Arc 0.42—past midpoint, fully committed but struggling with sustainability and strategy. The gathering crowds show his visibility—can't hide anymore. Lin's challenge plants seed for Book 3's evolution. The 'Uncle' title shows cultural respect and family language—he's become part of community identity. His daily request load (7+) shows impossibility of individual charity at scale. Burn rate down to one year maximum creates urgency. Chapter ends with acceptance: he's the King whether he wants it or not, must figure out what that means."
