# Chapter 15: Authorities Notice

The Station Security Services liaison arrived at Chen's Noodle House during the breakfast rush.

Nico was in the kitchen, arguing with the cook about portion sizes—they'd been running out of noodles by mid-morning lately, which meant either ordering more supplies or turning people away, and he'd rather eat glass than turn people away—when Kade appeared in the doorway with his danger face on.

"We have a problem," Kade said quietly.

"What kind of problem?"

"The kind with badges and legal authority to make our lives hell." Kade jerked his head toward the dining room. "SSS. Asking questions."

Shit.

Nico wiped his hands on his apron—he wore an apron now, like he was actually a restaurant owner instead of a junkie playing pretend—and followed Kade out to the front. The morning crowd was thick today, maybe fifty people packed into a space meant for thirty, all eating their free breakfast noodles and drinking their tea. Some he recognized: Mrs. Huang, the Patel brothers, Jess who'd found a new job thanks to connections Nico had bought her. Others were strangers, people who'd heard about the free food and come from other sectors of Level 8.

Word spread fast in hell.

The SSS liaison stood near the door, a woman in the gray-and-black uniform that marked her as institutional power. Not a grunt-level guard—those were the ones who beat people during raids—but someone higher up. Someone who asked questions instead of swinging batons.

She was scanning the crowd with the professional assessment of someone who saw people as data points. When her eyes landed on Nico, she smiled. It didn't reach her eyes.

"Nico Chen?" she asked, though she clearly already knew.

"That's me, yeah?" He kept his voice casual, like station security showing up was no big deal. "Something I can help you with, Officer...?"

"Specialist Yuki Tanaka, SSS Financial Crimes Unit." She pulled a tablet from her belt. "I'd like to ask you a few questions about your recent business activities."

Financial Crimes Unit. Shit, shit, shit.

"Sure," Nico said, keeping the smile plastered on. "Happy to help. Want to talk here or somewhere private?"

"Private would be better."

He led her to the back office—Mrs. Chen's old office, now his, still smelling faintly of the jasmine tea she'd favored. It was a cramped space, just big enough for a desk and two chairs, with walls thin enough that you could hear the kitchen noise. Kade followed them in and leaned against the wall, arms crossed. His presence screamed bodyguard.

Specialist Tanaka didn't seem bothered. She sat, placed her tablet on the desk, and pulled up a file. Nico's file, probably. His arrest record, his dealing charges, every official documentation of his fuck-ups.

"Mr. Chen," she began, "you've recently acquired several businesses on Level 8. Chen's Noodle House, Lee's Dumplings, the Brass Bowl, and Papa Ko's Kitchen. Total purchase price approximately four hundred thousand credits."

"Is that a question?"

"You've also begun providing free meals at all four establishments. Breakfast, lunch, and dinner. We estimate you're serving between five and eight hundred meals per day, depending on the day of the week."

"Sounds about right."

"You've also made significant donations to the Level 8 Community Health Clinic—enough to keep it running for the next six months when it was scheduled to close. Another hundred and fifty thousand credits."

"Guilty." Nico leaned back in his chair, trying to project confidence he didn't feel. "Is charity illegal now?"

"Charity isn't illegal, Mr. Chen. But we have questions about the source of your funds." Tanaka's expression remained neutral, professional. "Three months ago, you were a small-time Veil dealer with multiple arrests and negative net worth. Now you're spending hundreds of thousands of credits on community services. That's a dramatic change."

"I inherited money from a relative."

"Which relative?"

"An uncle. Died off-station, left me his savings."

"Name of this uncle?"

Nico had prepared for this, worked out the story with Kade weeks ago. "Chen Wei-long. Lived on Europa Station, worked in mining logistics. Died of lung disease two months back. Left everything to me."

"And you can provide documentation of this inheritance?"

"Sure. Death certificate, will, transfer records." All forged, all purchased from Specs for a not-insignificant fee, but they'd pass casual inspection. "I can have my lawyer send them over."

"Your lawyer." Tanaka's eyebrow rose. "You have a lawyer now."

"Man spends half a million credits, he gets a lawyer, yeah?"

"Mm." She made a note on her tablet. "Mr. Chen, I'm going to be frank with you. Your story is plausible. The documentation you'll provide will likely check out. But something about this situation doesn't sit right with me."

"That sounds like a you problem, Specialist."

Kade made a warning sound, but Tanaka just smiled slightly. "Perhaps. But here's what I see: a Level 8 dealer suddenly flush with cash, spending it conspicuously on very public charity that's making him quite beloved in this community. Some might call that buying loyalty. Building a power base."

"Some might call it helping people."

"Those things aren't mutually exclusive." She leaned forward. "Let me tell you what concerns us, Mr. Chen. We have gangs on Level 8. We have drug operations. We have people who'd like to expand their influence beyond street corners. When someone starts amassing community loyalty this quickly, especially someone with your background, we pay attention."

"I'm feeding people. That's it."

"Are you using your restaurants to distribute drugs?"

"No."

"Are you laundering money through these establishments?"

"No."

"Are you building a criminal organization under the guise of charity?"

"Jesus Christ." Nico ran his hand through his hair. "No. I found out I had money, I decided to do something decent with it. That's the whole story. Is it so fucking hard to believe that someone on Level 8 might actually want to help instead of hurt?"

Tanaka studied him for a long moment. "In my experience, Mr. Chen, people don't suddenly become altruistic. They become altruistic for reasons. You're twenty-eight years old, a Veil addict, and until three months ago you were living in a sleeping pod. What's your reason?"

The question hung in the air. What was his reason? Because he'd tried to escape and failed? Because the system had proven it would never let him rise? Because drunk and high and angry, he'd decided to burn his escape money on Level 8 out of spite and maybe something better?

"Because I'm tired," Nico said finally. "Tired of watching people starve while the upper tiers throw away enough food to feed this whole level. Tired of seeing kids grow up thinking this is all there is. Tired of the math not mathing, you know? We work the shittiest jobs maintaining this station, and we can't even afford to eat. That's obscene. So yeah, I'm spending money to fix a tiny piece of that obscenity. Sue me."

"I'm not going to sue you, Mr. Chen." Tanaka stood, collecting her tablet. "But I am going to be watching. If your story checks out, if your paperwork is clean, then congratulations on your inheritance and your charity work. But if I find any connection to criminal activity—drug distribution, money laundering, racketeering—I will shut this operation down and arrest everyone involved. Are we clear?"

"Crystal."

"Good." She moved toward the door, then paused. "For what it's worth, what you're doing here is making a difference. I've seen the meal lines. I've read the reports on reduced petty crime in this sector since you started. That counts for something."

"Just not enough to stop investigating me."

"Just not enough to stop investigating you," she agreed. "We'll be in touch, Mr. Chen."

After she left, Nico sat in the sudden silence, his heart hammering. Kade remained against the wall, his expression unreadable.

"Well," Kade finally said. "That was a fucking disaster waiting to happen."

"She doesn't have anything on us."

"She doesn't have anything yet. But she's looking, which means others are looking, which means we're on someone's radar." Kade pushed off the wall, pacing the tiny office. "I told you this would happen. Told you that going public, making noise, would draw attention."

"Yeah, and I told you I don't care."

"Well, you should care. Because attention means investigation, and investigation means they'll eventually find something. Maybe not the data core—Specs covered those tracks well—but something. Your drug dealing, your associates, hell, even your medical records showing you're actively using. They'll find a lever, Nico, and they'll use it to shut you down."

"So what do you want me to do? Stop feeding people?"

"I want you to be smart about this!"

"I am being smart! I've got clean documentation, I'm paying taxes on all the restaurants, I'm following every fucking regulation—"

"You're a junkie playing Robin Hood with stolen money!" Kade's voice rose, then dropped. "Kid, listen to me. I'm on your side. I've been on your side since day one. But this operation's getting bigger than we can manage. Four restaurants, the clinic, and I know you've been looking at housing projects next—"

"People need housing."

"People need a lot of things, and you're trying to provide all of it, and sooner or later you're going to hit something you can't buy your way out of." Kade's expression softened. "I'm not saying stop. I'm saying slow down. Be careful. Don't give them ammunition."

Nico wanted to argue, but he couldn't. Because Kade was right. Every expansion, every public act of charity, painted the target on his back a little brighter. But what was the alternative? Go back to dealing? Back to his pod? Back to pretending the money didn't exist?

"I can't stop," Nico said quietly. "Not now. People are counting on me."

"Then you better hope your documentation holds up, because Specialist Tanaka isn't the end of this. She's the warning shot."

---

That evening, after the dinner service, Nico stood outside Chen's Noodle House and watched the street. Level 8 looked different now. Still grimy, still crowded, still smelling of industrial processes and too many people. But there were fewer fights in this sector. Fewer desperate people pawning their possessions. Fewer children with that hollow-eyed look of chronic hunger.

Small changes. Tiny victories in the face of systemic neglect.

But victories nonetheless.

Maya found him there, appearing out of the crowd like she always seemed to when he was thinking too hard.

"Nico."

"Maya." He didn't turn to look at her. "Let me guess. SSS sent you to follow up on their investigation."

"I don't work for SSS. I'm a social worker, not a cop." She came to stand beside him, following his gaze. "But yes, I heard they came by."

"And?"

"And I think you're doing something remarkable and incredibly stupid."

"That's my brand, yeah?"

"Nico, I'm serious. They're going to keep digging. If there's anything in your past they can use—"

"There's plenty in my past they can use. I'm a dealer, Maya. I've been one for years. They could bust me tomorrow if they wanted." He finally looked at her. "But they won't, because I'm more useful to them this way. A dealer who's feeding hundreds of people and keeping a whole sector peaceful? That's better than just another arrest. They'll watch me, but they won't move unless I fuck up big."

"And if you do fuck up?"

"Then I guess I find out what SSS detention cells look like from the inside."

Maya was quiet for a moment. When she spoke again, her voice was softer. "Why are you doing this?"

"You're the second person to ask me that today."

"Because nobody understands why Nico Chen, professional survivor, is suddenly playing savior."

He considered the question. Really considered it. "Because someone has to. Because I can. Because..." He trailed off, trying to find words for something he barely understood himself. "Because for once in my miserable life, I have the chance to matter. Not just survive, but actually matter. And yeah, maybe it's stupid. Maybe I'll regret it. But I can't not do it, Maya. I've tried."

She reached out, hesitant, and took his hand. Her fingers were warm. "Then don't do it alone. Let me help."

"You'd be risking your job."

"I know."

"Your reputation. Your clean record. Everything you worked for."

"I know," she said again. "But you're not wrong about the system, Nico. I've seen it from the inside. It's broken, and it's designed to stay broken. If you're actually trying to fix a piece of it, even one tiny piece..." She squeezed his hand. "Then I want to help."

Something loosened in Nico's chest. For the first time since Specialist Tanaka had shown up, he felt like he could breathe properly.

"Okay," he said. "Okay, yeah. I could use the help."

They stood there together, watching Level 8, and Nico wondered what they looked like to the people passing by. Two people who'd escaped the bottom, maybe, or two people foolish enough to think they could change it.

Either way, he was committed now.

The authorities were watching. The gangs were circling. His resources, vast as they were, wouldn't last forever.

But standing here with Maya's hand in his, watching the people of Level 8 go about their evening a little less hungry than before, Nico Chen felt something he'd never expected to feel.

Pride.

Dangerous, fragile, probably foolish pride.

But pride nonetheless.

And if that's what got him arrested or killed, well. At least it would be for something that mattered.

At least he'd have tried.
