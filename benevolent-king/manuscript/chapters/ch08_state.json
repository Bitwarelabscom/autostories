  "notes": "Third bridge chapter in 'failed escape' arc. This is the ideological center of Book 1—Maya explicitly explains how the system works and why it's designed to trap Nico. The conversation is heavy with exposition but grounded in emotional stakes: Nico is grieving the loss of hope. The apartment setting is crucial—shows him exactly what he's locked out of, makes it visceral. Maya's journey (15 years, still in debt) establishes that even 'success stories' are barely success. Her distinction between charity and solidarity sets up theoretical framework for Nico's later choices. The revelation that his trapping is BY DESIGN, not accident, shifts his understanding from 'the system is broken' to 'the system is working as intended.' This is radicalizing knowledge. Arc position moves to 0.18—Nico is gaining class consciousness, understanding his position in larger structures. Maya's role evolves from would-be savior to educator to potential ally. The chapter ends quietly with Nico returning to Level 8, but carrying seeds of a new idea: if you can't escape the cage, maybe you can make it more livable. The title 'Maya's World' is both literal (her apartment) and ideological (her understanding of systemic oppression). This chapter is critical setup for Ch 10's decision."
