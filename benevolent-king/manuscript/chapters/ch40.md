# Chapter 40: Forty-Eight Hours

The message came through on an encrypted channel Nico didn't know he had.

*Mr. Chen. The Corporate Council requests a private meeting to discuss resolution of your current legal situation. Come alone to Level 5, Sector 12-B, sublevel maintenance access at 2200 hours tonight. You have my word as Council Chair that you will not be arrested or detained. We wish only to talk.*

It was signed: Marcus Volkov.

"It's a trap," Kade said immediately.

"Obviously," Nico replied. They were in their current safe house—the fourth in two months—reviewing financial reports that made his stomach hurt.

Three hundred thousand credits left. Maybe.

Twelve years of explosive growth and seven years of war with Corporate had burned through nearly fifty million credits. The noodle houses were closed. The clinic was under SSS occupation. The housing program had been dismantled. Everything Nico had built was ash.

But the people remained. Thousands of them, still looking to him for leadership, still believing The King would somehow save them.

He was forty years old, wanted by station security, addicted to Veil, down to his last few hundred thousand credits, and receiving mysterious meeting requests from the Chair of the Corporate Council.

"You can't go," Maya said. She'd arrived ten minutes ago with medical supplies and dark circles under her eyes. "Even if it's not a trap, what could they possibly offer you?"

"I don't know. That's why I'm considering going."

"Nico—"

"We're broke, Maya. Three hundred K left. We can't fund resistance. We can't fund basic survival programs. In a month, maybe two, I'll be completely tapped out." He gestured at the tablet. "What's the plan then?"

"We've been building something bigger than your bank account," Maya said. "The mutual aid networks, the organizing committees, the—"

"All of which need resources. Money. Resources I don't have anymore."

"So you're going to walk into a meeting with Corporate and hope they what, give you more money?"

"I'm going to find out what they want badly enough to promise safe passage." Nico stood. "Maybe they're offering amnesty. Maybe they're offering a way out that doesn't end with me dying in a cell. I won't know unless I go."

"Or you'll walk in there and never walk out." Kade's voice was flat. "You really trust Volkov's word?"

"No. But I don't have many options left."

Lin Zhao appeared in the doorway. She'd been listening, of course. She always listened.

"If you go," she said, "you go wired. Audio and video. Someone monitoring in real-time. First sign of trouble, we leak everything to every media outlet we still have access to."

"They'll scan for wires."

"Then we use a bio-implant transmitter. One-way broadcast. Expensive, but we've got three hundred K burning a hole in your account. Might as well spend it on not dying."

Despite everything, Nico smiled. "When did you become a spy, Lin?"

"I've been poor for sixty years, child. You think I don't know how to survive dangerous people?" She pulled out her comm. "I know someone who can get the implant. Two hours, you'll be ready."

"This is insane," Maya said.

"Agreed," Kade added.

"Probably," Lin said. "But it's also the only move that might change the board. Nico?"

He thought about the three hundred thousand credits. About the thousands of people depending on a king with an empty treasury. About forty-seven dead and counting.

"Make the call," he said. "I'm going."

---

The bio-implant was a rice-grain-sized transmitter lodged in his sinus cavity. Installation hurt like hell. But according to Lin's contact—a former SSS tech named Hassan—it was undetectable unless they did a full medical scan.

"Don't let them scan you," Hassan advised. "If they find this, I don't know you and you didn't get it from me."

"Comforting."

At 2145, Nico left the safe house alone. Kade and Maya were monitoring the broadcast. Lin was coordinating with their remaining media contacts, ready to release everything if Nico didn't check in by midnight.

Level 5 was alien territory. Mid-tier professional housing, clean and sterile and nothing like the Level 8 he'd called home for forty years. The maintenance access was empty, as promised.

At 2202, a door opened. A woman in expensive business wear gestured him inside.

"Mr. Chen. Thank you for coming. Please follow me."

She led him through corridors that got progressively nicer, past security checkpoints that waved them through, into an elevator that climbed.

Up.

Always up.

They emerged in Level 3. Corporate housing. Nico had never been this high in the station.

The woman stopped at a door marked only with a number: 3-4417. She palm-printed the lock. "Chair Volkov is inside. Please, enter."

The door opened to a apartment that cost more than Nico's entire operation.

Floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the station's central axis. Real wood furniture. Art on the walls. The air smelled clean. Not recycled-clean. Actually clean.

Marcus Volkov stood by the window, glass of amber liquid in hand. He was smaller than Nico expected. Mid-sixties, silver beard, eyes that calculated constantly.

"Mr. Chen. Can I offer you a drink?"

"I'm fine."

"Suit yourself. Please, sit." Volkov settled into a chair that probably cost more than Nico's last safe house. "I imagine you're wondering why I asked you here."

"The thought crossed my mind."

"Straight to business, then. Good. I respect efficiency." Volkov took a sip. "We want to offer you a deal."

"I'm listening."

"Complete amnesty for all charges. Financial restitution for assets seized during enforcement actions—let's call it five million credits as a starting point. Citizenship upgrade to Level 3, including housing, medical benefits, guaranteed income. And a formal apology from the Council for the... unfortunate loss of life during the recent unrest."

Nico stared. "You're joking."

"I assure you, I'm not."

"In exchange for what?"

"Your public denunciation of the violence and disorder of the past year. A formal statement that you were misled by radical elements, that you regret the deaths your actions caused, and that you urge all remaining resistors to stand down." Volkov set down his glass. "In short, Mr. Chen: We want you to walk away. Publicly. Definitively. And in exchange, we give you the life you originally wanted when you found that money."

The words hit like a physical blow.

"You knew," Nico said slowly. "About the money. Where it came from."

"We've always known. Fifty million credits doesn't appear in the system without flags. We've known since week one that you were operating on stolen funds." Volkov smiled. "But you were also solving a problem. Labor unrest was building before you started your operation. By giving Level 8's most desperate something to lose, you actually stabilized things. For a while."

"Then why shut me down?"

"Because you got greedy. You didn't just pacify them—you organized them. Gave them hope. Made them believe change was possible." Volkov leaned forward. "Hope is dangerous, Mr. Chen. Far more dangerous than despair. Desperate people are predictable. Hopeful people start revolutions."

"Is that what you think this is? A revolution?"

"It's what it could become. If you keep leading it." Volkov pulled up a holographic display. "Look at labor participation rates across lower tiers. They've been dropping steadily for three years. Productivity is down. Compliance with directives is at all-time lows. Workers are organizing. Agitating. Using your name like a rallying cry."

"I never asked them to."

"Irrelevant. You sparked it. You showed them alternatives. And now they won't go back to the way things were." Volkov gestured at the display. "We can crush this. Full military enforcement, mass arrests, collective punishment until they break. But that's expensive, inefficient, and creates martyrs. Far better to defuse the bomb before it explodes."

"By making me denounce everything I've built."

"By giving you what you actually wanted: wealth, security, citizenship. You didn't start this to be a revolutionary, Mr. Chen. You started it because you wanted to escape Level 8. Well—" he gestured at the window, the apartment, the life of luxury surrounding them, "—here's your escape. All you have to do is take it."

The temptation was a physical ache.

Nico imagined waking up in this apartment. Clean air. No fear. No responsibility for thousands of desperate people. No more hiding in tunnels. No more watching people die for a cause he'd stumbled into accidentally.

Just... peace.

"And if I refuse?" he asked.

"Then we proceed with full enforcement. Your remaining assets are seized. Anyone caught aiding you faces twenty years mandatory. And you—personally—will be hunted until you're caught or killed." Volkov's tone didn't change. "We're offering mercy, Mr. Chen. One chance. After this, there's only war."

"You're already at war with Level 8."

"No. We're at war with you. Remove yourself from the equation, and everything de-escalates." Volkov stood, refilled his drink. "Let me show you something."

He activated another holographic display. Images appeared: A bright apartment with a real window. Medical records showing clean bloodwork, no Veil in the system. Financial accounts with steady income. A life.

"This is you," Volkov said. "Two years from now, if you take the deal. Sober. Healthy. Stable. Contributing to society through legitimate work. Isn't this what you wanted when you first found that money? To not be a junkie dealer dying in Level 8?"

Yes. God yes, that's exactly what he'd wanted.

But two years ago, he'd also wanted to feed hungry kids. And house families. And prove he mattered.

"What about the people I've helped?" Nico asked. "The families in subsidized housing. The kids who were getting fed. The—"

"There are systems in place for social welfare. They can apply through proper channels."

"The channels that rejected them before I started helping?"

"That's not my concern." Volkov's voice hardened. "You have forty-eight hours to decide, Mr. Chen. Accept our offer, and you get everything in this room. Everything you've ever wanted. Refuse, and you get a cell or a grave. Your choice."

He gestured to the door. The meeting was over.

The woman in business wear escorted Nico back down through the levels, past security, back to the maintenance access where this had started.

"Forty-eight hours," she said. "We'll contact you for your answer."

And then Nico was alone, standing in Level 5, mind reeling.

---

Back at the safe house, the team was waiting.

"Did you get all that?" Nico asked.

"Every word," Kade said, pulling up the audio feed. "That was—fuck, Nico. They're offering you everything."

"I know."

"Level 3 citizenship," Maya said. "Medical care that could actually treat your addiction. Financial security. They're offering you a life."

"In exchange for betraying everyone who's followed me."

"In exchange for ending a war you never wanted to fight," Maya corrected. "Nico, think about this. How many more people have to die? How much longer can we sustain this?"

"So I should just give up? Let Corporate win?"

"You should choose life over martyrdom!" Maya's voice cracked. "I've watched you destroy yourself for eight years. Using Veil to function, living in hiding, carrying the weight of thousands of people. You're forty years old and you look sixty. How much longer until you end up like Kade almost did? Or worse?"

"She's right," Kade said quietly. "This—what we're doing—it's killing you. Maybe taking the deal isn't betrayal. Maybe it's survival."

Nico looked at Lin. The old woman had been silent through the whole debrief.

"What do you think?"

Lin was quiet for a long moment. "I think," she said finally, "that Corporate is terrified. They wouldn't offer you Level 3 citizenship if they weren't desperate. Which means what you've built is working. And they need you specifically to tear it down."

"So I should refuse?"

"I think you should ask yourself what you're willing to die for. Because that's what refusing means. They'll kill you, Nico. Maybe not immediately. But eventually. Is what you've started worth your life?"

"I don't know."

"Then you have forty-eight hours to figure it out."

---

Nico spent those hours walking through Level 8. Carefully. Disguised. But walking.

He saw the neighborhoods he'd transformed. Still transformed, even with his operation shut down. The mutual aid networks persisted. Neighbors helping neighbors. Organizing without a benefactor.

He saw the memorial wall for the forty-seven dead. Their names painted in bright colors. Flowers and offerings piled at the base. Terrence Rodriguez. Mrs. Huang. All of them.

He saw families in the housing blocks he'd funded. Still there, still fighting eviction, protected by collective refusal to cooperate with SSS.

And he saw himself reflected in windows: forty years old, exhausted, hunted, addicted, nearly broke.

Was this worth dying for?

Or was Volkov right—that he'd stumbled into something he never intended, and the smart thing was to walk away?

In a quiet corner, Nico pulled out his comm. The deal was still there, glowing on the screen. Level 3 citizenship. Medical care. Peace.

All he had to do was say yes.

Behind him, a child laughed. Nico turned. A kid—maybe six years old—playing in the street with friends. Thin but not starving. Housed but not comfortable.

Surviving.

The kid saw Nico watching and waved. Innocent. Unaware he was waving at The King, at the man who'd fed him when he was younger, at the fugitive whose decision would shape all their futures.

Just a kid waving at a stranger.

Nico waved back.

And in that moment, he knew his answer.

But he had forty-eight hours. So he went back to the safe house, lay down in the dark, and thought about the life he could have had.

The choice he'd have to make.

And what it meant to be a king who'd lost his kingdom but not his people.

Forty-eight hours.

Then everything would change.

Again.
