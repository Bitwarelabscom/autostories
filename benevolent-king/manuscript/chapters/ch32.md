# Chapter 32: The Riot

They came at dawn.

Nico was in the back room of the noodle house, reviewing supply manifests, when the first concussion grenade went off three blocks away. The sound was wrong—too sharp, too loud, too deliberate.

Kade was at the window before the echo faded. "SSS. Full tactical gear. At least four squads."

"Here?" Nico's hands went cold. "They're raiding the district?"

"Not raiding. Invading." Kade pointed at the street below. "Look."

Through the pre-dawn gloom, Nico saw them: armored figures moving in formation, shock batons and riot shields gleaming. At least sixty officers. Maybe more.

Behind them, a prisoner transport vehicle the size of a small shuttle.

They'd come for him.

"Back door," Kade said. "Now."

But before Nico could move, his comm unit exploded with messages. Dozens of them. All saying the same thing:

*They're arresting people. Anyone associated with your operation. Managers, volunteers, kitchen staff—everyone.*

*SSS breaking down doors in the housing blocks.*

*They're asking for you, Uncle Nico. Where are you? What do we do?*

"Fuck." Nico's finger hovered over the back door control. He could run. Should run. Kade was already grabbing their emergency bag.

Another message: *They've got Mrs. Huang from the noodle house. She's seventy years old and they're dragging her into the street.*

Mrs. Huang. Who'd worked the morning shift for two years, serving breakfast to kids who'd never had a hot meal before Nico's operation started.

"We have to go," Kade said. "Right fucking now."

"They're taking everyone," Nico said. "Everyone who's helped us. This isn't a raid—it's a purge."

"Which is why we need to—"

The front door of the noodle house crashed open. Not SSS. Residents. Twenty, thirty, forty people pouring in, faces tight with fear and fury.

"Uncle Nico!" A young man Nico recognized from the community center pushed to the front. "SSS is arresting anyone who works for you. They're saying conspiracy to commit fraud, criminal enterprise, everything. They're talking twenty years mandatory."

"For serving noodles?" someone shouted.

"For helping people," Lin Zhao's voice cut through. She'd appeared in the crowd, wrapped in her thermal blanket. "This is retaliation. Corporate's endgame."

"We need to hide you," the young man said to Nico. "If they can't find you, maybe they'll leave everyone else alone."

"That's not how this works," Kade muttered, but he was drowned out by the growing crowd.

More people flooding in. The street outside filling with bodies. Nico could see it from the window: hundreds of residents emerging from housing blocks, drawn by the sound of concussion grenades and the sight of their neighbors being arrested.

Someone started chanting: "Leave them alone! Leave them alone!"

The chant spread like wildfire. Hundreds of voices, then thousands.

And then it happened.

An SSS officer tried to push through the crowd to reach the noodle house. Someone pushed back. The officer raised his shock baton. A bottle flew from the crowd, shattering against his helmet.

The SSS line charged.

---

Chaos.

That's the only word for it. Nico watched from the window as three years of goodwill and desperation exploded into violence.

Shock batons crackling against makeshift shields. Tear gas canisters arcing through the air. People running, screaming, fighting. The SSS advancing in formation, then breaking as the sheer mass of bodies overwhelmed their line.

"How many people are out there?" Nico whispered.

"Thousands," Lin said flatly. "Everyone you've ever helped. Everyone who's afraid you'll stop helping them. Everyone who's sick of Corporate treating them like disposable labor."

"This is insane. They're going to get killed."

"They're fighting for you," Lin said. "Whether you asked them to or not."

Another concussion grenade. A chunk of the crowd fell back, then surged forward with renewed fury. Someone had found a fire hose and was spraying the SSS line, ruining their footing.

Nico's comm buzzed: Commander Wright.

Against his better judgment, Nico answered.

"Chen. Call them off."

"They're not mine to call off."

"Like hell they're not." Wright's voice was tight. "You're their fucking king. Tell them to stand down before this becomes a massacre."

"You're the ones who started this. Arrest me if you want, but leave everyone else out of it."

"It's not that simple anymore. We have arrest warrants for forty-seven people involved in your operation. Fraud, tax evasion, criminal conspiracy—"

"For feeding people!"

"For running an unlicensed criminal enterprise!" Wright shouted. "You broke the law, Chen. All of you. And now people are going to die because you couldn't just follow the fucking rules."

"Your rules are designed to let people starve."

"And your charity created a dependency that's turning into a riot. Tell me, Chen—how many casualties is a free meal worth?"

Nico didn't have an answer for that.

Outside, the fighting intensified. Someone had set a dumpster on fire. The flames cast wild shadows across the street. Nico could see individual faces in the crowd now: Mothers with makeshift weapons. Old men throwing bottles. Teenagers forming human shields around arrested neighbors.

The community he'd built, tearing itself apart to protect him.

"I can't stop them," Nico admitted.

"Then I'll have to." Wright's tone went cold. "Live rounds authorized. Tell your people to go home, Chen. Or I start stacking bodies."

The line went dead.

"No no no no—" Nico shoved his way through the crowd in the noodle house, heading for the door.

Kade caught his arm. "What are you doing?"

"Wright's authorizing lethal force. I have to—I have to surrender. Stop this before—"

"Before what? You think they'll stop if you surrender? Look out there, man. This stopped being about you ten minutes ago."

Kade was right. The riot had its own momentum now. People weren't fighting for Nico anymore. They were fighting for themselves. For three years of dignity that Corporate was trying to take away.

Maya appeared beside them, face pale. "Casualties coming into the clinic. Mostly shock baton injuries, some broken bones, one—" her voice cracked, "—one gunshot wound. They're already using live rounds."

"Who?"

"Terrence Rodriguez. Nineteen years old. Used to volunteer in the youth center." Her hands were shaking. "He's alive. Barely."

Through the window, Nico saw the SSS line reform. Saw officers raising weapons that weren't shock batons anymore.

Saw the crowd, oblivious, surging forward.

"I have to stop this," Nico said.

"You can't," Lin said. "This is bigger than you now."

"People are dying!"

"People were always dying," Lin said harshly. "Where do you think we are? This is Level 8. People die from malnutrition, from untreated disease, from working conditions that would be illegal if anyone cared. Corporate's been killing us slowly for decades. All that's changed is now they're doing it fast enough for you to notice."

"That's not—"

"Listen to me, child." Lin grabbed his face, forcing him to meet her eyes. "You gave people hope. For three years, you showed them life could be different. And now Corporate's taking that away. You think they'll just accept going back to slow starvation? This riot? This was always coming. You just gave them something worth fighting for."

Another gunshot. Screams.

Nico pulled away from Lin, from Kade, from everyone. He shoved through the crowd, ignoring their shouts, and stepped out into the street.

The noise hit him like a physical force. Thousands of voices. Smoke and tear gas. The crackling of shock batons. And underneath it all, a chant:

"Uncle Nico! Uncle Nico! Uncle Nico!"

People saw him. The chant got louder.

The SSS line saw him too. Wright's voice boomed over loudspeakers: "Nico Chen, you are under arrest. Surrender immediately or—"

The crowd surged forward, putting themselves between Nico and the SSS line. Human shields. Hundreds of them.

"No!" Nico shouted. "Stand down! Let them—"

Nobody listened. Or maybe they couldn't hear him over their own chanting.

The SSS line fired.

Not into the crowd. Above it. Warning shots that ricocheted off the ceiling panels, sending sparks raining down.

But the crowd didn't scatter. They pressed forward.

And then—chaos compounding chaos—someone in the crowd threw something. Not a bottle this time. An improvised explosive. Crude, probably made from cleaning supplies and scavenged electronics, but effective.

The blast took out the front rank of the SSS line. Officers went down screaming.

Wright's voice: "Weapons free! Weapons free!"

The SSS opened fire.

---

Later—hours later, days later, Nico would never be sure—he sat in a hidden maintenance tunnel and tried to understand what he'd just witnessed.

Forty-seven dead. That was the official count. Might have been more.

The riot had burned through the Jade District for six hours before SSS reinforcements from Level 6 finally pushed the crowd back. Six hours of running battles, of makeshift barricades, of people fighting with whatever they could grab.

Kade had pulled Nico off the street minutes after the shooting started, dragging him through back alleys and maintenance corridors while the world tore itself apart.

Maya was somewhere coordinating triage. The clinic had been overwhelmed in the first hour.

And Lin? Lin had been on the front lines, an old woman with a metal pipe, fighting SSS like she was thirty years younger and immortal.

Now Nico sat in darkness, comm unit off, listening to reports filter in from people he'd helped and people he'd doomed:

*Mrs. Huang was trampled in the initial charge. She didn't make it.*

*The Rodriguez kid died in surgery. Gunshot tore through his femoral artery.*

*SSS has the entire district on lockdown. No one in or out.*

*They're still looking for you. Going door to door.*

*The housing blocks you funded? They're arresting everyone who lives there.*

Forty-seven dead.

Because he'd found money in a dead man's apartment. Because he'd wanted to matter. Because he'd thought feeding people was simple.

"You okay?" Kade asked from the darkness.

"No."

"Yeah. Me neither."

They sat in silence. Water dripped somewhere. The air recycler hummed.

"I killed them," Nico said finally.

"Corporate killed them. SSS killed them. The system that makes charity illegal while people starve—that's what killed them."

"I could have run. When the raid started, I could have just run. They'd have arrested the managers, fined the operation, shut us down clean. But I stayed, and people fought for me, and now—"

"Now forty-seven people are dead," Kade finished. "Yeah. That's what happened. But you want to know what else happened? For six hours, Level 8 stood up to Corporate. For six hours, we weren't victims or labor units or disposable poor. We were people fighting for something we believed in."

"They died for free noodles."

"They died for dignity." Kade's voice was fierce in the dark. "Don't you dare cheapen it. Mrs. Huang wasn't stupid. Terrence Rodriguez wasn't stupid. Everyone who fought today knew the risks. They chose to fight anyway."

"I didn't want this."

"Of course you didn't. Kings never want the wars fought in their name. But you don't get to walk away from the crown just because it's getting heavy."

Nico's comm buzzed. He'd turned it off, but the emergency frequency still worked. Maya's voice, barely a whisper:

"Nico, if you're hearing this, stay hidden. They're coming door to door with thermal scanners. They know you're still in the district. And there's—there's talk of collective punishment. Shutting off utilities again until you're handed over. You need to—"

Static. The message cut off.

"Collective punishment," Nico repeated numbly. "They'll starve thousands to find me."

"Then we need to get you out of the district."

"To where? They'll just keep punishing people until someone gives me up."

"So we give you up on our terms." Kade stood, hand extended. "Come on. Time to figure out the next move."

"What next move? It's over. My operation's destroyed, my people are dead, and Corporate won't stop until—"

"Until what? Until they kill you? Break you? Make an example?" Kade hauled Nico to his feet. "Probably. But you don't get to quit. Those forty-seven people died believing you mattered. You going to prove them wrong?"

"I don't know how to do this."

"Nobody does. But you're The King. So act like it."

From somewhere above, Nico heard boots. SSS doing their door-to-door search. Getting closer.

He thought about Mrs. Huang, serving breakfast with a smile even when her arthritis hurt. Thought about Terrence Rodriguez teaching kids how to code in the youth center. Thought about forty-seven people who'd died believing in something he'd built on stolen money and good intentions.

They deserved better than a king who gave up.

"Okay," Nico said. "What's the plan?"

"No idea," Kade admitted. "But Lin's coordinating something. Maya's keeping the clinic running under lockdown. And you're still alive, which means this isn't over."

"Forty-seven people—"

"Will have died for nothing if you give up now," Kade interrupted. "Honor them. Keep fighting. Be the king they needed you to be."

The boots got closer.

"This way," Kade said, leading deeper into the maintenance tunnels. "I know a spot they won't find. Not for a while, anyway."

As they moved through darkness, Nico could hear echoes from above: SSS conducting searches, people being questioned, the heavy machinery of state violence grinding through his district.

His kingdom had become a war zone.

And he was a fugitive king, hiding in tunnels, responsible for forty-seven deaths and thousands of lives still depending on him.

The weight should have crushed him.

Instead, moving through the dark with Kade's sure hand guiding him, Nico felt something unexpected:

Rage.

Cold, clear, focused rage.

Corporate had weaponized utilities. They'd arrested volunteers for feeding people. They'd opened fire on unarmed civilians.

They'd started this war.

And wars didn't end with surrender.

"Kade?"

"Yeah?"

"How many favors do we have left? How many people still owe us?"

"A lot. Why?"

"Because," Nico said, his voice steady for the first time in hours, "we're going to need an army."

From fugitive to rebel.

The King was dead.

Long live the revolution.
