# Chapter 44: Maya's Determination

Maya found Nico in the fourth safe house that week. 'I'm staying,' she said. 'No argument.' 'If you're caught with me—' 'Twenty years. I know. Don't care.' She set down medical supplies. 'Your liver's failing. Kidneys stressed. Years of Veil use catching up. You need treatment.' 'Can't exactly check into a hospital.' 'Then I bring the hospital to you.' For the next week, Maya administered IV fluids, monitored vitals, forced him to rest. 'Why?' Nico asked during one treatment. 'Why risk everything?' 'Because you taught me that some things matter more than safety. Than career. Than following rules that protect oppression.' She adjusted the IV. 'I love you. Not despite your flaws. Including them. You're a disaster. But you're my disaster.' 'I'm dying.' 'We're all dying. Question is what we do with the time we have.' They did what they could. Together. Until the end.
