# Chapter 54: The Betrayal Within

The betrayal came from someone close. A cooperative member who'd been helped early. Needed money. Needed it desperately. Corporate offered 200,000 credits for Nico's location. He took it. Gave them everything. Safe house addresses. Movement patterns. Security protocols. Nico learned about it three hours before the raid. Not enough time to run far. Enough time to prepare. 'Why?' he asked Hassan, who'd brought the intel. 'Why would someone we helped betray us?' 'Because people are desperate. Because 200K is life-changing money. Because Corporate's good at finding the cracks.' Nico understood. Had always understood. Revolution wasn't pure. People weren't perfect. Sometimes desperation won. The question was whether the movement survived individual betrayals. Whether collective power outlasted individual weakness. Time to find out.
