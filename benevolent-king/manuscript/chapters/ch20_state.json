  "notes": "Fifth tentpole chapter (BOOK CLIMAX). This is the culmination of Book 1's arc: Nico has fully transformed from survivor to king, from selfish to community-focused, from isolated to connected. Wright's confrontation establishes the core conflict for Book 2-3: institutional power vs. grassroots change. Key themes resolved: Nico now matters (his core want), but realizes mattering isn't the same as being worthy (his core need, still unmet). Maya's love confession grounds him emotionally. The 'temporary kingdom' metaphor becomes explicit - this can't last forever, but it can last long enough to matter. Arc position 0.65 - major growth but still learning. Book 1 ends with commitment: Nico is The King now, with all the responsibility and danger that entails. Sets up Book 2's escalation: economic war, growing ruthlessness, worsening addiction, money running out. Wright's warning is the thesis for Books 2-3: is temporary help that will collapse better than nothing? Perfect ending that provides closure while opening into larger story."
