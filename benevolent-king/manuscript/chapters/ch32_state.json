  "notes": "Third tentpole of Book 2 (MIDPOINT REVERSAL). Everything changes. SSS raid triggers spontaneous mass resistance, resulting in massacre. Nico transitions from charity provider trying to comply with Corporate to fugitive revolutionary. Key theme: People didn't die for free meals, they died for dignity and the hope Nico showed them. The riot had its own momentum - stopped being about Nico and became about collective assertion of humanity. Character development: Nico's transformation from guilt to cold rage, Kade as fierce defender of the dead's dignity, Lin fighting despite age, Maya under impossible pressure, Wright authorizing violence and blaming Nico. The King becomes the Rebel. Operation destroyed but revolutionary potential born. Sets up second half of Book 2: Nico in hiding, building resistance, planning next moves. Arc position 0.62 - major transformation under extreme trauma."
