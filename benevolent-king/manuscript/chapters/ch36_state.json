  "notes": "Fourth tentpole of Book 2 (DARK NIGHT). Kade's overdose forces Nico to confront his own addiction in immediate, visceral way. Not about recovery or sobriety - about choosing to be present vs choosing to be numb. Key themes: addiction as escape from guilt, harm reduction vs abstinence, being alive as victory. Character development: Nico's first real choice toward sobriety (choosing not to use while monitoring Kade), Kade broken by survivor's guilt, Maya hardened by 47 funerals, Lin as non-judgmental conscience. The weight of the 47 dead permeates everything. Neither character is sober or healed, but both choose to survive. Sets up Book 2 ending: Nico still standing despite everything. Arc position 0.68 - major growth through suffering."
