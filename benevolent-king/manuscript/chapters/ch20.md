# Chapter 20: The Warning

Commander James Wright of Station Security Services didn't announce his arrival. He simply appeared at Chen's Noodle House during the Monday morning rush, six months after Nico had bought his first restaurant, and the crowd parted for him like water around a stone.

Nico saw him through the kitchen window—a tall man in the crisp black uniform of senior SSS command, every line of his posture radiating authority. Not like Specialist Tanaka's methodical investigation. This was different. This was power.

"Kade," Nico said quietly.

Kade looked up from the inventory checklist, saw Wright through the window, and his expression went carefully blank. "You want me to handle this?"

"No. This one's mine."

Nico wiped his hands, pulled off his apron, and walked out to meet the man who could end everything he'd built with a single order.

The restaurant had gone quiet. Three hundred people—the morning crowd had gotten bigger lately—all watching. Watching their King face down the law.

When had they started calling him that? The King of Level 8. Uncle Nico to the children, but The King to everyone else. He'd tried to discourage it, but nicknames had momentum, and this one had stuck like grease.

"Commander Wright," Nico said, keeping his voice level. "What can I do for you? You here for breakfast? We're serving congee today, pretty good if I say so myself."

Wright's expression didn't change. "Mr. Chen. I'd like a word. In private."

"Sure. Office is in the back."

They walked through the restaurant in silence, and Nico felt every eye on them. Felt the tension, the worry, the barely suppressed anger from people who'd come to depend on what he provided. If Wright arrested him now, in front of everyone, what would happen? A riot? Or would they all just watch, trained by years on Level 8 to know that fighting authority only got you hurt?

The office was cramped with three people—Nico, Wright, and Kade who'd followed despite Nico's claim this was his problem. Wright took in the space with a single glance: the desk covered in invoices and supply orders, the schedule board showing meal rotations, the photographs on the wall of staff and regular customers.

"Nice operation you've built here," Wright said. His voice was measured, precise. Everything about him was controlled. "Four restaurants, one clinic, two housing initiatives, a job placement program, and a community garden project. Quite the empire for a man who was sleeping in a pod six months ago."

"People needed help. I had resources. Seemed logical to connect the two, yeah?"

"Mm." Wright pulled out a tablet, identical to the one Tanaka had used, but somehow more threatening in his hands. "I've read Specialist Tanaka's report. I've reviewed your financial documentation. Your uncle's death certificate from Europa Station, the will, the transfer records. All very thorough."

"Good."

"Too thorough, actually." Wright set the tablet on the desk. "In my twenty years with SSS, I've investigated hundreds of financial crimes. Money laundering, embezzlement, fraud, racketeering. And I've learned something: legitimate money has flaws. Inheritance paperwork has mistakes, delays, family disputes. Real money comes with real complications."

"So you're saying my paperwork is too clean?"

"I'm saying your paperwork is perfect. Professional-grade forgery, probably cost you fifteen or twenty thousand credits. Well worth it to legitimize fifty million."

The number hung in the air like smoke. Nico kept his face neutral, but his heart hammered. Wright knew. Maybe not how, maybe not where from, but he knew.

"That's a serious accusation, Commander."

"It's not an accusation. It's an observation." Wright moved to the window, looking out at the restaurant, at the people eating their free breakfast. "Here's what I know for certain: six months ago, Nico Chen was a small-time Veil dealer with seventeen arrests and no prospects. Today, Nico Chen is the most influential person on Level 8. You've fed thousands of people, provided medical care to hundreds, housed dozens. Crime in your sectors is down twenty-three percent. Emergency room visits from malnutrition are down forty percent."

"Sounds like I should get an award, not an investigation."

Wright turned back to him, and his expression was harder now. "You should get arrested. Because either you stole that money, or you found money someone else stole. Either way, it's dirty. And you're using it to buy loyalty, influence, and power."

"I'm using it to feed people."

"You're building a kingdom."

The word landed like a blow. Kingdom. That's what it was, wasn't it? Not a charity operation, not a mutual aid network. A kingdom, with Nico as its king, and every meal he served was another citizen swearing fealty.

"If that's what feeding people makes it, then yeah," Nico said. "I'm building a kingdom."

"That makes you dangerous."

"To who? The corps that let Level 8 starve? The system that keeps people trapped in poverty? Yeah, I'm dangerous to them. Good."

Kade made a warning sound, but Wright just studied Nico with those calculating eyes. "You're angry. That's understandable. Level 8 is a failure of station policy, and you're right to be angry about it. But anger doesn't give you the right to operate outside the law."

"The law sure as hell doesn't give me the right to operate inside it." Nico stepped closer, his own anger rising now. "You know what I did, Commander? I applied for housing on Level 6. Followed every rule, filled out every form, paid every fee. Denied because I have a record. Tried to start a legitimate business. Denied because I couldn't provide employment references. Tried to get into addiction treatment—real treatment, not the warehouse programs. Denied because I didn't have insurance or savings."

"So you decided to take stolen money and play savior?"

"I decided to use money that was sitting unused in dead accounts to help people who are dying in the here and now. If that's a crime, arrest me."

"I can't arrest you." Wright's voice went flat. "That's the problem. I know you're dirty, but I can't prove it. Your documentation will hold up in court. Specs did good work—yes, we know about Specs, don't look surprised. But knowing and proving are different things. So I can't arrest you."

"Then this conversation is over."

"Not quite." Wright picked up his tablet. "Here's what's going to happen, Mr. Chen. You're going to continue your charity operation, because shutting you down now would cause riots. You're going to keep feeding people, housing people, providing medical care. And I'm going to keep watching you. Every transaction, every expansion, every new initiative. And the moment you slip—the moment you do anything that gives me legal justification—I will shut this entire operation down and put you in a detention cell for the rest of your life."

"Understood."

"I don't think you do." Wright moved toward the door, then paused. "You think you're a hero. You think you're helping people. And maybe you are. But you're also showing them something they can never have sustainably. You're teaching them that the system can be circumvented with money and willpower. And when your money runs out, or when I finally catch you, these people you've helped are going to be worse off than before. Because you'll have given them hope, and then taken it away."

The words hit harder than any threat of arrest.

"So what should I do?" Nico asked quietly. "Let them starve because helping them might end badly?"

"You should work within the system to change it."

"The system doesn't change. It's designed not to."

"Then maybe that's the real problem, Mr. Chen. And maybe what you're building is the worst possible solution: a temporary kingdom that will collapse the moment you're gone, leaving nothing but wreckage."

Wright left, his footsteps echoing in the sudden silence.

Kade let out a long breath. "Well. Shit."

"Yeah."

"He's not wrong, kid. About the money running out, about what happens when you can't maintain this anymore."

"I know."

"And you're going to keep doing it anyway."

Nico looked out the window at the restaurant, at the people finishing their meals, at children laughing over dumplings, at elderly folks sitting together over tea. Six months ago, some of these people had been dying. Now they weren't.

Was that a kingdom? Was that buying loyalty? Or was it just... helping?

"Yeah," Nico said. "I'm going to keep doing it anyway."

"Even though it might destroy you?"

"Kade, I was already destroying myself. At least this way, something good happens first."

Kade laughed, the dark humor Nico had come to know well. "Fair point. Okay, King Nico. What's next?"

King Nico. The name felt absurd and right at the same time.

"Next?" Nico pulled up his tablet, showed Kade the project list. "We've got that housing block renovation starting next week. The job training program needs more instructors. And Maya says there's a childcare crisis in Sector 12, so I'm thinking we fund a community center."

"You're insane."

"Probably. You still in?"

"Kid, I've been in since you bought that first noodle shop drunk off your ass. I'm in till the end, whatever that looks like."

"Might look like a detention cell."

"Wouldn't be my first." Kade clapped him on the shoulder. "Come on. People out there are worried about what Wright said. You should go reassure them."

Nico walked back into the restaurant, and the worried faces turned toward him. Three hundred people, all looking to him for answers, for security, for hope.

Mrs. Huang spoke first, her elderly voice carrying. "Are they shutting us down?"

"No," Nico said, and his voice came out stronger than he felt. "No, they're not. Commander Wright came by to warn me, to tell me I'm being watched. But we're not doing anything wrong. We're feeding people. We're housing people. We're helping where the system won't. And that's going to continue."

"For how long?" someone called out.

"As long as I can make it happen."

"And if they arrest you?"

Nico hesitated, because that was the real question, wasn't it? What happened when the money ran out or Wright finally found his evidence? What happened to all these people who'd come to depend on what he provided?

"Then you'll do what you've always done," Nico said. "You'll survive. You'll help each other. You'll remember that it's possible to be better than the system wants us to be." He looked around at the faces, some skeptical, some hopeful, all exhausted from lives lived at the bottom. "I'm not your savior. I'm just a guy with money trying to do something decent. But you—all of you—you're what makes this work. Not the credits, not the free meals. The fact that you show up, that you help each other, that you haven't given up. That's what matters."

Silence. Then Lin Zhao, the old woman who'd tested him weeks ago, who'd become something like his conscience, spoke up. "Pretty words, child. Let's see if you can live up to them."

"Trying to, Auntie Lin."

"Mm. Keep trying. And don't let that Commander scare you. Men like that, they think power comes from uniforms and badges. They don't understand that real power comes from people choosing to follow you."

"I don't want people to follow me."

"Too late for that." She smiled, sharp and knowing. "You're The King now, Nico Chen. Whether you like it or not."

The restaurant slowly returned to its normal noise level—people eating, talking, living. But something had shifted. They'd seen Wright come in, seen Nico face him down, seen that the operation would continue.

And that meant something.

Nico returned to the kitchen, where the lunch prep was already underway. Vegetables being chopped, broth simmering, rice steaming. The rhythm of feeding people, day after day after day.

His tablet pinged. Kade, sending him the updated inventory costs. They were spending forty thousand credits a week now on food alone. At this rate, the money would last... what? Twenty years? Thirty?

Not forever. Wright was right about that. This couldn't last forever.

But it could last long enough to matter. Long enough to show people that a different way was possible. Long enough to plant seeds that might grow into something sustainable, something real.

Maybe.

Or maybe he was deluding himself, building a kingdom on sand that would wash away the moment he fell.

But standing in the kitchen of Chen's Noodle House, six months into the strangest journey of his life, Nico Chen decided he didn't care.

He'd been nobody for twenty-eight years. A junkie, a dealer, a fuck-up, a waste of potential. Now he was somebody. Now he mattered.

The King of Level 8.

It was absurd. It was dangerous. It was probably going to end badly.

But for now, for today, it was everything.

"Nico!" One of the kitchen staff called out. "We're low on noodles again. Want me to order more?"

"Yeah," Nico said, pulling on his apron. "Order double. Lunch crowd's going to be big today."

Because that's what kings did, apparently. They ordered noodles and tried to feed their kingdom one meal at a time.

And if that was crazy, well. Nico Chen had never been sane anyway.

Might as well be crazy for something that mattered.

---

That evening, after the restaurant closed, Nico stood on the observation deck at the edge of Level 8. It was a small space, barely maintained, with scratched windows that looked out over the curve of the station. Beyond the windows: Jupiter, massive and swirling, its red spot visible even through the grime.

He came here sometimes when he needed to think.

Maya found him there, as he'd hoped she would. She'd developed a talent for finding him when he needed her.

"Hey," she said softly.

"Hey."

She stood beside him, both of them looking at Jupiter. "I heard about Wright."

"News travels fast."

"It's Level 8. News travels at the speed of gossip, which is faster than light." She bumped her shoulder against his. "You okay?"

"Define okay."

"Fair." A pause. "You know he's going to keep coming for you."

"I know."

"And you're not going to stop."

"Can't stop. Too many people counting on it now."

"That's not why you're not stopping."

Nico glanced at her. "No?"

"No. You're not stopping because for the first time in your life, you feel like you matter. Like you're worth something." Her voice was gentle, without judgment. "And I get that. I really do. But Nico... you mattered before all this. You mattered when you were just surviving. You don't have to be a king to be worth loving."

Something cracked in his chest. "You think I'm doing this for love?"

"I think you're doing this because you never got love. Because your family threw you away, because the system ground you down, because everyone you ever knew told you that you were worthless." She took his hand. "But you're not worthless. You never were. And this—" she gestured back toward the restaurant, toward Level 8, "—this is you proving it to yourself as much as to anyone else."

He wanted to argue. Wanted to say she was wrong, that this was about helping people, about justice, about anything but his own damaged need for validation.

But she wasn't wrong. And they both knew it.

"So what do I do?" he asked quietly.

"Keep going. But do it for the right reasons. Do it because people need help, not because you need to be needed. Do it because it's right, not because it makes you feel worthy." She squeezed his hand. "And remember that when this ends—when Wright finally gets his evidence or the money runs out or whatever happens—you're still you. Still worth something. Still loved."

"You love me?" The words came out before he could stop them.

"I've loved you since we were twenty, you idiot. Before the addiction, during the addiction, and now while you're playing Robin Hood with stolen millions. Nothing's going to change that."

He pulled her close, holding on like she was the only solid thing in a world of shifting sand. She held him back, both of them standing at the edge of Level 8, looking at Jupiter and the endless void beyond.

"I'm scared," Nico admitted. "Terrified, actually. That I'm going to fuck this up. That I'm going to hurt people trying to help them. That Wright's right and I'm just making it worse."

"You might fuck it up. Probably will, honestly. You're still figuring this out." Maya pulled back to look at him. "But fucking up while trying is better than not trying at all. And whatever happens, you'll have people with you. Kade, Lin, me. You're not alone anymore."

"The King of Level 8," Nico said, trying out the title.

"Yeah. And if you're going to be a king, be a good one. Be the kind who serves his people instead of ruling them. Be the kind who admits when he's wrong and asks for help when he needs it." She smiled. "Be the kind who remembers he's still just Nico Chen, junkie and dreamer, who stumbled onto more money than sense and decided to do something crazy with it."

"That's a lot of pressure for a Tuesday."

"You've handled worse."

"Have I, though?"

"You survived Level 8 for ten years. You survived addiction, family abandonment, systemic poverty, and your own worst impulses. Trust me, you can handle being The King."

They stood together in silence, watching Jupiter spin, watching their reflection in the scratched windows. A social worker and a dealer. A dreamer and a cynic. Two people from Level 8 who'd somehow ended up on the other side of impossible.

"Okay," Nico said finally. "Okay. I'll keep going. But on one condition."

"What's that?"

"You keep reminding me who I am. When I start believing the King bullshit too much, when I start thinking I'm special instead of just lucky, you remind me."

"Deal. And you do the same for me when I start thinking I can't make a difference."

"Deal."

They shook on it, and then Maya kissed him, quick and soft, and walked away before he could react. He stood there, stunned, touching his lips like an idiot.

When he finally returned to the restaurant to close up for the night, Kade was waiting.

"So," Kade said. "The King of Level 8. How's it feel?"

"Terrifying. Exhilarating. Completely fucking insane."

"Good. That means you're doing it right." Kade pulled out two bottles of water—they'd both cut back on Veil lately, not quit but trying—and tossed one to Nico. "To kingdoms built on stolen money and good intentions."

"To tiny rebellions against systems that deserve to burn."

"To surviving another day in hell and making it a little less hellish."

They drank, two addicts and criminals and accidental revolutionaries, standing in a noodle shop on Level 8 at the ass-end of the solar system.

It wasn't much.

But it was theirs.

And for now, that was enough.

The King of Level 8 had work to do tomorrow.

Kingdoms didn't build themselves.

Even temporary ones.

Even impossible ones.

Even ones destined to end badly.

For now, they existed.

And that was everything.
