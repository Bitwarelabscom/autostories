# Chapter 12: Expansion

Two weeks after opening Chen's, Nico bought his second restaurant.

Then his third.

Then his fourth.

The demand had been immediate and overwhelming. By day three, they were feeding three hundred people. By day seven, five hundred. The line wrapped around entire districts, and Nico was spending thirty thousand credits a day just on supplies.

So he did what made sense: he scaled up.

The second purchase was Kumar's Curry Kitchen in District Three—smaller than Chen's, but the owner was retiring and willing to sell cheap. Seventy-five thousand credits, and Nico had it converted to free meals within forty-eight hours. Kumar himself stayed on to train new cooks, teaching them his recipes like he was passing on family secrets.

The third was a failed bar in District Seven that Nico gutted and rebuilt as a breakfast service. Eggs, synth-protein, carb bricks. Not fancy, but filling. Open 0600 to 1000 every morning. Cost him ninety thousand to buy and another fifty to remodel.

The fourth was the big one: Zhao's Family Restaurant, prime location in District Two, three times the size of Chen's. The owner wanted two hundred thousand. Nico paid two-fifty and hired Zhao's entire staff at double their previous wages.

Four restaurants. Seven meal services per day across different times and locations. Fourteen hundred people fed daily, each one no charge, no questions asked.

Nico had become Level 8's biggest employer and charitable organization in two weeks.

Kade found him in the back office of Chen's—which had become Nico's unofficial headquarters—surrounded by spreadsheets and supply orders. Jian's sister Wei had set up a proper inventory system, and Nico was learning terms like "bulk purchasing" and "supply chain optimization" at a pace that would have impressed his old engineering professors.

"You're insane," Kade said, dropping into a chair. "You know that, yeah?"

"Good morning to you too." Nico didn't look up from his tablet. "The Level 7 produce suppliers are trying to jack up prices now that they know I'm buying in bulk. Think I should find Level 6 suppliers? Better quality, but higher base cost..."

"Kid. Look at me."

Nico looked up. Kade's expression was serious in a way that made Nico's stomach tighten.

"What?"

"You just spent over half a million credits in two weeks. You're feeding over a thousand people daily. Every gang leader in Level 8 knows your name now. SSS has started asking questions. And—" Kade pulled out his tablet, showed Nico a news feed. "You made the Level 6 local news."

The headline read: "Mysterious Benefactor Transforms Level 8 Food Access—Who Is Nico Chen?"

Nico's mouth went dry. "Fuck."

"Yeah. Fuck." Kade set down the tablet. "You're not invisible anymore. People in the middle tiers are talking about you. Some think you're a saint, some think you're running a scam, some think you're a gang front. But they're all talking."

"I'm just feeding people—"

"You're destabilizing the economic model." Kade leaned forward. "Think about it. You're paying above-market wages, providing free food, taking workers out of the exploitative gig economy. Employers in Level 8 are pissed because people would rather work for you. Middle-tier businesses are asking why their Level 8 contract workers aren't showing up anymore—because they're eating your free meals and taking your jobs instead."

"Is that... bad?"

"It's revolutionary. Which is dangerous." Kade ran a hand through his hair. "I'm not telling you to stop. I'm telling you to be careful. You've got maybe a month before the system pushes back hard."

Nico looked at his tablet, at the spreadsheets showing daily costs and supply needs. Forty-seven thousand credits yesterday. Probably fifty thousand today. He was hemorrhaging money.

But he was also employing thirty-two people now. Feeding fourteen hundred. And the messages kept coming—thank you notes, job applications, people asking if he'd open more locations.

"I'm not stopping," Nico said.

"Didn't think you would." Kade stood. "But you're going to need more than restaurants soon. Medical's the next crisis. You know how many people are dying from treatable shit because they can't afford clinic fees?"

Nico hadn't thought about medical care. He'd been so focused on food.

"How much would it cost to... I don't know, cover people's medical bills?"

"Depends. The Level 8 clinic charges five hundred credits for basic treatment, two thousand for anything serious. Say you cover a hundred people a week—that's fifty thousand minimum, probably more like two hundred thousand once word spreads that you're paying."

"I've got the money."

"For how long?" Kade's voice was gentle. "You've got maybe forty-nine million left. You're burning through five hundred thousand a week right now. Add medical, you're looking at seven hundred thousand. That's about seventy weeks—call it a year and a half—before you're broke."

The math hit Nico like cold water. A year and a half. That was it. All his money, all his newfound purpose, it had an expiration date.

"So what do I do?" he asked quietly.

"Figure out what you're actually trying to accomplish." Kade moved toward the door. "Are you trying to help people survive, or are you trying to change something bigger? Because survival charity has a time limit. System change requires a different strategy."

He left before Nico could answer. Probably because Nico didn't have an answer.

Nico bought the clinic anyway.

Not the whole clinic—he couldn't, it was Station property. But he set up an account with Dr. Rachel Okafor, the woman who ran Level 8's only legitimate medical facility, and told her to bill him for any patient who couldn't pay.

"All of them?" Dr. Okafor had asked, looking at him like he was delusional.

"All of them," Nico confirmed.

She'd laughed. "You'll be bankrupt in a month."

"Let me worry about that."

The first week, medical costs were thirty thousand credits. The second week, seventy-five thousand. By the third week, Dr. Okafor was running double shifts and had hired two more nurses, and the bills were hitting one hundred and fifty thousand.

People were getting treatment. The maintenance worker with the infected wound that had been getting worse for months. The woman with the cough that turned out to be treatable respiratory disease. The kid with the broken arm that had healed wrong because they couldn't afford to set it properly the first time.

Nico paid for it all.

And hated every minute of knowing he couldn't keep it up forever.

It was Maya who found him three weeks into the expansion, sitting in Chen's at 0200 hours, unable to sleep, running numbers that wouldn't add up right.

"You should be home," she said, sliding into the seat across from him.

"Don't have a home. Gave up my pod. I crash in different restaurants depending on where I'm needed." Nico rubbed his eyes. "What are you doing here?"

"I work in Level 8, remember? One of my clients told me you were paying for medical care now. I had to see if it was true." She looked around the empty restaurant. "You've done something remarkable, Nico."

"I've done something unsustainable."

"That too." Maya smiled sadly. "You know I have to report this, right? The money's source is still unexplained. That triggers financial investigation protocols."

Nico's stomach dropped. "You're going to report me?"

"I haven't yet. My supervisor's been asking why I haven't." She met his eyes. "But I can't protect you forever. Station Security Services doesn't ignore this level of unusual financial activity. Especially not when it's someone with your background."

"So I've got maybe a month before they investigate?"

"Maybe less." Maya paused. "What's your plan when they do?"

"I don't have one." Nico gestured at his tablet. "I'm making this up as I go. Feeding people, covering medical bills, trying to keep up with demand. I don't know what I'm doing, Maya. I just know I can't stop."

"Why not?"

"Because—" He stopped. Why couldn't he stop? "Because people are depending on me now. Thirty-two employees. Fourteen hundred people getting meals daily. However many are going to Dr. Okafor because they can finally afford treatment. If I stop, what happens to them?"

"They go back to how things were before."

"Which was slow starvation and untreated illnesses."

"Yes." Maya's voice was soft. "You've given them something better. Even if it's temporary, that matters."

"Temporary isn't enough."

"Then figure out how to make it permanent." She stood. "But do it fast. Because SSS is going to come for you, Nico. And when they do, you better have answers."

She left. Nico sat alone in the empty restaurant, surrounded by the smell of food and the ghost of fourteen hundred people who needed him not to fail.

Kade's question echoed: *Are you trying to help people survive, or are you trying to change something bigger?*

Nico didn't know.

But he had maybe a month to figure it out.
