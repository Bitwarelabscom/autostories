# Chapter 34: The Fugitive King

Three weeks after the riot, Nico still hadn't been seen publicly.

He lived in safe houses, changing locations every three days. Never the same pattern. Never the same route.

Kade managed his movements. Maya coordinated operations remotely. Lin served as his public face, delivering messages and directives without revealing his location.

The King of Level 8 had become a ghost.

But ghosts could still work.

Morning brought encrypted messages: requests for funding, decisions needed, problems only he could solve.

Cooperative #17 needed startup capital. Approved: 5,000 credits.

Defense committee requesting medical supplies. Approved: 3,000 credits worth.

Three families evicted, needing emergency housing. Referred to Housing Collective #4, funded: 2,000 credits for transition support.

One by one, Nico processed requests from hiding. Less direct than before, but still functioning.

Still mattering.

Still unable to stop.

The paranoia was constant. Every sound might be SSS. Every shadow a threat.

He'd developed three escape routes from each safe house. Kept a go-bag packed. Slept in clothes, ready to run.

The Veil use had gotten worse. Six cartridges a day now. Maybe seven. He'd stopped counting because counting made it real.

Functional addict in hiding, running a shadow operation from anonymous rooms.

"You look like hell," Kade said during one of his supply runs.

"I feel like hell."

"When's the last time you slept more than four hours?"

Nico couldn't remember. "Does it matter?"

"Yeah, actually. You're making million-credit decisions on no sleep and too much Veil. That's how mistakes happen."

"I don't have the luxury of rest. People need—"

"People need you alive and coherent. Not burnt out and paranoid." Kade sat down. "Lin's been running point on most operations. Maya's handling the clinic network. I'm coordinating security. What exactly do you think you're doing that we can't handle?"

"Final decisions. Approval authority. Vision."

"Bullshit. You're doing it because you can't let go. Because if you're not needed, you don't know who you are."

The accusation hit hard because it was true.

"I'm the one with the money."

"You're the one who can authorize transfers. That's not the same thing. We could set up protocols, delegation structures. Let other people make smaller decisions. You focus on strategic direction."

"And if they make wrong choices?"

"Then they learn. Same as you did." Kade's voice softened. "Nico, you're killing yourself. Slowly. Every week, you're more paranoid, more exhausted, using more. You think I don't notice?"

"I'm managing."

"You're surviving. There's a difference."

A sound outside—footsteps in the corridor. Nico was on his feet instantly, hand on the hidden exit panel.

Kade didn't move. "It's just neighbors, man. You're jumping at everything."

"I'm being careful."

"You're being paranoid. Which I get—SSS wants you dead or arrested. But you can't live like this indefinitely. Something's got to give."

"When Corporate stops hunting me, I'll relax."

"Corporate will never stop hunting you. That's the point. They can't let you win, even symbolically. So you need to decide: are you going to hide forever, or are you going to actually build something they can't tear down?"

"I'm building cooperatives—"

"You're funding cooperatives. Other people are building them. You're a bank, Nico. A very generous, very paranoid bank. But you're not organizing anymore. You're not teaching. You're just transferring credits and jumping at shadows."

The words stung.

Because they were true.

Somewhere between the riot and now, Nico had stopped being a leader and become a checkbook.

Important, maybe. Necessary, possibly.

But replaceable.

"What do you want from me?"

"I want you to delegate. Set up a council of people you trust. Give them spending authority up to certain limits. Let them handle day-to-day operations. You focus on big picture—strategy, messaging, crisis response. Not whether Cooperative #17 gets 5K or 6K."

"If I delegate, I lose control."

"If you don't delegate, you lose your mind." Kade stood. "Think about it. Because right now, you're a bottleneck. Operations are waiting on you. People can't move fast because they're waiting for Uncle Nico's approval. You're slowing things down."

He left.

Nico sat alone in the safe house, surrounded by encrypted tablets and vape pens and paranoia.

Kade was right. Of course he was right.

But letting go meant admitting he wasn't essential. That the operation could run without him.

That maybe it should.

---

That night, Nico drafted a proposal: Advisory Council. Five people he trusted. Spending authority up to 10K credits each without his approval. Regular meetings for strategic direction.

Maya, Kade, and Lin would be obvious choices. Two more slots for cooperative leaders who'd proven themselves.

He stared at the proposal for an hour.

Transferring power meant admitting he wasn't the King anymore. Just a fugitive with money, hiding in safe houses while others did the actual work.

It meant facing the truth: that he'd been more hindrance than help lately.

That his paranoia and exhaustion and addiction were liabilities.

That the operation would probably run better without him.

The truth hurt.

But it was still truth.

Nico authorized the proposal. Sent it to the others.

Then he lay down in the dark and tried to sleep.

Failed.

Jumped at every sound.

Recited the forty-seven names.

Took another hit.

And waited for dawn.

The Fugitive King, slowly realizing his kingdom had outgrown him.

Somehow, that hurt worse than anything else.
