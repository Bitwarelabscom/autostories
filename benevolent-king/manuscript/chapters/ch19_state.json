  "notes": "Montage chapter covering 3 weeks of transformation. Title 'Building the Kingdom' shows scope of what Nico's created—not just charity, but alternative economic system. Key shift: from king/savior to teacher. Lin's group provides expertise he lacks (cooperatives, organizing, education). The economics are stark: 84M/year burn vs 42M remaining = 6 months. But he's using that time to build lasting structures. Worker co-ops show people becoming owners, not dependents. Resident councils decentralize decision-making. Health worker training builds capacity. Maya's framing: demonstration project proving alternatives exist. When money ends, people will demand Station provide what Nico did. Arc 0.68—approaching climax, transformation nearly complete. Wright's summons ends chapter on tension—reckoning has come. Kade's line 'you built something good' is benediction before confrontation. The kingdom is built; now comes the test. This chapter shows evolution from individual charity (ch11) to collective structures (ch19)—the growth Lin demanded."
