  "notes": "First bridge chapter after midpoint. Shows the immediate aftermath of Ch10's drunken decision becoming real. The line forming at 0800 demonstrates how fast word spreads in close-knit lower-tier communities. Nico's realization that he'd 'stopped seeing' the hunger around him is key character development—moving from self-absorption to community awareness. The volunteers (Jian, Mara, Lee) all have their own desperate needs, showing this isn't just charity—it's mutual aid. They need the work as much as people need the food. Kade's warning about hope being dangerous is thematically important: charity/mutual aid creates expectations and can be the spark for larger movements. Nico's arc position moves to 0.28—he's actively transforming his identity. The sensory details (people crying while eating, father sharing bowl, teenager asking for seconds) make the hunger visceral and real. The number 113 is specific and significant—each person matters. Nico's exhaustion but determination shows he's found purpose beyond using. His final line 'I'm done failing people' is character-defining. The scale issue is planted: tomorrow will be 200-300 people, requiring exponential growth of operation. This chapter establishes the pattern: Nico makes impulsive generous decision → has to figure out logistics → meets immediate needs → realizes it's bigger than expected → must scale up. Also establishes his growing team."
