  "notes": "First bridge chapter in the 'failed escape' arc (Chapters 6-9). Shows the brutal reality of systemic barriers in action. The housing administrator isn't cruel or unusual - she's following standard procedure. The system itself is the antagonist. Nico's class markers (appearance, speech, mannerisms) immediately identify him as not belonging, triggering assumptions and rejections before he even speaks. His attempt to prove he has money backfires - wealthy people don't act desperate or need to prove anything. The revelation of Section 47-B makes explicit what's been implicit: drug charges are designed to permanently trap people in lower tiers. This isn't a bug, it's a feature. Nico's arc barely moves (0.12) because he's still in reactive mode, still believing he can buy his way up if he just finds the right approach. The chapter ends with him doubling down on money-as-solution, not yet ready to accept that escape is impossible. Kade's warning about marks sets up Ch 7. The administrator's pity is almost worse than contempt - she assumes he's lying because the idea of a Level 8 junkie with real wealth is incomprehensible to her worldview."
