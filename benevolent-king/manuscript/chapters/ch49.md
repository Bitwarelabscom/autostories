# Chapter 49: Spread of Movement

The worker organizing wasn't just Level 8 anymore. Level 7 had formed cooperatives. Level 6 had organizing committees. Even Level 5 professionals were unionizing. The movement was spreading. Station-wide. Cross-tier. What started as Nico's charity had evolved into real structural change. Reports came in daily: Food cooperative in Level 7 serving 200 families. Medical collective in Level 6 covering 500 workers. Housing cooperative in Level 9 housing 300 people. All of it organized. Democratic. Sustainable. Corporate was losing control. Not violently. Not dramatically. Slowly. Systematically. One cooperative at a time. One organized workplace at a time. Until workers had power. And Corporate couldn't stop it. Because you can't arrest thousands. Can't fire everyone. Can't crush an idea whose time has come.
