  "notes": "Second bridge chapter showing rapid scaling. Three weeks compressed into montage-style narrative showing expansion speed. Key theme: exponential growth brings exponential problems. Nico learns operational management (bulk purchasing, supply chains) while operating beyond sustainable capacity. The math is stark: 700k/week burn rate means 18 months maximum—stakes are clear. Kade's strategic question ('survival vs system change') plants the seed for Book 3's evolution. Maya's torn loyalty adds interpersonal tension to systemic tension. Dr. Okafor's introduction expands Nico's impact beyond food to healthcare—meeting fundamental needs. The detail about Nico having no home (crashes in restaurants) shows his total commitment. News coverage means loss of anonymity—he's now a public figure whether he wants to be or not. The middle-tier worker shortage is a planted seed for Book 2's major conflict. Arc position 0.35 reflects Nico fully committed to this path, learning operational skills, but facing sustainability crisis. Chapter ends with time pressure: one month before system pushback, weeks before SSS investigation. The question 'survival or change?' hangs unanswered because Nico doesn't know yet—he's reacting, not strategizing. This chapter bridges from individual charity (Ch11) to systemic disruption (Ch13+)."
