# Chapter 31: Preparing for War

Kade's old military training kicked in the moment he saw the SSS deployment patterns.

"They're staging," he told Nico, pulling up surveillance data from contacts throughout the station. "Look—increased patrols in Levels 6 and 7. Tactical units running drills. Equipment requisitions for riot gear and non-lethal weapons. They're preparing for something big."

"Another raid?"

"Bigger. The last one was meant to grab you and shut things down quick. This—" Kade highlighted the data, "—this is preparation for occupation. They're planning to come in and stay."

Nico felt his stomach drop. "When?"

"Could be days. Could be weeks. But it's coming."

Maya joined them, tablet in hand. "I'm hearing things from the clinic. SSS has been asking questions. Surveying who we treat, where our supplies come from, how many people we see daily. They're building intelligence for a raid."

"Can we stop it?"

"No," Kade said bluntly. "We can prepare for it, but we can't stop it. They have numbers, training, and authority. We have anger and improvised weapons."

"Then what do we do?"

"We get ready to fight," Kade said. "Or we surrender now and hope they go easy on us."

"They won't go easy," Lin said from the doorway. "Not after the last riot. Not after we've embarrassed them for months. They're coming to break us, and they won't stop until we're broken."

Nico looked around the room. His core team. The people who'd been with him from the beginning.

"I can't ask you to fight," he said. "Any of you. This is—I'm the one they want. Maybe if I just turned myself in—"

"They'd arrest you and raid anyway," Kade interrupted. "You're not the goal. You're the excuse. They want to shut down the entire operation, seize all assets, scatter everyone who's been helping. Making an example."

"Then we give them nothing to seize. Distribute the generators to individual families. Break up the water tanks. Scatter the medical supplies. If there's no central operation, there's nothing to raid."

"That just delays it," Maya said. "And leaves everyone vulnerable without infrastructure."

"So what? We fight? Eight thousand untrained people against SSS tactical units?" Nico's voice rose. "That's not a fight. That's a massacre."

"Maybe," Kade said. "Or maybe it's a message that we're not going quietly. That every inch they take costs them."

"Costs lives, you mean."

"Everything costs lives. Doing nothing costs lives. Fighting costs lives. The question is which cost buys us something worth having."

Nico sat down heavily. The weight of it crushing.

He'd wanted to help people. Feed them. House them. Show them dignity.

And now he was discussing armed resistance against Corporate security.

How the fuck had he gotten here?

"I need options," he said. "Real options. Not just fight or surrender."

Lin pulled up a chair. "Here's what we can do: organize defense committees. Not to attack, but to slow them down. Make the raid expensive and difficult. Meanwhile, we accelerate the cooperative transition. Get as many people as possible into self-sustaining networks before the raid. So when it happens, when they scatter us, we have foundations to rebuild on."

"That's still people fighting."

"That's people protecting what they've built. There's a difference."

"Is there?"

"Yes," Lin said firmly. "One is aggression. The other is defense. Corporate's the aggressor here. We're just not going quietly."

Kade nodded. "I can organize defense committees. People who've already decided they're willing to fight. We don't recruit—we identify who's already committed and give them basic training. Barricades, choke points, delay tactics. Nothing offensive, just making it harder for them to sweep through unopposed."

"And when people die?" Nico asked. "When SSS opens fire and bodies start dropping? What do we tell their families?"

"We tell them the truth," Maya said quietly. "That they died defending their community. Their dignity. Their right to exist without Corporate's boot on their neck."

"They'll call us terrorists."

"They already call us freeloaders and welfare queens. We can't control Corporate's narrative. We can only control our actions."

Nico closed his eyes. "Forty-seven people died in the last riot. How many this time? A hundred? Two hundred?"

"Unknown," Kade said. "But here's what I know: those forty-seven didn't die for nothing. They died because they believed this was worth protecting. Honor that belief by making what they protected last."

"By getting more people killed?"

"By refusing to let their deaths be the end of the story."

The room fell silent.

Outside, Level 8 was going about its evening. People cooking in cooperatives. Kids playing in streets. Generators humming, water flowing, life continuing.

For now.

"Okay," Nico said finally. "We prepare. Defense committees for those who choose to fight. Cooperative acceleration for those who choose to build. Scattering of assets so there's less to seize. And I—" he paused, "—I go public. Make it clear this is Corporate's choice, not ours. That we're not attacking anyone, just protecting what we've built."

"Going public means arrest," Maya warned.

"Maybe. Or maybe it means Corporate has to justify the raid publicly. Make it harder for them to massacre people quietly." Nico stood. "I'm done hiding. If they want me, they can come get me. But I'm not making it easy, and I'm not letting them pretend this is law enforcement. It's war. And I'm going to make sure everyone knows who started it."

Kade smiled. Actual smiled. "Now you're talking like a king."

"Or a dead man."

"Sometimes that's the same thing."

---

By midnight, the word had spread: The King was preparing for war.

Defense committees formed. Two hundred people volunteering to slow the SSS advance. Another five hundred offering to support—food, water, medical aid, communications.

Cooperatives accelerated their organizing. Food networks, housing collectives, medical cost-sharing. Building systems that didn't need Nico's money.

And Nico himself recorded a message, broadcast across social networks:

"My name is Nico Chen. For four years, I've used money I found to help people in Level 8. Fed them. Housed them. Gave them medical care. Corporate calls this illegal. I call it necessary.

"They're planning a raid. They're going to try to shut us down. Seize our generators, our water, our medical supplies. Arrest anyone who's helped. They'll call it law enforcement. But we know what it really is: punishment for refusing to starve quietly.

"I'm not telling anyone to fight. I'm not calling for violence. But I am saying this: if you choose to protect what we've built, I stand with you. If you choose to organize for the future, I support you. And if Corporate wants me, I'm right here. Level 8, Jade District, Chen's Noodle House.

"Come and get me.

"But know that every person you arrest, every asset you seize, every life you take—it's a choice you're making. Not us. You.

"We're just trying to survive.

"You're the ones making it a war."

The message went viral within an hour.

Corporate's response came at dawn: SSS units mobilizing.

The raid was coming.

And Level 8 was ready.

As ready as they could be.

Which might not be ready enough.

But it was all they had.
