# Chapter 18: The First Betrayal

The theft was discovered on a Tuesday.

Wei—Jian's sister, the supply chain manager—came to Nico with printouts from the inventory system. Her face was carefully neutral, which meant the news was bad.

"We're short," she said, spreading the reports on the table. "Forty thousand credits worth of supplies. Food stock, medical supplies, equipment."

Nico scanned the numbers. "How does forty thousand in supplies just disappear?"

"It doesn't. Someone took it." Wei pointed to a series of transactions. "These requisitions were approved using your secondary authorization code. The one you gave to your core staff."

There were eight people with that code. People Nico trusted.

"Could it be a mistake? Database error?"

"I checked three times. The supplies were requisitioned, logged out, and never made it to any of our locations. They're gone. And someone covered the digital trail pretty well—I only caught it because I do manual inventory checks."

Nico sat down heavily. Forty thousand credits. Not enough to break him, but enough to hurt. And more than the money, it was the betrayal. Someone he'd trusted, someone he'd helped, had stolen from him.

Had stolen from the operation. From the people they were supposed to be feeding.

"Can you tell who?" he asked.

Wei hesitated. "The requisitions were made from Kumar's Curry terminal. Narrows it down to five people who work that location."

Kade appeared in the doorway. He'd been listening. "Give me the names."

---

They found Marcus Chen—no relation—in his pod two levels down. He was one of Nico's earliest hires, working as a server at Kumar's. Quiet guy, mid-thirties, had two kids he was supporting alone after his partner died.

Kade didn't need to threaten him. The look on his face when they showed up was enough.

"How much did you sell it for?" Nico asked. Kept his voice level. Calm.

Marcus wouldn't meet his eyes. "Thirty thousand. To a Level 7 supplier. They resell it to other restaurants."

Twenty-five percent loss on the resale. Desperation pricing.

"Why?" Nico asked.

"My daughter needs surgery. Genetic condition, heart defect. Dr. Okafor said it's five hundred thousand for the procedure at Level 5 medical. I've been saving but..." Marcus's voice cracked. "She's got maybe six months. I needed money fast."

Nico felt something twist in his chest. The surgery. The dying daughter. The impossible choice between honesty and survival.

"You could have asked me," Nico said quietly.

"I did! Three weeks ago. You said you'd look into it, but there were other cases ahead of mine, other families with more urgent needs. You were doing the math, figuring out who to save first." Marcus finally looked up, eyes red. "She's my daughter. I can't wait for you to get around to her."

And there it was. The ugly truth Lin had showed him with her test. Limited resources, unlimited need. Someone always left behind.

Marcus had been left behind, so he'd taken what he needed.

Kade's hand was on his weapon. "What do you want done with him?"

The question hung there. What did Nico want done?

Marcus had stolen forty thousand credits from an operation feeding fourteen hundred people. Had used Nico's trust to take supplies meant for hungry families. That couldn't go unpunished, or everyone would think they could steal from Uncle Nico.

But Marcus had stolen to save his daughter. The same daughter Nico would have helped if he'd had better systems, better organization, better everything.

The same daughter who would die in six months if she didn't get surgery.

"Nico," Kade said quietly. "People are watching. You let this slide, it sends a message."

"I know."

"You need to make an example."

"I know."

Nico looked at Marcus. Saw desperation that mirrored his own from three months ago. Someone trapped by impossible systems, making bad choices to survive.

"The surgery," Nico said finally. "Five hundred thousand?"

Marcus nodded, confused.

"I'll pay for it. Full amount. Your daughter gets her surgery." Nico stood. "And you're fired. Banned from all my locations. You try to come back, try to take anything else, and Kade's guys deal with you. Understand?"

"I... yes. Thank you. Uncle Nico, thank you—"

"Don't thank me. You stole from people who were starving. I should do worse." Nico moved toward the door, paused. "Get your daughter the surgery. Then figure out how to live with what you did."

They left. Walked back toward Chen's in silence.

Finally, Kade spoke: "That was weak."

"I know."

"You rewarded him for stealing."

"I saved a kid's life."

"You showed everyone that stealing from you works. That if they have a sob story, you'll pay them anyway." Kade stopped walking, faced him. "Within a week, five more people will have dying relatives who need expensive surgery. You going to pay for all of them?"

"If I have to."

"You can't. You barely have ten months of money left. You can't save everyone, kid. And trying to just makes you a target."

"So what should I have done?" Nico's voice rose. "Let the daughter die? Break Marcus's hands like we did to the firebomber? Make an example by being cruel?"

"Yes!" Kade's expression was frustrated. "Not the killing part—but consequences that actually mean something. Fear works, Nico. Charity makes you loved. Fear makes you respected. You need both."

"I don't want to be feared."

"Too bad. You're the King of Eight. Kings who are only loved get overthrown. Kings who are feared stay in power."

They reached Chen's. Inside, word had already spread. Staff were watching Nico, waiting to see how he'd react, what it meant that Marcus had been caught and punished with money.

Jian pulled Nico aside. "People are talking. Saying you're soft. That anyone with a sad story can steal from you."

"Let them talk."

"Nico." Her voice was serious. "I built this inventory system. I caught this theft. The next one, I might not catch. And if people think stealing is profitable..." She trailed off.

He knew what she meant. One theft would become five. Five would become twenty. The operation would bleed money until there was nothing left.

But what was he supposed to do? Let Marcus's daughter die to make an example?

That night, alone in Chen's back office, Nico did something he hadn't done in weeks.

He used.

Two vials, one after another. Let the Veil wash away the impossible choices and the fear that he was becoming everything he'd sworn he wouldn't be.

Cruel. Pragmatic. Someone who valued systems over people.

The Veil made it easier. Made the choices blur. Made the weight lighter.

When he came down, hours later, the clarity was worse than the confusion.

He'd tried to be compassionate and had shown weakness. Tried to save a kid and had invited more theft. Tried to be different from the system and had proven you couldn't dismantle power structures with kindness.

Lin's words echoed: *Real leadership isn't making yourself necessary—it's making yourself unnecessary.*

But how was he supposed to make himself unnecessary when every choice he made just created more problems? When compassion looked like weakness and strength looked like cruelty?

Nico pulled up his accounts. Forty-three point five million credits. Nine months, maybe ten.

And a growing list of impossible choices he didn't know how to make.

He was going to fail. Was probably already failing.

But he didn't know how to stop.
