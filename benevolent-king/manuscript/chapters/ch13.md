# Chapter 13: The King of Eight

The first time someone called him "Uncle Nico," he thought it was a mistake.

It was an old woman at Chen's, waiting in line for breakfast. She'd smiled at him—gap-toothed, weathered face creasing with warmth—and said, "Thank you, Uncle. My grandchildren eat because of you."

Uncle. The term of respect for elder men, providers, family.

Nico was twenty-eight and a junkie. He wasn't anybody's uncle.

But it kept happening.

"Uncle Nico fixed the heat in my building," someone told their friend in the breakfast line.

He hadn't fixed it personally—he'd paid to have it repaired after hearing people complain about three weeks without working thermal systems. Fifteen thousand credits to a maintenance contractor. Simple.

"Uncle Nico got my son into medical school."

That one was partly true. The kid had needed entrance exam fees and proof of financial stability. Nico had paid the fees and forged a sponsorship letter. The kid got in. Good for him.

"Uncle Nico gave my sister a job when no one else would hire her."

Yeah, okay, that one was accurate. The sister had a theft conviction from five years ago. Nico had hired her anyway to work at Kumar's Curry. She was the fastest prep cook they had now.

Week by week, the stories accumulated. Some true, some exaggerated, some completely fabricated. Nico had apparently fixed someone's marriage (he hadn't), intimidated a gang leader into leaving a family alone (also no), and personally delivered a baby (definitely fucking not).

But the name stuck.

Uncle Nico. The King of Eight. The Benefactor.

Nico hated it.

"You need to lean into it," Kade said, the two of them sitting in Chen's after hours, sharing a bottle of terrible Level 8 whiskey.

"Lean into what? People making up fairy tales about me?"

"Lean into being their leader." Kade poured another shot. "Because that's what you are now, whether you want it or not. People look to you. They ask your permission for things. They come to you with problems expecting you to fix them."

It was true. Just that day, Nico had been approached by seven different people: someone asking if they could start a community garden and could he fund it (yes, apparently he was funding gardens now), someone else asking him to mediate a dispute between neighbors (he'd had no idea how but tried anyway), a third asking if he'd hire their cousin (he did), a fourth asking if he'd talk to their landlord about illegal rent increases (he'd sent Kade to scare the guy, it worked).

He'd become the person people came to when the official systems failed them.

Which was constantly, because the systems were designed to fail them.

"I'm not a leader," Nico said. "I'm just a guy with money."

"You're a guy with money who decided to spend it on them instead of yourself. That makes you special." Kade's voice was serious. "And they need someone to believe in, kid. Give them that."

"I don't know how."

"You're already doing it. You just don't realize." Kade gestured at the restaurant, at Level 8 beyond it. "You've given them food, medical care, jobs, hope. That's more than Station government ever did. More than social services, more than charity organizations. You've proven that someone gives a shit whether they live or die."

"That's a low bar."

"It's the only bar that matters down here."

Nico drank his whiskey, felt it burn. He was using less these days—not deliberately, just didn't have time. Too busy running four restaurants, managing medical bills, fielding requests for help. The craving was still there, always there, but muted by exhaustion and purpose.

"What if I fuck it up?" he asked quietly. "What if I can't keep this going and everyone starves because they got used to depending on me?"

"Then they'll go back to the way things were before. Scraping by, surviving, figuring it out." Kade refilled both their glasses. "But at least you'll have tried. That's more than anyone else did."

The restaurant door opened. A young guy—maybe twenty, nervous energy—stepped in, saw Nico, approached the table with the careful deference of someone meeting someone important.

"Uncle Nico? Sorry to bother you, but—my building's water system is down. Has been for three days. Landlord won't fix it. There's forty families, lots of kids. I heard you... that you sometimes help with things like this?"

Nico looked at Kade, who raised his eyebrows. *Your call.*

Forty families. Kids. Three days without water.

"Yeah," Nico said. "I can help. Give me your building address."

The young guy's face lit up with relief so pure it hurt to see. "Thank you, Uncle. Thank you so much."

He left. Nico pulled up his tablet, found a contractor, sent a message asking for a water system repair and what it would cost. The reply came back fast: twelve thousand credits.

Nico approved it.

"That's the seventh thing today," Kade observed.

"I know."

"Your burn rate just went up again."

"I know."

"You're not going to last eighteen months at this pace. Maybe twelve."

"I know." Nico set down his tablet, rubbed his eyes. "But what am I supposed to do? Tell that kid no, his families can go without water?"

"No. You're supposed to accept that you're their king now, and kings don't get to say no when their people need help."

"I'm not a fucking king."

"Tell them that." Kade nodded toward the window.

Nico looked. Outside, people were gathering—twenty, thirty, more. Not a crowd, exactly. More like... witnesses. People who'd heard Uncle Nico was in Chen's and wanted to see him. Wanted to be near someone who gave a shit.

Some held homemade signs: "Thank You Uncle Nico." One family had painted a banner: "The King of Eight—Our Hero."

Nico's stomach churned. This was too much. Too much expectation, too much hope, too much weight.

"I can't be what they need," he said.

"You already are," Kade replied. "That's the problem."

It was Lin Zhao who finally made him understand.

She cornered him three days later at Zhao's Family Restaurant, where he was doing inventory. She was old—seventies, maybe—with iron-gray hair and eyes that had seen too much to be fooled by anything.

"We need to talk," she said. Not a request.

"I'm kind of busy—"

"Now."

Lin Zhao didn't ask twice. Nico followed her to a back table, sat across from her while she studied him like he was a puzzle missing pieces.

"You know what you're doing wrong?" she asked finally.

"Lots of things, probably."

"You're acting like charity." She said it like an insult. "Free food, paid medical bills, fixed buildings. All good things. All temporary."

"I'm trying—"

"You're trying to buy their love. Won't work." Lin's voice was matter-of-fact. "They already love you. Question is, what are you going to do with that?"

Nico had no idea how to answer that.

"People call you Uncle. Call you King. You think that's just gratitude?" Lin shook her head. "That's power. Real power. Not Station authority, not corporate control. People power. And you're wasting it on charity."

"I'm helping people survive—"

"Survival isn't enough." Lin leaned forward. "You've shown them life could be different. Shown them someone with resources actually gives a shit. Now they're asking—why can't it always be like this? Why does it take one man with stolen money to make life livable? Why doesn't the system do this?"

"Because the system's rigged."

"Exactly. So stop working around the system and start changing it." She poked his chest. "You want to be Uncle Nico? Fine. But be the uncle who teaches them to fight, not the uncle who just hands out candy."

"I don't know how—"

"Figure it out. Because your money will run out eventually, and then what? They go back to starving? Or they remember you showed them something better was possible, and they demand it from someone else?" Lin stood. "Think about your legacy, child. Make it count."

She left. Nico sat alone at the table, her words echoing.

*Stop working around the system and start changing it.*

*Think about your legacy.*

He pulled out his tablet, looked at his accounts. Forty-six million credits left. Maybe a year. Maybe less.

And when it ran out, what then?

Either everyone went back to how things were before—hungry, sick, exploited—or they'd learned enough to keep going without him.

Charity or change.

Survival or revolution.

The choice was starting to look a lot less like a choice.

But first, he had water systems to fix and families to feed and a kingdom he'd never wanted but couldn't abandon.

Uncle Nico. The King of Eight.

Nico Chen, the junkie dealer who'd accidentally started something he couldn't stop.

He finished his inventory and went back to work.
