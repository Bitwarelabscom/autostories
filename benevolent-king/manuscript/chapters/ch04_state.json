  "notes": "Bridge chapter showing internal processing of the money revelation. The fever dreams reveal his actual desires and his understanding that they're fantasies. Key scene with Maya establishes their relationship dynamic: she cares deeply and keeps trying, he recognizes her efforts but rejects them because he's choosing his addiction consciously. His articulation of why treatment doesn't work is clear-eyed and honest - he's not in denial, he's actively choosing Veil because sobriety means pain. The chapter shows money hasn't changed anything yet - he's still using, still broke (spent money on vials), still rejecting help. Arc barely moves (0.04) because he's in stasis between knowing about the money and acting on it. The coffee shop scene on Level 7 (neutral ground) shows class boundaries and Maya's privilege vs. Nico's reality. Fever Dream #2 foreshadows his actual choice in Ch 10. Theme: money as insufficient solution to fundamental problems. This chapter is necessary to establish that Nico's upcoming choices are about more than just addiction - they're about agency, dignity, and finding purpose outside conventional 'recovery' narratives."
