# Chapter 48: Health Failing

Nico collapsed during a planning meeting. Liver failure. Kidney stress. Cardiovascular damage. Years of Veil use demanding payment. Maya rushed him to an underground clinic. No official records.

His body was failing. But the movement was strong. That was what mattered. He'd taught them to survive without him. Time to prove it.
