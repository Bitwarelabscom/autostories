# Chapter 17: Maya's Dilemma

Maya found the report on her desk Monday morning: Financial Investigation Request—Subject: Nico Chen.

Her supervisor, Dr. Sarah Kim, stood in the doorway.

"You need to sign it," Sarah said. Not unkind, just firm. "It's been three months. Unexplained wealth, large-scale financial activity, subject with criminal record. This should have been filed eight weeks ago."

Maya stared at the form. One signature, and SSS would open a full investigation into Nico's finances. They'd trace the accounts, find the embezzled money, arrest him. Everything he'd built would collapse.

"He's helping people," Maya said quietly.

"That's not relevant to financial crimes." Sarah stepped into the office, closed the door. "Maya, I know you have history with him. I know what he's doing in Level 8 is remarkable. But the law is the law. We can't ignore unexplained wealth just because it's being used for good."

"Why not?"

Sarah blinked. "Excuse me?"

"Why not?" Maya looked up, met her supervisor's eyes. "He's feeding fourteen hundred people daily. Paying for medical care. Employing dozens. The Station government isn't doing any of that. Social services isn't doing it. So why are we trying to stop someone who is?"

"Because the money is likely stolen or laundered—"

"Probably. But from who? Some corporate account that embezzled it from workers in the first place?" Maya stood. "The system extracts wealth from Level 8 constantly. For once, money is flowing the other direction. Why is that the crime we care about?"

Sarah's expression softened. "I understand your frustration. The system is broken in many ways. But we can't just ignore financial crimes because we like the outcome."

"We ignore financial crimes all the time. Upper-tier tax evasion, corporate embezzlement, wage theft. Those investigations take years and rarely result in charges. But a Level 8 resident with unexplained wealth? That gets flagged immediately."

"That's not fair—"

"It's completely fair. It's just uncomfortable." Maya picked up the report. "If I sign this, Nico gets investigated, probably arrested. His operation shuts down. Fourteen hundred people go back to hunger. Thirty-plus people lose their jobs. Dr. Okafor's clinic goes back to turning away patients who can't pay. All the good he's done—erased. Because the money's origin is murky."

"The law doesn't care about good intentions—"

"Maybe it should." Maya set the report down. "I'm not signing it."

Silence. Sarah stared at her.

"Maya, if you don't file this report, I'll have to question your judgment. Your ability to maintain professional objectivity."

"Question it then."

"This could cost you your position."

"I know." Maya's hands were shaking but her voice was steady. "But I'm not helping the system destroy the only person actually helping Level 8 residents. I can't."

Sarah was quiet for a long moment. Then she picked up the report.

"I'll give you until Friday," she said finally. "Think about this carefully. Your career, your housing status, everything you've built—you're risking it all for a drug dealer with stolen money."

"He's more than that."

"Maybe. But the Station won't see it that way." Sarah moved to the door, paused. "Friday, Maya. Make your choice."

She left. Maya sat alone in her office, hands still shaking.

---

She found Nico at Chen's that evening, doing inventory. He looked exhausted—thinner than three months ago, dark circles under his eyes, the restless energy of someone running on fumes.

"Maya," he said, looking up. "Everything okay?"

"No." She sat down across from him. "I need to tell you something."

His expression shifted. He knew. Somehow, he knew.

"SSS investigation," he said. Not a question.

"Financial crimes. My supervisor wants me to file the report by Friday."

"Are you going to?"

Maya looked at him—really looked. Saw the man who'd been her friend before addiction, the person he'd become under its weight, and now... something new. Something she didn't quite recognize. Purpose-driven. Determined. Still broken but building something anyway.

"I don't know," she admitted. "If I don't file it, I lose my job. Probably my housing. Everything I've spent fifteen years building."

"Then file it." Nico's voice was matter-of-fact. "Don't throw away your life for me."

"It's not just for you. It's for what you're doing. The people you're helping."

"They'll survive without me. They survived before." He went back to his tablet, typing something. "I always knew this was temporary. Maybe it's better if it ends now, before I fuck it up worse."

"You're not fucking it up—"

"I'm building gang security teams and making impossible choices about who deserves help." Nico's laugh was bitter. "Lin's right. I'm just playing savior with stolen money. When it runs out, I'll have left them with nothing but empty bellies and memories."

"That's not true—"

"It is, though." He looked at her. "You should file the report. Do your job. The system catches up eventually anyway."

Maya sat with that for a moment. The ease with which he accepted defeat. The resignation.

"What if I don't want to?" she asked.

"Then you're an idiot." No malice in it. Just tired truth. "You escaped Level 8, Maya. You made it. Don't throw that away for someone who's still trapped."

"You're not trapped. You're choosing—"

"To spend dirty money feeding people who'll go hungry again when it runs out. Real noble." He closed his tablet. "File the report. Save yourself. At least one of us should make it out."

"Listen to me," Maya said, leaning forward. "What you're doing matters. Yes, it's temporary. Yes, the money's questionable. Yes, you're making it up as you go and probably making mistakes. But you've proven something no one else has—that it's possible to help people. That someone with resources can choose solidarity over self-interest."

"For ten more months."

"Then make those ten months count. Teach people what you've learned. Build something that outlasts you." She reached across the table, grabbed his hand. "Don't give up just because the system's finally noticing."

Nico looked at their joined hands. "I'm not worth losing your career over."

"Maybe not. But the people you're feeding are." Maya squeezed his hand. "I'm not filing the report."

"Maya—"

"I'll tell Sarah I need more evidence. Buy you time. Maybe a month, maybe two. Use it. Figure out how to make this sustainable, or at least how to teach people to keep fighting after you're gone."

"And when you lose your job?"

"Then I lose my job." She smiled, surprised by how calm she felt. "I've been working within a broken system for years, trying to help people while following rules designed to hurt them. Maybe it's time I stopped following rules."

Nico stared at her. "You're serious."

"Completely."

"You're an idiot."

"Probably." Maya stood. "But I'm your idiot. So don't waste this, Nico. Make the time count."

She left before he could argue further. Walked out of Chen's, through Level 8's corridors, back toward the lift to Level 6.

Her apartment. Her job. Her careful, stable, rule-following life.

She'd just put all of it on the line.

For a junkie dealer with stolen money and a reckless charity operation.

For the first time in fifteen years, Maya Torres felt like she was actually helping.

Even if it cost her everything.
