# Chapter 47: Teaching Resistance

The underground organizing sessions happened in rotating locations. Twenty people at a time. Teaching collective action, democratic decision-making, mutual aid principles. Nico attended when he could. Mostly, he watched from safety while others led. Ana Rodriguez was a natural teacher. 'My brother died for this. I won't let his death be meaningless.' She taught direct action tactics. Non-violent resistance. How to organize without getting caught. Students practiced. Failed. Learned. Taught others. The knowledge spread like a virus. Beautiful. Unstoppable. Dangerous. Corporate couldn't arrest ideas. Couldn't seize knowledge. Could only watch as worker power grew. One lesson at a time. One organizer at a time. Resistance wasn't violence. It was education. And it was winning.
