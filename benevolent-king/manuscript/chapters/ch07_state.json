  "notes": "Second bridge chapter in the 'failed escape' arc. Shows Nico learning hard lessons about being marked as lower-tier regardless of money. The con is sophisticated enough to be believable but obvious enough in hindsight to be humiliating. Reeves reading Nico's desperation immediately establishes the power dynamic - Nico thought he was buying help, but he was always the product. The fifty thousand loss is significant (more than most Level 8 residents see in lifetime) but barely dents his fortune, showing the scale disparity. His double-vial use shows addiction intensifying under stress - coping mechanism failing to cope. Maya's message at the end sets up Ch 8 but also shows she's monitoring him, which could feel invasive or caring depending on perspective. Arc position moves slightly (0.15) as Nico accumulates knowledge about systemic barriers, but he's still in the phase of believing he can find a workaround. The chapter title 'The Bribe' is ironic - he tried to bribe someone, got robbed instead, revealing he never had the power he thought money would give him."
