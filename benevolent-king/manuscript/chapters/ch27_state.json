  "notes": "Second tentpole of Book 2 (ESCALATION). Corporate moves from bureaucratic pressure to direct violence via utility cutoff. Crisis reveals both Nico's resourcefulness (immediate response organizing evacuations and buying recyclers) and his ultimate powerlessness (forced to comply and dismantle everything). Key themes: impossible choices, the vulnerability of charity-based systems, weaponization of basic necessities. Character development: Nico sees the limits of being King, Maya's pragmatism hardening, Lin's historical memory informing strategy. The hollow victory—people survived but kingdom falls anyway. Sets up next phase: desperate scrambling before deadlines, leading to eventual riot. Money crisis accelerating (down from 16M to 10.8M in 6 months). Arc position 0.58 for Nico—major setback after growth."
