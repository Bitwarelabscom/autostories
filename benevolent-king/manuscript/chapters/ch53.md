# Chapter 53: Negotiations

The United Workers Collective sent five delegates to negotiate with Corporate. Not demands. Negotiations. Between equals. That alone was revolutionary. The talks lasted days. Corporate offered minor concessions. Workers held firm. 'We want structural change. Not crumbs.' Deadlock. Then a worker delegate said something that shifted everything: 'You need us more than we need you. We can survive without you. Can you survive without us?' The answer was no. Corporate needed workers. Workers had learned they could organize without Corporate's permission. The power balance had shifted. Permanently. After eighteen hours, agreement: Wage increases. Healthcare access. Safety oversight. Legal recognition of cooperatives. Not everything. But real. Structural. Lasting. The workers had won. Not through charity. Through power. Exactly as it should be.
