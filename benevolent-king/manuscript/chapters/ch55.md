# Chapter 55: The Raid Coming

Hassan's intel was specific: 'SSS raid. Tomorrow. 0600. Full tactical deployment. They know your location. They know your escape routes. This is the end, Nico.' Kade immediately started planning. 'I can buy you time.' 'No—' 'Not a discussion. I'm staying. You're going. That's how this works.' The safe house erupted in argument. Maya insisted they all fight together. Lin said Nico needed to survive to transfer the last resources. Nico wanted to surrender, spare everyone. Nobody listened. By midnight, the plan was set: Kade would hold the safe house. Make them think Nico was there. Maya and Lin would get Nico clear. Eight hours. Maybe. Probably not. But enough to matter. Kade loaded his weapon. 'For what it's worth—thank you. For everything. For showing me I mattered.' 'You always—' 'I know. But I needed to hear it.' Dawn was coming. And with it, the end.
