  "notes": "Final bridge chapter in 'failed escape' arc (chapters 6-9). This is Nico's last attempt at conventional success, and the most elaborate—he and Kade built an actual business with real employees and infrastructure (250k investment). The failure is more complete because the effort was greater. Commerce Code Section 89-C makes explicit what's been implicit: the system actively bars lower-tier people from legitimate business ownership, forcing them into informal/illegal economies, which then justifies their continued oppression. Nico's arc position moves to 0.22—he's completed the education phase and is ready for transformation. The chapter ends with him discovering Mrs. Chen's listing, planting the seed for Chapter 10. His emotional state has shifted from desperate hope (chapters 6-8) to acceptance and emerging purpose. The line 'Maybe it starts with someone who has fifty million credits and nothing left to lose' becomes his identity. Thematically, this chapter shows that money without social position is worthless in hierarchical systems—Nico could have a billion credits and still be barred. The shell company was actually a good plan (shows Kade's competence) but the system's database cross-referencing caught it (shows system's sophistication). The two employees who lost jobs when permit was denied are a detail that matters—Nico's failures affect others, foreshadowing his later responsibility for community welfare. His increasing Veil use (now taking it after each failure) shows addiction worsening under stress but also shows him still functional, still thinking, still planning. Ready for transformation."
