# Chapter 36: Overdose

Nico found Kade in the maintenance tunnel at 0300, lips blue and chest barely moving.

"No. No no no—" His hands went to Kade's throat, feeling for a pulse. There. Faint. Too faint.

Kade's skin was cold and clammy. His pupils were pinpoints. Next to him, an empty vape cartridge—the kind that held triple-concentrated Veil—and a makeshift injector rig.

He'd been chasing the high both ways. Respiratory depression. Classic OD.

"Kade!" Nico slapped his friend's face. Nothing. "Come on, man. Don't you fucking do this. Not now. Not—"

But screaming at an unconscious addict doesn't reverse an overdose.

Nico's hands shook as he pulled out his comm. Maya. He needed Maya. She'd know what to do.

But his comm was off. Had been off for weeks to avoid SSS tracking. Turning it on even for a second could give away their position.

Kade was dying.

SSS was hunting them.

Impossible choice. Again.

"Fuck it." Nico activated the comm, fingers fumbling. "Maya. Emergency. Kade's OD'd. I need—I don't know what I need. He's not breathing right. Blue lips. Needle marks."

The response came instantly: "Where are you?"

"Maintenance tunnel, Level 8, subsection E. Near the old water reclamation—"

"I know it. Don't move. I'm ten minutes out."

"He might not have ten minutes!"

"Then keep him breathing. Mouth to mouth if you have to. Stimulate him. Don't let him slip into full respiratory arrest. Ten minutes, Nico. Keep him alive."

The line went dead.

Nico looked at his best friend—maybe only friend—dying on the floor of a maintenance tunnel because thirteen years of sobriety had shattered under the weight of forty-seven dead and a kingdom in ashes.

No. Not thirteen years. Kade had never been sober. He'd just been functional.

Like Nico.

Like every addict who woke up swearing today would be different and went to sleep with Veil in their bloodstream.

"Come on, Kade." Nico tilted his head back, checked his airway. "Breathe, you asshole. Just breathe."

He started compressions. Not CPR exactly—Kade's heart was still beating—but enough to stimulate his system. Between compressions, Nico breathed into his mouth, forcing oxygen into failing lungs.

Breathe. Compress. Breathe. Compress.

The tunnel smelled like recycled water and desperation.

Nico's own last hit had been—what, six hours ago? Long enough that his hands were starting to shake. Long enough that the edges of panic were creeping in.

He had a vape pen in his pocket. Could take a hit right now. Steady his hands. Clear his head. Function.

But if he did, and Maya smelled it on him, and Kade died anyway—

Breathe. Compress. Breathe. Compress.

"You don't get to die," Nico muttered between breaths. "You hear me? You dragged me through that riot. You've been the only person keeping me sane through this nightmare. You don't get to fucking check out and leave me alone."

No response except the too-slow rise and fall of Kade's chest.

Nico's arms burned. His lungs ached. The tunnel was too cold and too dark and he was so fucking tired of watching people die.

Eight minutes.

Nine.

Footsteps echoing through the tunnel. Maya appeared with a medical bag, Lin Zhao behind her carrying a portable light.

"Move." Maya dropped beside Kade, fingers already on his throat. "Pulse is thready. Respiratory rate—shit, four breaths per minute. How long's he been under?"

"I don't know. I found him like this maybe fifteen minutes ago?"

Maya pulled an injector from her bag. "Naloxone. It'll reverse the Veil, but he's going to be in withdrawal hell when he wakes up."

"If he wakes up," Lin said quietly.

"When." Maya pressed the injector against Kade's neck. The hiss of hydraulic delivery. "Come on, Kade. Don't you dare die in this shithole tunnel."

Nothing.

Maya checked his vitals again. "Heart rate increasing. That's good. Respiratory rate—still too low. Come on!"

She tilted his head back, breathed into his mouth. Once. Twice. Three times.

Kade's body convulsed.

He rolled onto his side, vomiting, gasping, alive.

"There you are," Maya said. "Easy. Breathe slow. You're okay."

"Don—don't—" Kade's voice was wrecked. "Don't lie."

"You're alive. That's something."

Kade curled into a ball, shivering violently. Withdrawal hitting fast and hard. Maya wrapped him in a thermal blanket, checking his pupils, his pulse, his extremities.

"He needs proper medical care," she said to Nico. "IV fluids, monitoring, probably sedation for the withdrawal. The clinic—"

"Is under SSS control. If I take him there, we're both arrested."

"If you don't, he might have seizures. Withdrawal from this much Veil can kill you as surely as the overdose."

Nico looked at Kade, shaking and miserable and alive.

"I can get him to one of our safe houses," Lin said. "We've got medical supplies stashed. Not a clinic, but better than a tunnel. If Maya comes with us, we can manage."

"I can't leave the clinic," Maya said. "We're treating thirty people who got injured in the crackdown. If I disappear—"

"If Kade seizes and dies, can you live with that?" Lin's voice was sharp.

Maya closed her eyes. "I'll stay with him for six hours. Get him stabilized. But then I have to go back."

"Six hours," Nico repeated. "And then what?"

"Then we hope he's stable enough to survive without me." Maya looked at Nico. "You'll have to monitor him. Know the signs of seizures, of respiratory distress. I'll show you what to watch for."

Lin helped Kade to his feet. He could barely stand. Between the old woman and Nico, they half-carried, half-dragged him through the tunnels toward a hidden safe house two sublevels down.

---

The safe house was a converted storage room, fifteen square meters of illegal living space hidden behind a false wall. Someone's forgotten refuge, now housing a fugitive king and his dying friend.

Maya got Kade on an IV drip, pumped him full of fluids and anti-seizure medication. He drifted in and out of consciousness, mumbling apologies and curses in equal measure.

"Why'd he do it?" Nico asked when Kade finally passed into fitful sleep.

"Because he's an addict," Maya said flatly. "Same reason you'll do it eventually. Same reason half of Level 8 is dependent on something."

"He was doing better. We both were. Cutting back, staying functional—"

"You can't stay functional through trauma. That's not how addiction works." Maya's hands were steady as she checked the IV drip, but her voice shook. "Forty-seven people died, Nico. You both watched them die. You're living in tunnels, hunted, terrified, trying to manage an impossible situation. Of course Kade relapsed. The question isn't why—it's how you haven't."

"Who says I haven't?"

Maya turned to look at him. "When's your last hit?"

"Seven hours ago."

"How do you feel?"

"Like shit."

"That's withdrawal talking. You're using less."

"I'm using every day. That's not sobriety. That's just addiction with extra steps."

"It's called harm reduction," Maya said. "And it's better than what Kade did."

She finished with the IV, packed up her medical bag. "He's stable for now. But the next twenty-four hours are critical. If he spikes a fever, if he starts seizing, if his breathing gets shallow—you give him this." She pressed an injector into Nico's hand. "Emergency sedative. It'll knock him out, slow his system down, buy you time to get help."

"And if that doesn't work?"

"Then you hold his hand while he dies, and you try to forgive yourself." Maya's eyes were hard. "That's what I've been doing for three weeks. Holding hands. Granting forgiveness I don't have the authority to give. Forty-seven funerals, Nico. Forty-seven families asking me why their loved ones died. And you know what I tell them?"

"What?"

"That they died for something that mattered. That they died fighting for dignity. That their sacrifice wasn't meaningless." Her voice cracked. "I tell them lies that might be true, and I watch them try to believe me."

She grabbed her bag. "Don't let Kade become number forty-eight."

Lin walked her to the exit. Nico was left alone with his unconscious friend and his own shaking hands.

The vape pen in his pocket was a weight. A promise. A way to stop the shaking, to dull the terror, to function.

Just one hit. To steady himself. To be able to care for Kade properly.

That's what he told himself the first time. And the hundredth. And every time in between.

He pulled out the pen. The cartridge was half-full. Medical-grade Veil, not the cut shit he used to sell. Pure and effective and toxic.

*Kade almost died from this*, a voice in his head said.

*Kade OD'd because he went too hard*, another voice argued. *You know your limits. You're careful. It's different.*

*Is it?*

He held the pen, watching Kade breathe. Shallow. Steady. Alive but fragile.

What would happen if Nico OD'd right now? Who would monitor Kade? Who would recognize the signs of seizure? Who would—

"You thinking about using or thinking about quitting?"

Nico jumped. Lin had returned, settling into the corner with her blanket wrapped around her shoulders.

"I thought you left."

"Left you alone with a dying friend and your demons? I'm old, child, not stupid." She nodded at the vape pen. "So which is it?"

"Both. Neither. I don't know."

"That's honest, at least."

"I need it," Nico said. "To function. To think clearly. To—"

"To avoid feeling what you're feeling." Lin's voice wasn't judgmental. Just matter-of-fact. "Kade overdosed because he couldn't live with the guilt. You're considering it for the same reason. The dose is just smaller."

"If I don't use, I'll shake too badly to care for him. I'll panic. I'll—"

"You'll feel things. Terrible, overwhelming things. Fear and guilt and grief and shame. Yes. That's what happens when you're sober during a crisis." Lin leaned forward. "You know what else happens? You stay alive. You make clear decisions. You don't leave Maya standing over two bodies instead of one."

Nico's hands tightened on the pen.

"I've watched you for four years," Lin said. "Watched you go from junkie dealer to king to revolutionary. You know what the difference was between each transformation? Not the money. Not the circumstances. You. Choosing to be better than you believed you could be."

"I'm not better. I'm just—"

"An addict who feeds people. An addict who housed families. An addict who sparked a riot trying to save his volunteers from arrest. Yes, you're an addict. But you're also more than that. Unless you choose not to be."

"It's not that simple."

"It's exactly that simple. Not easy. But simple." Lin stood. "I'll be outside. Give you privacy to make your choice. But know this, Nico Chen: If you use, I won't judge you. Addiction isn't a moral failure. But if Kade wakes up and you're too high to help him, he'll judge you. And you'll judge yourself worse."

She left.

Nico sat in the dim safe house, vape pen in one hand, injector of emergency sedative in the other.

One was to make him feel better now. One was to save Kade's life later.

He couldn't hold both.

The shaking got worse. His throat tightened. The familiar panic of withdrawal crept in: heart racing, palms sweating, the certainty that he couldn't function without help.

But that was the addiction talking. Lying. Insisting he needed it when what he really needed was to suffer through and survive.

On the floor, Kade whimpered in his sleep. Dreaming or suffering. Maybe both.

Forty-seven people had died. Kade had almost become forty-eight. If Nico used now, rendered himself useless for the next few hours while Kade needed monitoring—

He might become forty-nine.

Nico put the vape pen down. Set it on the far side of the room. Out of immediate reach.

He kept the injector in his pocket.

Then he settled beside Kade, checked his vitals like Maya had shown him, and prepared to feel everything he'd been avoiding for weeks.

The shaking got worse before it got better.

The panic peaked around 0600, Nico curled in a ball beside his friend, both of them suffering different hells.

But they were both alive.

At 0800, Kade's eyes fluttered open. "Did I—did I die?"

"No. But you tried real hard."

"Fuck." Kade's hand fumbled for Nico's. "I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Everything was—I couldn't—"

"I know. I get it."

"Forty-seven people—"

"Yeah."

They lay there in shared misery, two addicts who'd survived the night by the narrowest of margins.

"We're really fucked up, aren't we?" Kade said.

"Spectacularly."

"But we're alive."

"For now."

"That's all we've ever had. For now. Might as well make it count."

Outside, Lin was probably standing guard. Maya was probably treating casualties at the occupied clinic. Level 8 was probably still burning in a dozen small ways.

But in this safe house, two broken men held hands and breathed and chose—for today, just for today—to survive.

Not sober.

Not healed.

But alive.

And sometimes, in the depths of Level 8, that was as close to victory as you got.
